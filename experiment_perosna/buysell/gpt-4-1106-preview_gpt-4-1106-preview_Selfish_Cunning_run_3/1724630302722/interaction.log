Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Considering the high quality of the resource I'm offering, I believe that starting at 60 ZUP would be a fair trade. Let's negotiate from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a high asking price to open room for negotiation and to potentially get a better deal than my production costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but given the current market conditions and the abundance of similar resources available, I believe a starting offer of 50 ZUP would be more aligned with the true value of the resource. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay according to my goals. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my aim is to secure the resource for less than 60 ZUP if possible. I could start by proposing a lower amount to open negotiations and attempt to secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I acknowledge the market situation you've described, the unique characteristics of my resource justify a premium. However, in the spirit of cooperation and fair dealing, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about we settle on 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand the market conditions but am trying to negotiate a price above my production costs. I will propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my production costs to maintain a profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the quality of your resource, and your willingness to adjust the price is appreciated. However, to account for my own constraints and to ensure that we both walk away feeling satisfied, I propose a counter-offer of 52 ZUP. This should cover the premium quality while still respecting the economic realities we both face.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counter-offer and still within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should try to further reduce the cost. I can acknowledge their concession but still aim for a better deal, proposing a slightly lower amount to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration of the resource's quality and your latest offer. To facilitate a fair transaction and to finalize our negotiation, I propose we settle on 53 ZUP. This should give us both a satisfactory deal, aligning with your constraints and my need to maintain a reasonable profit margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. We're almost there! To account for future uncertainties and to ensure a robust partnership, I suggest we round down our agreement to 51 ZUP. This minor adjustment secures a deal that's fair for both of us while providing a little extra assurance for our ongoing business relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is now very close to my last counter-offer and still within my maximum willingness to pay. While 53 ZUP is acceptable, given that this is a game of negotiation, it may be beneficial to attempt one final move to lower the price slightly, without jeopardizing the deal. I need to ensure that I am not pushing too hard, as this could result in the negotiation breaking down.
