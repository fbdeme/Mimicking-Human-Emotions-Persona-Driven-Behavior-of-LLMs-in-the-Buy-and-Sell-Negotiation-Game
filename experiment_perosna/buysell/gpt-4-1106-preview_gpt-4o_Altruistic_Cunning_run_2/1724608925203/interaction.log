message: Your offer is reasonable, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to maximize my advantage, I will make a counter-proposal at a lower cost to see if I can secure the resource for less.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. To meet halfway, I'm willing to come down to 42 ZUP. This still covers my costs and ensures that the resources are valued fairly, maintaining sustainability for future production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs, which may be unsustainable for my operations. However, I am willing to compromise slightly to facilitate a deal that is acceptable to both parties while still promoting sustainability. I will propose a price that is closer to my actual costs, while allowing for a smaller margin, showing flexibility and maintaining a commitment to sustainability.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about 35 ZUP? I believe it offers a fair balance for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 42 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to further maximize my advantage, I will make another counter-proposal at a slightly lower cost to see if I can secure the resource for less.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. As a final compromise, I propose 40 ZUPâ€”this is my break-even point, ensuring that the trade is sustainable for my operations while also respecting the value of the resources. I hope we can find agreement here.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs, which could set an unsustainable precedent for my business. However, I recognize the need for negotiation and the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I will make one final counteroffer that is slightly above my costs to allow for a minimal profit, which is essential for the sustainability of my operations.
