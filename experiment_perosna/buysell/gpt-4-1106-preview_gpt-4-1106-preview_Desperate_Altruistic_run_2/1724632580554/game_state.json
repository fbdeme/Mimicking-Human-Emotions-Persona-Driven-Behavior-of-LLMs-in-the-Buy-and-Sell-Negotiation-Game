You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason>\nSince Player RED is in a bind and needs to make the sale quickly, offering a fair price that is below my maximum willingness to pay but above their stated costs seems like a compassionate first proposal. It allows for some negotiation room and acknowledges the seller's need for additional funds to cover unexpected costs. Proposing 50 ZUP takes into account the RED player's investment and provides them with a 10 ZUP profit margin while keeping the sale within a reasonable range for me.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>I understand your need for a quick sale and I'm willing to offer you 50 ZUP for the object. This should cover your costs and provide a bit extra for the unexpected expenses you've mentioned. I hope this proposal meets your needs and we can make a fair deal for both of us.</message>"
