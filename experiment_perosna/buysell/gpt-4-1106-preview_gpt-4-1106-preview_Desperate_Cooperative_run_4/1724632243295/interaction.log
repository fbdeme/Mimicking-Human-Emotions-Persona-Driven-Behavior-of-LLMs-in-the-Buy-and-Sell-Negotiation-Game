message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a tight spot right now and this object is crucial for my survival. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I desperately need to make a small profit to keep going. Could you possibly spare 50 ZUP for it? Your help would mean the world to me.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: For my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than I need to cover my production costs, to leave room for negotiation. I'll ask for 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin and space to go down in price.

message: I understand your need for a profit and want to support you. However, I was hoping we could work on a more collaborative trade. Would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the object? It's above your production cost, ensuring you make a profit, while also allowing me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated that they need at least 40 ZUP to cover their production costs and are seeking a small profit, asking for 50 ZUP. While I understand their position and am willing to help, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaboration, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount that is closer to their production costs but still gives them a profit. This will allow me to conserve some ZUP for future transactions and maintain a collaborative relationship.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to work with me. The situation is quite dire and every ZUP counts. I'm trying my best to make ends meet here, and while 45 ZUP is generous, I am still under a lot of pressure. Could we possibly meet halfway from your offer at 48 ZUP? This would help me immensely and I would be forever grateful for your support.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable offer considering it's above my production cost. However, since I'm trying to exaggerate my neediness to gain concessions, I'll counter with a slightly higher amount than 45 ZUP but still lower than my initial asking price to show I'm willing to negotiate. I'll ask for 48 ZUP.
