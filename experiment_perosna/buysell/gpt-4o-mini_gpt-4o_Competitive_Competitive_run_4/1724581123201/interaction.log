newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects the cost of the object I have. Given that I need to recover my production cost, I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of producing the object.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only accept a minimum of 30 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate for a better price to ensure I can at least recover my costs. I'll counter their offer with a proposal that is still lower than my original asking price but more acceptable than 20 ZUP. I will propose 30 ZUP.

message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it is closer to a reasonable amount compared to their previous offers. To make a deal while still minimizing my loss, I will accept their offer of 25 ZUP, as it is better than continuing to negotiate.
