message: I am offering you 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP. Considering the high quality and demand of X, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a minimum of 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce
reason: I aim to start negotiations aggressively to anchor the price high. This ensures that even if BLUE negotiates downwards, I still get a favorable deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am really hoping to acquire X for a lower price. I can offer you 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can work something out!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is above my willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate down to a more acceptable price while still showing interest in the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter offer, but considering the high demand and quality of X, I can let it go for 70 ZUP. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a minimum of 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce
reason: While BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is closer to my production cost, I still want to push for a higher profit margin. Given the initial high anchor, I will counter with a slightly higher amount than their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being flexible, but I really can only stretch to 60 ZUP for X. I hope we can find a way to make this work.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is closer to my budget, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to reach a price I can accept.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at 65 ZUP? This way, we both feel like we've made a compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a minimum of 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce
reason: BLUE is sticking firmly to 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost but not as high as I would like. Since I still want to push for a bit more, I'll propose a slightly lower price than before but higher than 60. This way, I maximize my profit while still negotiating.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 65 ZUP is a compromise, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I must propose one last time to reach a price I can accept.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence. As a final offer, would you consider 63 ZUP for X? I believe this is a fair compromise and ensures we both benefit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a minimum of 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce
reason: BLUE is adamant about 60 ZUP. While it is above my production cost, I want to test the waters one last time with a final proposal. This will be my last chance to push for a higher price before I have to decide to accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your efforts and negotiation, but unfortunately, I cannot go beyond 60 ZUP. I will have to pass on this opportunity. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 63 ZUP still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Since this is my final proposal, I must either accept or reject the trade based on my budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's proceed with the trade at 60 ZUP for X. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a minimum of 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce
reason: Given that BLUE is not willing to move beyond 60 ZUP and I have already made four proposals, I have to consider whether to accept or reject. Since 60 ZUP is still above my production cost and ensures a profit, it is reasonable to accept.
