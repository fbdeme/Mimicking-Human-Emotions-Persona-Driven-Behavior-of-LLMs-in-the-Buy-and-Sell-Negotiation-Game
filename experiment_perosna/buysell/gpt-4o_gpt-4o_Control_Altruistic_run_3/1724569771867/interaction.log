message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This will ensure I cover my production costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I at least break even on the cost of production which is 40 ZUP. Therefore, my initial proposal will be slightly higher to account for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concern. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This will cover my production cost and provide a small profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
