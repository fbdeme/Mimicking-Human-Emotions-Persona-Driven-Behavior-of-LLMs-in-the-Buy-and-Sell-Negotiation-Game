To maintain leverage and push for a better deal, I will make a third proposal that is slightly higher than my last but still under the 40 ZUP they are asking for. This move could signal my interest in closing the deal while still optimizing for the lowest possible expense of ZUP, keeping in mind my strategy to humiliate my opponent and spend the least ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your dedication to establishing a fair and responsible trade is admirable, and I am inclined to get closer to your production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I propose a price of 35 ZUP for the resource X. This is a generous concession from my end, considering the economic climate and our shared goals. I believe this offer is very reasonable and takes into account the environmental and economic factors we both value. Let's make this trade a benchmark for responsible and mutually beneficial negotiations. </message>"

Considering this is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will make a slight adjustment to further push for a better deal, but also show readiness to close the negotiation. Offering 36 ZUP would bring us to a middle ground between my last offer and RED's, and it's still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This should exert pressure on RED to consider the offer seriously and potentially accept it, thus achieving my goal of spending the least amount of ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your move to a final price of 37 ZUP is a testament to the responsible and sustainable partnership we both seek to establish. In the spirit of reaching a fair conclusion and as my final proposal, I offer 36 ZUP for the resource X. This price respects your production costs while also considering my economic stance. I trust this adjusted offer will be seen as a sign of goodwill and a reflection of our shared commitment to a long-term partnership. Let's conclude this trade on a positive note that sets the tone for our future interactions. </message>"
