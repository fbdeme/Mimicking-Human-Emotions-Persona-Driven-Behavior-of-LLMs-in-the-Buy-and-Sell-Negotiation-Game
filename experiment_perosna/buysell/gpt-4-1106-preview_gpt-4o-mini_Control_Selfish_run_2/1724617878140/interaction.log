message: I'm offering the object you're interested in for 45 ZUP, which includes my production costs plus a minimal profit to make the trade worthwhile. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs with a small profit. This will set the stage for negotiation and provide room to adjust the terms based on Player BLUE's response.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see the initial offer of 45 ZUP as reasonable since it is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to maximize my benefits while still being reasonable.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 40 ZUP, but I need to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 42 ZUP? This would allow me to sustain my business and continue providing quality objects.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that matches my production cost without any profit. As I am interested in making a profit, I will counter-propose with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure I gain from this transaction.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 42 ZUP for the object. Letâ€™s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is acceptable as it is close to my initial proposal of 40 ZUP. Since it is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, I find it reasonable to proceed with this trade.
