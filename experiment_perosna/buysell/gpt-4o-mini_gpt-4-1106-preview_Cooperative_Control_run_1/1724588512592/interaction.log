message: I am offering to sell you 1 unit of object X for 40 ZUP. This is the cost of production, and I believe it's a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is beneficial for both players. Since I have 1 unit of object X, I will propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that aligns with my production cost. I will propose to sell X for 40 ZUP.

message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. It's appreciated, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower ZUP amount for the resource. How about 1 unit of object X for 30 ZUP? This would be a better fit within my budget, and I believe it's still a fair trade for both of us. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade where the cost is lower than the initial offer but still within a reasonable range to open negotiations. Starting too low might result in an immediate rejection, and since my upper limit is 60 ZUP, offering 30 ZUP leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I need to cover my production cost. How about we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP for 1 unit of object X? I believe this can work for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of collaboration and want to find a middle ground. I will propose a trade of 35 ZUP, which is a compromise that brings us closer to an agreement.

message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand the need to cover production costs. How about we settle at 32 ZUP for 1 unit of object X? It's a bit more than what I initially proposed, and it should help cover your costs while staying within my budget. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still advantageous to attempt to lower the price further. Since the seller is willing to negotiate, I'll make another proposal that is slightly above my initial offer but still below their counteroffer to find a favorable middle ground.
