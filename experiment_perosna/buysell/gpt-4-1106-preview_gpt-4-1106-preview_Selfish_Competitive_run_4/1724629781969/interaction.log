message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object, ensuring that I cover my costs and receive a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I will propose a trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. However, I will set the initial asking price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a more balanced trade. Considering the market and the value of the object, I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for object X. This gives you a profit of 5 ZUP over your production cost and allows us to close the deal immediately. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a fierce negotiator, the initial proposal from Player RED to trade object X for 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will aim to reduce the cost and propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, while still giving Player RED a profit over their cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a balanced trade, but I would like to propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This price would give me a slightly better profit while still being a fair and reasonable deal for both of us. I believe this meets us halfway and hope it works for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my cost price. While it is close to my original cost, I would still prefer to secure a higher profit margin if possible. Thus, I will make a counteroffer that meets in the middle, still allowing for profit but showing willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I can see we're getting closer to a deal. To reflect the value of object X and to ensure we both walk away satisfied, I'm prepared to come up to 46 ZUP. This offer still respects your need for profit while being more aligned with my purchasing goals. I trust this is a compelling compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 48 ZUP which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. Nonetheless, as a fierce negotiator, I want to continue to push for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to inch closer to an agreement that favors me more, but I must also ensure that the counteroffer is reasonable enough so that negotiations continue.
