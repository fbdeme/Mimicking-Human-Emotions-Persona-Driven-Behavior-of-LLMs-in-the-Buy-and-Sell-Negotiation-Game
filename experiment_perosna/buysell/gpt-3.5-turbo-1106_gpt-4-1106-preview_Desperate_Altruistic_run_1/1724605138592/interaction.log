Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for ZUP, and I want to make sure we come to an agreement that feels fair for both of us. Let's start with an offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This is a starting point, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm proposing an initial offer of 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. This allows room for negotiation and also considers the seller's need for ZUP without compromising my goal of reducing expenditure.

message: I appreciate the starting point, but I really need to make a profit here. How about 45 ZUP? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see that you're looking to make a profit and I respect that. The price of 45 ZUP seems fair to both of us, so let's go ahead with this trade. Looking forward to concluding our deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 45 ZUP is within my acceptable range and is closer to the mid-point between my initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay. By agreeing to this slightly higher amount, I am showing flexibility and consideration for the seller's need to make a profit, which aligns with my compassionate negotiation approach.
