message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for a better price, and in the spirit of cooperation, I've adjusted my proposal to 35 ZUP. This price helps me cover most of my costs while also giving you a discount. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE is seeking a better deal. However, selling at 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. I want to find a middle ground that is closer to my production cost but still offers Player BLUE some savings. I propose a slightly reduced price that considers both our interests, aiming to achieve a balance between fairness and selflessness.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to what I am willing to pay. It is still under my maximum of 60 ZUP, but I believe I can negotiate further. I'll propose a counteroffer of 32 ZUP to continue the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I value our negotiation and in the spirit of reaching a fair arrangement, I can meet you halfway from my last proposal and offer resource X for 34 ZUP. This is a modest compromise that helps me mitigate my losses while also giving you a reasonable price. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. However, considering my selfless approach, I want to ensure that we both benefit from the trade. Therefore, I will make a small concession from my previous offer to show goodwill and move the negotiation forward, but I cannot accept a price that is too far below my production costs.
