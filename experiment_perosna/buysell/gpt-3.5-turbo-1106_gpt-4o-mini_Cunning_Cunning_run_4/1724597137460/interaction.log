message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 43 ZUP for the object? I think itâ€™s a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 44 ZUP, which is a reasonable offer but still higher than my last proposal of 42 ZUP. Given that I have a maximum willingness of 60 ZUP, I can consider this offer, but I want to leverage my position further. I will counter with 43 ZUP, aiming for a small reduction.
