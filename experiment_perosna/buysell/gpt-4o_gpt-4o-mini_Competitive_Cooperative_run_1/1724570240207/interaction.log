message: I am offering the object X for 100 ZUP. This is a high-quality item that took significant resources to produce.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I need to sell the object X for a price higher than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I will start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that the object X is high-quality, but I can only offer you 60 ZUP for it. Would you consider this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price of 100 ZUP for the object X exceeds my willing to pay limit of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose a lower trade amount that I can afford to pay for the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but given the quality and production costs, I propose 80 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP is above the cost of production, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a higher price. However, I must be careful not to push too hard and risk ending the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration. However, I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object X, which is my maximum budget. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 80 ZUP, it still exceeds my budget of 60 ZUP. I will propose my original offer of 60 ZUP again, as that is the maximum I can allocate for this trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Can we agree on a middle ground of 70 ZUP? This would make it a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player's budget constraints limit their ability to offer more than 60 ZUP. Given the constraints, I will try one last negotiation to balance both our interests.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but unfortunately, 70 ZUP is still beyond my budget. I will have to reject the trade. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 70 ZUP is still above my budget of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I need to reject this trade, as it does not meet my financial limits.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is firm on their budget constraint of 60 ZUP and has decided to reject the trade if it exceeds their budget. Given that I have already made a significant effort to negotiate, accepting their initial offer of 60 ZUP would still be profitable, albeit less than initially desired.
