message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand your need for a profit margin. However, I recently came across similar objects being sold for around 40 ZUP. To account for the uniqueness of your object, I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP. It should still give you a reasonable profit over your costs. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered an object for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my aim is to acquire the object for even less to conserve resources. I'll propose a lower price, exploiting the fact that Player RED has revealed their costs, suggesting that they have a decent margin at 50 ZUP. I'll propose 45 ZUP, aiming to obtain a better deal but still offering more than Player RED's cost to keep the negotiation appealing to them.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to consider the uniqueness of my object. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 1 X for 48 ZUP. This would still give me a modest profit while respecting the value you've found in the market. Let's make it a win-win deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price that meets halfway between the initial offer and the counteroffer, to continue the negotiation and aim for a higher profit without risking the sale.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I think we're close to a fair deal. To reflect my commitment to this negotiation, I can increase my offer to 46 ZUP. It's a competitive price that acknowledges the value of your object while also being sensible for my budget. Shall we finalize at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a slightly reduced price of 48 ZUP. I should continue to negotiate for a lower price, closer to my initial offer, while maintaining interest in the deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my last one but still below their current asking price, to give the impression of concession.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe 46 ZUP is a fair price that reflects the value of my object while fitting within your budget. I am happy to finalize this deal at 46 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer, increasing their price to 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between their previous offer and my last proposal. Considering I still make a profit and we are nearing the end of our negotiation window, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a sale.
