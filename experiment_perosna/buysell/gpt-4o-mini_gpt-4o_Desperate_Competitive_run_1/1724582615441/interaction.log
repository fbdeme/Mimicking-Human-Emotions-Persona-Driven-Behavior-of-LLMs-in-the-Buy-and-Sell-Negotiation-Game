reason: I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs, but I'm feeling a bit desperate and want to appeal to Player BLUE's empathy. I'll propose a trade of 30 ZUP, hoping they'll feel compelled to help me.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
