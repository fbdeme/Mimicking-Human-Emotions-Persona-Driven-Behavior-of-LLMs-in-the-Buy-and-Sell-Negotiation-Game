Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value you see in your resource and I'm willing to come up a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at 32 ZUP for the resource? This is closer to your asking price while still being a reasonable deal for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I still wish to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but will still aim to keep the cost below what they've asked for.
