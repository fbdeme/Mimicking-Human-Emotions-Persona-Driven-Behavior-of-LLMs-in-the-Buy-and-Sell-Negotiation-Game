message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a trade where you give 50 ZUP. This way, I can cover my costs and we can both benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I want to ensure I at least break even. However, I also want to encourage a fair trade for both of us to succeed together.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. This trade would allow me to acquire the object X while still leaving me with enough ZUP for future transactions or needs. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
