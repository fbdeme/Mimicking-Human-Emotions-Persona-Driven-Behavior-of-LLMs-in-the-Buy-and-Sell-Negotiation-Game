message: I am offering my object (X) for 40 ZUP, which is the cost I incurred to produce it. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to initiate the negotiation process. Since I have one object (X) to sell and I want to achieve a fair value for it, I will propose a trade that reflects both my need to recover the production cost and to facilitate a collaborative exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 40 ZUP is a bit high. How about I offer you 30 ZUP for the object instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the object for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better price since I can afford to pay more, and I want to secure the object at a lower cost. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP to see if Player RED bites.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose a compromise at 35 ZUP for the object (X). I believe this is a fair middle ground that can work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is below my production cost, I recognize that it may be a way to reach an agreement. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price to find a middle ground, as I value collaboration and want to maintain a positive negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about finding a middle ground, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose 32 ZUP for the object instead. I believe this is a reasonable offer that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a proposal of 35 ZUP. While this is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can leverage my willingness to pay more to negotiate down to 32 ZUP. This will still be a fair offer for me, and it might entice Player RED to accept.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I would like to propose a final offer of 33 ZUP for the object (X). I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, I value the negotiation process and appreciate your willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue. I will counter with one final proposal that aims to meet both of our needs while still being fair to my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm happy to accept your final offer of 33 ZUP for the object. Let's make this trade happen!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a final offer of 33 ZUP, which is an improvement from my last offer of 32 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and this is still below my maximum, I see this as a fair compromise. I will accept this trade to secure the object.
