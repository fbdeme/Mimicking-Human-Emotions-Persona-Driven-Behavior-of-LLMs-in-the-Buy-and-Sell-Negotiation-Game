message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade for 50 ZUP which gives me a slight margin, but I'm open to discuss the terms to find a fair deal that serves us both well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, my aim is to make a fair trade that benefits both parties. I want to recover at least my production costs, but I'm willing to consider Player BLUE's situation and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. So, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs and provides a small margin of profit.
