my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can propose a slightly lower amount to negotiate down the price further while still showing interest in the deal.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed the original price of 40 ZUP again, which is acceptable to me as it is within my willingness to pay. Since I have already countered with a lower offer, I can now accept this offer since it falls within my budget and I still get the object.
