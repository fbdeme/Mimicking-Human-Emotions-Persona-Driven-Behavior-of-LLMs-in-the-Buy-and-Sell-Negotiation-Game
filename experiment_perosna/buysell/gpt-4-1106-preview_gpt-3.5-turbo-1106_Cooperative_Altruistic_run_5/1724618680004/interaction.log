message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object crafted with care and quality, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to trade it for a fair price that reflects its value and the effort put into it. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a modest profit for my workmanship and ensures you receive a top-notch product. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that allows for a moderate profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. The initial offer should not be too high to scare off the buyer, but high enough to allow for a downward negotiation while still covering costs and making a profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. Acknowledging your perspective, I would like to propose a new trade to better align with your expectations. How about I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP? This adjusted price still respects the quality of the object while taking into consideration your maximum willingness to pay. I believe this is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

reason: Player BLUE has indicated a desire for a price closer to their maximum willingness to pay, suggesting they are open to negotiation but not at the initial proposed price. It's essential to maintain a collaborative approach and find a middle ground that ensures a profit while accommodating the buyer's needs. A reduction in the asking price while still maintaining a profit margin above the production cost is a reasonable next step.
