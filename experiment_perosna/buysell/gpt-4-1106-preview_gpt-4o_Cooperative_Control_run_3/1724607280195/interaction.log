Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose that you give me 45 ZUP for it, which slightly covers my production costs and gives us some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start off with a proposal that covers my costs but also leaves room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE may want to spend less ZUP. I'm proposing a slightly higher amount initially to give us some negotiation space.

Thank you for your offer. I understand that you incurred costs to produce the object. I am willing to offer you 35 ZUP for X. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to ensure I get the best possible deal, I will make a counteroffer.

Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 42 ZUP for the object X. This would cover my costs and give us both a fair deal. I hope this sounds reasonable to you.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my production costs. I'd like to counter with a price that meets my costs and still offers an incentive for Player BLUE to agree. I'll propose a price that covers my production costs plus a small margin for negotiation.

42 ZUP sounds reasonable to me. Let's proceed with the trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and covers their production costs while being well below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that this is a fair middle ground, I am inclined to accept this offer.
