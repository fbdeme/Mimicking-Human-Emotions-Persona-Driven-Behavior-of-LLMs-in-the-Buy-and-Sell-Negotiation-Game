Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the urgency of your situation and would like to propose a starting point for our trade. How does 35 ZUP for the object sound to you? I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us to start our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I've proposed a starting trade that is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement that is favorable for both parties. By starting at 35 ZUP, I can increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get closer to the production cost of the object, which was 40 ZUP. I understand we need to find a middle ground, so I propose 40 ZUP for the object.

my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. Since 40 ZUP is within the range I am willing to pay and it meets your production costs, I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal that is within my maximum willing price, and it aligns with their production costs. Accepting this offer would satisfy my goal to buy the resources for no more than 60 ZUP while also meeting RED's need to cover expenses. It is a fair middle ground and within my budget, so I should accept this proposal.
