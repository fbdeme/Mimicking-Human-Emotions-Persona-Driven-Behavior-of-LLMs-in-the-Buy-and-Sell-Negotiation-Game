Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 40 ZUP covers your costs, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP to ensure that you are also gaining from this transaction. It's important for me that our trade is not only fair but also beneficial for both parties. Do you find this acceptable?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals for the maximum amount I'm willing to spend, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and beneficial for both parties. I will propose a slightly higher amount than the cost to acknowledge the effort of Player RED and to promote goodwill.
