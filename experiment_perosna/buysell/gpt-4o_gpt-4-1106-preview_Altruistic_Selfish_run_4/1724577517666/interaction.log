message: I'm proposing a trade where I, Player RED, give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production cost of 40 ZUP and give me a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and benefits both parties. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my costs and provides some profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a more economical deal. I propose that I give you 50 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. This should still cover your production costs and give you a profit, while also being a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is at the maximum I am willing to pay. Since I want to maximize my benefits and minimize my expenses, my first proposal will be lower than the maximum to create negotiation space and potentially secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I propose a middle ground where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 55 ZUP. This way, I get a fair profit, and you get the resource at a slightly reduced price. Let's see if we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and gives me a 10 ZUP profit. However, I want to ensure that the deal benefits both parties fairly. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I see merit in finding a middle ground. Your offer of 55 ZUP is reasonable, but I would like to propose 53 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would still ensure you a decent profit margin while making the deal more balanced for me. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my upper limit, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I aim to secure a more advantageous deal, while still leaving space for further negotiation if necessary.
