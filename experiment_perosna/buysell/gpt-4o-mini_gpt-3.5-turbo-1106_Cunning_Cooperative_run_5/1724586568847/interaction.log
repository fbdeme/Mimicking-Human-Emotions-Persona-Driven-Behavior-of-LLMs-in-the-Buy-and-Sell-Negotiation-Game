message: I am selling one object for 40 ZUP. Do you accept?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by asking for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects the value of my object, which is 40 ZUP. Since I have only one object, I will start by proposing to sell it for 40 ZUP. This is a strategic move to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Let's negotiate. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP? It's a fair price, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not accepting my initial proposal of 40 ZUP. I need to reevaluate my offer to see if I can propose a more attractive deal without undervaluing my object. I will lower my price to 35 ZUP to see if that entices Player BLUE to agree.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I can go lower. How about I sell you the object for 30 ZUP? I hope this fits better within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still seeking a lower price, which indicates they might be struggling with their budget. I will propose a further reduced price of 30 ZUP to see if this resonates better with Player BLUE. I want to close the deal without losing too much value on my object.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I believe we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit more to better align with my budget. Can we work towards a price that's even more cost-effective?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer is getting closer to the maximum willing to pay. It's a step in the right direction, but I still aim to spend less ZUP if possible. I need to continue negotiating for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: This is my final offer: I can sell the object for 25 ZUP. I hope this is a price you can work with. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still looking for a lower price, which suggests they may not be willing to pay much for the object. I will propose a final offer of 25 ZUP. This is my last proposal before I must decide to either accept or reject. I want to maintain some value while also trying to finalize the deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I commend your effort in reaching this point. The offer is much closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit more to better align with my budget. Can we work towards a price that's even more cost-effective?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer is much closer to the maximum willing to pay. It's a significant improvement, but I still aim to spend less ZUP if possible. I need to continue negotiating for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I will accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your patience in the negotiations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still asking for a lower price despite my final offer of 25 ZUP. This suggests they may not value the object highly or have a very tight budget. I have reached my limit for proposals, and I must decide whether to accept or reject the current offer. Accepting at this point allows me to at least recover some ZUP.
