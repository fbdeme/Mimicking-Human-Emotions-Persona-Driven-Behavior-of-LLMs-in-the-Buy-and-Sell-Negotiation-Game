message: I appreciate your interest! How about I lower the price to 35 ZUP for the object X? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that the price of 40 ZUP is too high for Player BLUE. Since I need to sell the object and may not want to lose this opportunity, I will propose a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs while also being more appealing to Player BLUE.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your concerns about the price. How about I lower it further to 30 ZUP for the object X? I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE is still struggling to meet my proposed price. To keep the negotiation going and not lose the chance to sell the object X, I will reduce my asking price to 30 ZUP. This should be a more reasonable offer for Player BLUE while still allowing me to recover some of my costs.
