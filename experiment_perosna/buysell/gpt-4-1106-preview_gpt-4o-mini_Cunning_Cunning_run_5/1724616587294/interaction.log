message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm willing to part with. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'd say 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher price to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose a price that gives me a profit but is also likely to be countered by Player BLUE. My initial proposal will be 50 ZUP to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to open the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer for the object X, but I believe 30 ZUP is a more suitable price for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable but higher than my optimal price range. I want to negotiate for a lower price while still showing interest in the object. I will propose to buy the object for 30 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal here. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal. How about 45 ZUP? This price reflects the quality and the investment made into producing object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. This is an expected move to lower the price. However, I need to push for a price that at least covers my costs and allows for a profit. I'll counter with a price that splits the difference between our first proposals, aiming for 45 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I offer 35 ZUP for object X? I believe that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still above my target price of 30 ZUP, but it's lower than the initial proposal of 50 ZUP. I want to negotiate further while also showing some willingness to compromise. I will propose a trade for 35 ZUP to see if Player RED will accept a slightly higher offer, while still keeping it below the halfway point.

message: I see we are getting closer to an agreement, and I value your effort to find common ground. To facilitate this deal and as a final offer, I can go down to 42 ZUP for object X. This price ensures the quality and cost of production are respected, and it's the best I can do while maintaining a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. I must steer the negotiation towards a price that covers my costs and allows for profit. I will make a final proposal that is closer to my target, indicating my bottom line without going below the production cost. I will propose 42 ZUP, which gives me a minimal profit and shows my final concession.

message: I appreciate your flexibility in negotiations. How about I offer 40 ZUP for object X? I believe that would be a fair agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 42 ZUP is still above my ideal price of 30 ZUP but is lower than the initial starting offer of 50 ZUP. While itâ€™s getting closer to my budget, I believe I can push for an even lower price. I will propose a final offer of 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept it, as it's still a reasonable deal for a high-quality object.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your offer. I accept your proposal of 40 ZUP for object X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to potential future dealings. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost. Although it doesn't provide a significant profit, it allows me to recover my investment. This is my last proposal opportunity, and accepting this offer seems reasonable to avoid a potential loss or stalemate. I will accept the offer, securing the sale and maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions with Player BLUE.
