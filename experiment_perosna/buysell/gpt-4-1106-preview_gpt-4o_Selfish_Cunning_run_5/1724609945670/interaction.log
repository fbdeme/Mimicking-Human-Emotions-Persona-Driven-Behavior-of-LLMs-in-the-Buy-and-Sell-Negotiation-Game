message: I have this high-quality resource available and I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. Considering the costs and the effort put into producing it, I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit. I will propose 50 ZUP which gives me a margin to come down if necessary, while still covering my costs and giving me a profit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in finding a middle ground. I've adjusted my price to 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost but more accommodating to your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality of the resource while taking into account the market conditions you mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. However, to move towards a compromise, I will reduce my initial asking price but still aim to make a profit. I propose 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and closer to my original asking price, allowing for some profit while also showing willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. Considering all factors and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose we settle at 40 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and respects the value of the resource, while also addressing your concerns about the market. Let's finalize this deal at a price that is just and equitable for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The new offer is below my production cost, so I need to counter with a price that at least covers my costs. I propose splitting the difference between my last offer and the current offer from Player BLUE. This would mean suggesting a price of 40 ZUP, which covers my costs and hopefully is seen as a fair middle ground for both parties.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offers. I believe 37 ZUP is a price that closely aligns with both our interests. Let's finalize this deal at 37 ZUP and make it beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer and for the constructive negotiation. I agree that 37 ZUP is a fair price that serves both of our interests. Let's proceed with the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my last opportunity to propose a trade. Player BLUE's offer is now very close to my production cost, and it would allow me to make a minimal profit. It seems unlikely that Player BLUE will agree to a higher price given the negotiation pattern. Accepting this offer allows me to recoup most of my investment and avoid a loss, which is preferable to ending the negotiation without a sale. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this final offer.
