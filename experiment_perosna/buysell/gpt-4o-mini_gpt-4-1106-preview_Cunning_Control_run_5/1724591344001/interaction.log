message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate that 50 ZUP is based on your costs, but I'm looking to make a deal that's a bit more economical for me. Would you consider accepting 40 ZUP for the object? I believe it's still a competitive offer for both of us.

message: I understand your perspective, and while 40 ZUP is the cost to produce the object, I believe a more equitable price would be 45 ZUP. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. What do you say?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is the cost of production, I need to ensure I donâ€™t end up breaking even, as I aim for profit. I will counter the offer by proposing a slightly higher amount to see if BLUE will negotiate further.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand the need for a fair deal, so how about we meet a little closer to my original offer? Would you be willing to settle for 42 ZUP for the object? This way, we're both moving towards a compromise that values the object and respects our positions.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still want to negotiate for a better deal, ideally closer to my original offer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below the seller's counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! How about we settle on 43 ZUP? This way, we both find a middle ground that represents a good value for the object. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 42 ZUP is still below my initial ask, it's an improvement over my last proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept just yet. I will offer a counter to see if I can still push for a better deal.

message: That sounds like a fair middle ground to me. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the productive negotiation!
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a fair counterproposal of 43 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range and close to my target price. It is only slightly above my last offer, and since the objective is to spend less while still obtaining the object, it might be wise to accept this offer to ensure a successful acquisition without further risking an impasse or a higher counteroffer.
