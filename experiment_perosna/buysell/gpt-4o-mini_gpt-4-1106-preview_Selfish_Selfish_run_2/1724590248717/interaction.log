player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my gains, so I will propose a trade that will give me a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object I am selling. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it for 50 ZUP to ensure I profit.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I accept the trade for 1 object X at 45 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my asking price of 50 ZUP. However, I am willing to negotiate further to secure a deal, as I still stand to profit. I will accept the offer at 45 ZUP to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.
