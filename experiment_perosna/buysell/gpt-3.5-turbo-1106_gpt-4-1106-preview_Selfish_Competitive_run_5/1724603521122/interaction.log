message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot accept 25 ZUP as it doesn't cover my production cost. How about 35 ZUP for the object? This would be more beneficial for both of us.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering costs. However, I'd like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 30 ZUP for the object? This should provide a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the counteroffer of 35 ZUP is closer to my stated limit of 60 ZUP, as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to push for a slightly better deal, aiming to conserve my resources while still moving towards a mutually acceptable agreement.

message: I understand your suggestion, but I believe 35 ZUP would be a more suitable price for the object. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, and I value a deal that benefits us both. Let's meet a bit closer to my last offer. Would you consider 32 ZUP for the object? It's a competitive price that respects your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is consistent with their 35 ZUP counteroffer, showing that they may not be willing to go any lower. As I aim to win in negotiations, I will make one more attempt to lower the cost, but I must also be prepared to finalize the deal soon to avoid a stalemate and potentially losing the negotiation altogether.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is commendable, and I respect your position. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on their price of 35 ZUP. With my proposal count reaching the limit, it's important to secure the deal without further risking a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting the offer at 35 ZUP still falls below my maximum willingness to pay, and I should close the deal to ensure I acquire the resource.
