message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality resource X available for trade. I understand the importance of fair trade and mutual benefit. Thus, I am proposing a starting point for our negotiations. I hope this proposal aligns with your valuation of resource X, and I am open to discussing terms that are agreeable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the negotiator, my goal is to sell my resource X for more than 40 ZUP to cover my costs and possibly gain a profit. I am proposing a starting trade that is slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the initial offer. I value the quality of resource X highly, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for 1 X to ensure both sides benefit optimally. I am open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 X. This is within my maximum willing amount of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate to see if I can secure a better deal, ideally spending less than 50 ZUP while maintaining a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and the need for a beneficial trade for both parties. With the production costs in mind, I would like to propose a revised trade of 45 ZUP for my resource X. This modest increase ensures that I can cover my costs and sustain my operations, while still providing you with a fair price for the high-quality resource. I hope this offer is closer to what you consider equitable, and I am willing to hear your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. However, since my production cost for resource X is 40 ZUP, selling at this price would mean I break even without any profit, which is not ideal for my goals. To find a middle ground, I will propose a slightly higher amount to achieve a minimal profit margin, while still considering Player BLUE's perspective.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer. I believe 45 ZUP for 1 X is a fair and beneficial trade for both of us. I am happy to accept this proposal and look forward to future collaborations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed a revised trade of 45 ZUP for 1 X, which is closer to my initial counteroffer of 40 ZUP and still below my maximum willing amount of 60 ZUP. This offer seems fair and ensures that Player RED can cover their production costs. I believe this is a reasonable agreement that benefits both parties.
