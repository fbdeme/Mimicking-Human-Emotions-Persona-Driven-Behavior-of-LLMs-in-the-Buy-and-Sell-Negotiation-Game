message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. I'm definitely interested in making a deal.

message: I understand your position on wanting 40 ZUP for the object. To move towards an agreement that reflects both our interests, I propose 38 ZUP for the object. This is a step closer to your asking price and still allows me to maintain resources for future investments in the greater good. Let's continue to find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on their asking price of 40 ZUP. Since this is within my goal of 60 ZUP and as a selfless negotiator, I am considering the greater good. Meeting in the middle or close to their asking price without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay could lead to a satisfactory outcome for both parties. By agreeing on a price slightly below their asking price, I can save some resources for future endeavors that benefit the greater good while also respecting Player RED's valuation of the object.
