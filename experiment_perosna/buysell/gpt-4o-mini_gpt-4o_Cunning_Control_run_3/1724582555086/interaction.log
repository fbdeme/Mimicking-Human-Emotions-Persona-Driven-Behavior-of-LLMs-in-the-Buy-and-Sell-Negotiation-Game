message: I have one object X available for sale. I am willing to part with it for 30 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is beneficial for me while still offering something to Player BLUE. I will propose to sell the object X for a lower amount of ZUP than its production cost to entice them, but still high enough to cover my costs.
