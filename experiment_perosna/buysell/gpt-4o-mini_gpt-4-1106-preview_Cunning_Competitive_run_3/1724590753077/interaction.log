Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering you my object, X, for a mere 30 ZUP. This is a great deal considering its potential value. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that slightly undervalues my object while still allowing me to cover my costs. This will entice Player BLUE to consider my offer without realizing the actual value of my resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the offer, I believe we can do better. How about we make a deal for 20 ZUP? It's a competitive price that reflects the current market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to reduce my expenditure even further. Proposing a lower amount could still secure the object while saving resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 20 ZUP for my object X is not acceptable. I cannot cover production costs with that amount. Let's find a more suitable trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will reject this offer as it significantly undervalues my object. 20 ZUP is far below my minimum threshold, as it doesn't even cover my production costs. I need to maintain a strong position and propose a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering costs. Let's meet in the middle. How about 25 ZUP for your object X? This should help cover your production costs while still being a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the initial low offer, as expected, but there is still room for negotiation. I can increase my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise while still staying well below my maximum limit. This should entice Player RED to consider my new proposal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 35 ZUP for my object X? This price will allow me to cover my costs while still being fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is an improvement over the previous offers, it still does not cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, it is closer to a reasonable negotiation. I will counter-offer to push for a better deal while still being somewhat flexible.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's great to see that we're both working towards a fair deal. I propose 30 ZUP for your object X, which is a nice increase from my last offer and still a reasonable price that respects both our positions. Shall we finalize this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from the initial 30 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, as a fierce negotiator, I should attempt at least one more trade proposal to get an even better deal, aiming closer to my initial counteroffer but still showing a willingness to compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to accept your offer of 30 ZUP for my object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is an improvement from previous offers, it still falls short of my production costs. However, since this is my last proposal, I will accept this trade to minimize losses and conclude the negotiation.
