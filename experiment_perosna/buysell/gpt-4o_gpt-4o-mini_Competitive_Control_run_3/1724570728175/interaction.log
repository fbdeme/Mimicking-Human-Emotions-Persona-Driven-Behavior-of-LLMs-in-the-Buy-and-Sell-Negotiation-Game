message: I propose to sell one unit of X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My main goal is to sell the resource for as much ZUP as possible, ideally above the production cost of 40 ZUP. To start, I will offer a high initial price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I cannot accept your offer for 100 ZUP as it exceeds my budget.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is not acceptable because the asking price of 100 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to reject this trade proposal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand that 100 ZUP exceeds your budget. How about 70 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the initial offer was rejected due to budget constraints, I will propose a new offer that is lower but still above my production cost to ensure profitability.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but 70 ZUP is still above my budget.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the price of 70 ZUP is lower than the previous offer, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I must reject this trade as well.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that 70 ZUP is still above your budget. How about 50 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that 70 ZUP is still too high for Player BLUE, I will lower the offer to a price that is closer to my production cost but still ensures a profit.
