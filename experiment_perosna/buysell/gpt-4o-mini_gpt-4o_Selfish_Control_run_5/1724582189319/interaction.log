my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have 1 object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to sell this object at a profit. I will propose selling the object for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price and allows for a small profit margin.
