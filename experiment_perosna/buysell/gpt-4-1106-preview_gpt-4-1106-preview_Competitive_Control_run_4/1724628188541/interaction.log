message: Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I have a high-quality resource that will surely meet your needs. I propose an exchange where I give you 1 unit of resource X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a high initial price to give room for negotiation, with the aim of asserting dominance in the negotiation and getting as close as possible to or above my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price that might be more mutually beneficial and leaves room for further collaboration in the future. How about I give you 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum willing to pay threshold. It would be better to negotiate a lower price to save some ZUP while still acquiring the needed resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a more agreeable price, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 55 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price reflects the quality of the resource and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but I want to push for a higher price to maximize profit and establish a strong negotiating position. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial price but still above my production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal. I believe we are close to a fair agreement. I propose 53 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer is a bit more than my initial proposal and might be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to our maximum willingness to pay, but it is still advantageous to attempt to lower the cost further. Since there is a willingness to negotiate, proposing a slightly higher amount than our previous offer but still less than 55 ZUP could result in a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see that we are converging towards an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to your offer: 54 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price takes into account the value of the resource and also our interest in a fair and beneficial deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest counteroffer is still profitable for me, but I want to try to assert a bit more dominance and aim for a slightly higher price. I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal, but I must also be prepared to close the deal soon to avoid risking a breakdown in negotiations.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and recognize the value of the resource you are offering. In the spirit of reaching a fair deal, I would like to counter with 52 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This keeps us both below the maximum threshold we set and allows us to establish a good foundation for potential future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is only 1 ZUP away from our last proposal. Given that we are still under our maximum willingness to pay, it might be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed favorably for both parties without risking a breakdown in negotiations. However, we could attempt one final negotiation to see if we can save that small margin, keeping in mind we have one last proposal after this if required.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and see the importance of establishing a good relationship for future transactions. Therefore, I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's finalize this deal and look forward to more opportunities to work together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 52 ZUP is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit, although less than desired. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a counteroffer, I will accept this deal to ensure a positive outcome and avoid the risk of the deal falling through. This acceptance also allows for the possibility of future transactions with this buyer.
