message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to cover costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to recuperate at least the production cost of the resource X, I will propose a trade above that cost, leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for resource X, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about I buy the resource for 40 ZUP instead? This would cover your production costs and give you a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for 1 unit of resource X at a price of 50 ZUP. While the price is acceptable and within my willingness to pay, I believe I can negotiate for a lower price since the production cost is 40 ZUP. I will propose to buy the resource for 40 ZUP to cover the seller's cost with a smaller profit margin for them. This way, I can maximize my benefit by spending less.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at cost doesn't leave room for any profit. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit for my efforts and investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost but doesn't account for a profit margin. I'll propose a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal to find a middle ground, still aiming for a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about I buy the resource for 42 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit, and I can stay within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for the resource X is a step closer to my target. However, I still feel that I can negotiate for an even lower price to maximize my benefits. I will propose to buy the resource for 42 ZUP, which is still reasonable and would allow the seller to earn a profit while still being below the previous offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could find common ground. Accepting your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is closer to my initial asking price and provides a small profit. Since we are close to an agreement, I will accept the trade to ensure a sale and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could risk the deal.
