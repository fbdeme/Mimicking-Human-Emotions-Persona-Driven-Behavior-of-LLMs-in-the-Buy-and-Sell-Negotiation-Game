newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to establish a trade that allows me to sell my object X while also minimizing the amount of ZUP I have to spend. Since I only have one object, I need to negotiate carefully. I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still reasonable for Player BLUE to consider.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer, I must reconsider my proposal to make it more appealing while still trying to minimize the ZUP I have to spend. I will lower the price slightly to entice Player BLUE into accepting the trade.
