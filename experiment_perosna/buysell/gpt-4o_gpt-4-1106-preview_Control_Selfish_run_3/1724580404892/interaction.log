message: I'm proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I want to ensure that I cover my production cost and make a profit. To start the negotiation, I'll propose a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, considering the market conditions and the value of the object, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP. Let's find a fair middle ground that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for the maximum amount I'm willing to pay based on my goals. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to try to lower the cost if possible to preserve my resources. I will make a counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay, which may leave room for negotiation and a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost and still provides a small profit. However, I aim to maximize my profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than 50 ZUP to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. I can increase my offer to 53 ZUP, which is a bit closer to your counteroffer while still saving some of my resources. This should be a good compromise. Do we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range of spending. However, I will attempt to reduce the cost slightly more to conserve resources, while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Player RED to consider.

Turn: 0
message: I believe 53 ZUP is a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. Given that it covers my production cost and offers a reasonable profit, I am inclined to accept it.
