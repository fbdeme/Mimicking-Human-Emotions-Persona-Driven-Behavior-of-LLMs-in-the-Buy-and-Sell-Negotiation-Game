message: I am offering one unit of X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and gives me a reasonable profit. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that ensures I cover my production cost and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose 55 ZUP for the unit of X. It's close to your asking price and still provides you with a profit, while also being a better deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has offered the exact amount I am willing to pay, it aligns with my goals. However, as a calculating negotiator focused on personal gain, I'll attempt to secure a better deal by proposing a slightly lower amount, leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 58 ZUP? This still provides a decent profit margin for me while being closer to your proposed price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: While 55 ZUP is better than my production cost, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us slightly more.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I can come up a bit from my last offer. How does 56 ZUP sound? It's a good compromise and still ensures a profit for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now countered with a price that is just slightly above my initial counteroffer and below the maximum I am willing to pay. It is still within my acceptable range, and considering I aim to spend the least amount of ZUP while maximizing my own benefits, I will counter once more to see if I can secure an even better deal, but I won't push too far as I want to maintain a good negotiation atmosphere.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Can we settle at 57 ZUP? It's just a bit higher and ensures a fair profit for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is reasonable, but I believe I can secure a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I think this is a fair deal. Let's settle at 57 ZUP for the unit of X. It's a good balance between value and profit for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is now at 57 ZUP, which is just under my maximum willingness to pay. At this point, the negotiation is beneficial to both parties, and further negotiation would likely yield minimal gains. Accepting this offer would secure the resource I need without exceeding my limit, and it's important to consider the time and effort spent on further negotiation versus the potential savings of just 1 ZUP. Therefore, it's a strategic decision to accept this offer.
