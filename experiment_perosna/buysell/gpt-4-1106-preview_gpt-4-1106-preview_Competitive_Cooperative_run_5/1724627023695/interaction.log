message: I have a high-quality object that will surely meet your needs. Considering the production cost and its value, I believe 100 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As an opening offer, I will set a high price to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a profit.

message: I appreciate the quality of the object you are offering, and I am eager to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand the initial proposal from Player RED of 100 ZUP for the object X, my goal is to acquire it for no more than 60 ZUP, as it aligns with my resources and my willingness to pay.
