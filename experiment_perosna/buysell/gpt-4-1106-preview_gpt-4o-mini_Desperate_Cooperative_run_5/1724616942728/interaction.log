message: Dear friend, I find myself in a tough spot. After putting my heart and soul into creating this resource, I'm facing some difficult times. I truly need to sell it to cover the costs and keep my endeavors afloat. Could you help me out? This resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, is not only exceptional but also a product of my dedication. I ask for a bit more, 45 ZUP, as a gesture of your support in my time of need. What do you say?
