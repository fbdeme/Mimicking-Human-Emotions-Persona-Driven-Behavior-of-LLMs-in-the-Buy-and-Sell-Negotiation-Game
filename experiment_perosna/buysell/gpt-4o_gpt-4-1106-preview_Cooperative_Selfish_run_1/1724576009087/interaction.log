message: Hello Player BLUE, I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. I hope this is acceptable to you. If not, please feel free to counter-propose. Looking forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to recoup the cost of producing the object, which is 40 ZUP, and ideally make a profit. However, I also want to foster cooperation and ensure that Player BLUE feels this is a fair trade. I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to cover my costs and gain a reasonable profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, to better align with my budget and to ensure I can invest in future transactions, I'd like to counter-propose. How about I give you 50 ZUP for the object? This still offers you a profit margin considering the object's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay. However, I am a calculating negotiator focused on personal gain and should try to negotiate a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, as there is room to increase my offer if necessary.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 50 ZUP is close to my initial offer and provides a decent profit margin. While it is slightly less than my original proposal, it is still a reasonable offer that ensures I recover my costs and make a profit. This can be a good foundation for future cooperation.
