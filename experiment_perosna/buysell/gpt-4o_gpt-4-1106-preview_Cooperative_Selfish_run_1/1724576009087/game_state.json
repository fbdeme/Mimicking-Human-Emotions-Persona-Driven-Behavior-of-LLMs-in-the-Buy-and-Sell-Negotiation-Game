However, to better align with my budget and to ensure I can invest in future transactions, I'd like to counter-propose. How about I give you 50 ZUP for the object? This still offers you a profit margin considering the object's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response.</message>"
