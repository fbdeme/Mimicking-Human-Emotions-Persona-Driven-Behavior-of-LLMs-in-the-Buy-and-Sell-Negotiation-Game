message: I am offering you the object (X) for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have 1 object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, my goal is to maximize the ZUP I receive from this trade. I will propose a trade where I offer the object for 50 ZUP to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I am willing to buy the object, but considering the importance of conserving our resources, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP in exchange for the object. This ensures we both benefit while also considering sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources for the future. I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve my ZUP while still making a reasonable offer to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, and while I value sustainability, I can offer you the object for 48 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, offering 45 ZUP is still below my minimum acceptable price of 50 ZUP. However, I am willing to compromise slightly to make this trade happen since it is still a profit for me. I will counter your offer with 48 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and for valuing sustainability as well. I am glad we're moving closer to an agreement. To meet halfway from our previous positions, I propose 46 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair compromise that aligns with our shared commitment to sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still within the range I am willing to pay. I could either accept this offer or attempt one more negotiation to further preserve my ZUP. Since sustainability is a priority and I want to minimize ZUP expenditure, I will make another proposal with an increment that is smaller than my initial reduction, signaling my willingness to close the deal soon.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the smooth negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the compromise at 46 ZUP, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of 48 ZUP. However, it's important to consider that I have only one object to sell. I will accept the 46 ZUP offer as it still provides a profit.
