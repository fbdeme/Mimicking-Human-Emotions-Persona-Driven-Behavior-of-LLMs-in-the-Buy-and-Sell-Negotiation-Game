message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to trade my object X for 45 ZUP. This price slightly exceeds my production cost, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that meets both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to propose a fair trade that would cover my costs but also consider the position of Player BLUE. I'll start by proposing a trade that asks for slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE may have constraints as well.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 45 ZUP is a bit high for object X. How about I offer you 30 ZUP instead? Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will counter the proposal with a lower offer, as I want to secure the object X while minimizing my spending. I will propose 30 ZUP, which is significantly less than the initial offer, and see how Player RED reacts.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your concerns about the price. I've reduced my asking price to 42 ZUP, which is just above my production costs. This modest increase ensures that I cover my costs while still offering you a fair price. I hope this is a reasonable middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 30 ZUP by Player BLUE is below my production cost, and as a compassionate negotiator, I need to cover my costs at a minimum. However, I also want to work towards a deal that is agreeable to both parties. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down from my initial proposal, but not below the production cost. I believe a slight profit is fair for sustainability.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your new offer of 42 ZUP. However, I believe I can only go up to 35 ZUP for object X. Would you be willing to consider this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 42 ZUP is better than the previous one, it's still higher than I am willing to pay. I will counter with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is more reasonable for me while still being a fair trade for Player RED. This may entice them to accept my offer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you have a maximum you're willing to pay. As a compassionate negotiator, I want us to reach an agreement that is fair for both sides. My final proposal is for 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This ensures I don't incur a loss, and you receive the object X at a fair price. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 35 ZUP is still below my production costs. While I want to be compassionate and reach a compromise, I cannot sell at a loss. I should make a final proposal that meets my minimum cost but also shows a willingness to negotiate. To demonstrate flexibility, I will propose a number that is at my break-even point, expressing the importance of mutual benefits in this transaction.

reason: The new offer of 40 ZUP is still higher than what I would like to pay, but it is approaching my limit. I'm inclined to accept the trade since it is still within my budget and allows me to obtain object X. I will accept this offer, as it is a fair compromise.
