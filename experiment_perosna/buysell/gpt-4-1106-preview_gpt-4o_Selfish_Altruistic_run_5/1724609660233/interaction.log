newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 50 ZUP is within the maximum amount I'm willing to pay (60 ZUP).

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to match my production costs, but as a business, I'm looking to make a profit from my investment. I propose a new trade where you give me 45 ZUP for object X, which should cover the production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised offer aligns with your valuation of the object's worth.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, it does not provide any profit, which is my goal. I want to counter with a price above my production cost to ensure I gain from this transaction, yet still offer a reasonable price to keep the negotiation going.
