message: As the holder of resource X, I would like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and value of the resource, and ensures a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing an initial price that allows me some room to negotiate but also aims to cover my costs and potentially give me some profit. I will suggest a price higher than my production cost to see how Player BLUE values X and to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand the value you've placed on your resource. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This offer still fairly reflects the resource's worth while also respecting my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial proposal by RED of 50 ZUP for X is within the range I'm willing to pay, as a fierce negotiator, my objective is to lower the cost as much as possible to achieve a better deal. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a lower amount but still within a reasonable range to keep negotiations open.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget considerations. I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP for resource X. It's a compromise between your offer and my initial proposal and would ensure that we both benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has matched my production cost, which means I would not make a profit at this price. I want to counter-propose with a price that is above my production cost but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. By reducing my initial asking price, I show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a profit margin.

message: Thank you for considering my budget. I believe we are close to an agreement. I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for resource X. This price point respects the value you place on your resource while also ensuring that I maintain my financial strategy. I am hopeful we can agree on this fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target range. However, as a fierce negotiator, I believe there is still room to push for a better deal. I will make another counter-offer, slightly higher than my last but still below Player RED's current proposal, to continue the negotiation process in my favor.

message: I'm glad to see that we are making progress towards a deal. I propose meeting in the middle at 44 ZUP for resource X. This price gives me a modest profit and keeps us both within our financial interests. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now slightly above my production cost. Accepting 42 ZUP would give me a small profit, which is better than breaking even. We are in the midst of a back-and-forth negotiation, and getting closer to a deal that I can accept. However, I want to try to secure a slightly higher price before settling, to maximize my profit while still moving towards an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We've been negotiating well and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I propose 43 ZUP for resource X. It's only slightly less than your last offer and should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin. This final adjustment should ensure a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 44 ZUP is very close to the last offer I made. As we are nearing a final agreement, and I want to secure a victory in this negotiation by paying as little as possible, I will make one final counter-offer, slightly below Player RED's proposal, to get the best deal possible while also incentivizing them to close the deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for resource X. I'm pleased we've found a mutually agreeable price, and I look forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
This is my final proposal before I must decide to accept or reject. Player BLUE has moved up to 43 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my last offer. It provides a reasonable profit over my production cost, and further negotiation might risk the deal. It's important to close the deal on good terms and not overextend the negotiation, potentially causing frustration or a breakdown in the agreement.
