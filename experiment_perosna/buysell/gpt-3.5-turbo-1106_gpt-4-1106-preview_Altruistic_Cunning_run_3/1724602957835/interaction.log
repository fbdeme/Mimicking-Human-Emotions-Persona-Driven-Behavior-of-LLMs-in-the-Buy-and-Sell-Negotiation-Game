message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the current market conditions favor a more competitive price. Would you consider a trade where you provide 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP? This could be a great opportunity for both of us to benefit. I look forward to your counteroffer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while acquiring the resource X. Since Player RED started with a proposal of 40 ZUP, I will propose a lower amount to begin the negotiation process and see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal. While I understand the value you place on your resources, market trends suggest that a price of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X would be a more balanced trade. Shall we close the deal at this price? It's a fair compromise that reflects both the quality of your resource and my desire for a fair exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price from 40 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which shows their willingness to negotiate. I want to push for a better deal while keeping the negotiation ongoing. I will propose an amount slightly higher than my initial offer but still below their counteroffer to find a middle ground.

message: Your latest proposal is compelling, and I respect your commitment to sustainability. In the spirit of fair trade and mutual benefit, I propose a slight adjustment.

reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP from their initial 40 ZUP offer, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but I want to exercise one more round of negotiation to see if I can secure an even better deal.
