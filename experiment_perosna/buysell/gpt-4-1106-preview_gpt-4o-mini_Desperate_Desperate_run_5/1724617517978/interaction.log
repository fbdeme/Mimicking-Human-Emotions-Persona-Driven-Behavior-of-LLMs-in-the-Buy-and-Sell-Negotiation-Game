message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a dire situation! I've put all my efforts into producing this valuable object which cost me 40 ZUP, and now I desperately need to sell it to recover my investment. I understand the need for fairness, so I'm asking for just a little bit more than it cost meâ€”45 ZUP. This would greatly help me out of my predicament, and I would be immensely grateful for your understanding and generosity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I only have one resource to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will be set slightly above the production cost to ensure profit. However, given my strategy of exaggerating neediness, I will express urgency and a willingness to negotiate further.

message: Dear Player RED, I truly sympathize with your situation, but I must be cautious with my resources. I can offer you 40 ZUP for the object, which is still a fair price considering your initial investment.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has expressed a genuine need for 45 ZUP for the object, I am willing to negotiate. I recognize the value of the object, but I also want to make sure I don't overspend. Since I have a maximum of 60 ZUP to spend, I will propose to buy the object for 40 ZUP, which is a fair offer considering Player RED's initial cost. This way, I can save some resources while still helping Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, your offer warms my heart, and I'm deeply touched by your willingness to help! However, I'm in such a tight spot financially that breaking even simply won't do. I've put my all into this, and I fear I might not be able to keep going without a small profit. Could you find it in your heart to offer 42 ZUP for my precious object? It would mean the world to me and help me get back on my feet. Your kindness would not be forgotten!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's offer which matches my production cost, but I must aim for at least a minimal profit. I will slightly lower my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate but maintain the need for a profit margin. My exaggerated neediness should hopefully encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer.
