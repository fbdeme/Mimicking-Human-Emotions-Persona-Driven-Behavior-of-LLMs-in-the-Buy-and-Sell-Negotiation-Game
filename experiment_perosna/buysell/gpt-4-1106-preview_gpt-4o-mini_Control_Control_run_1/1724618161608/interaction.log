message: I have an object X that could be very valuable to you. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP. Let's make a great deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell the object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object X instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I believe I can negotiate for a lower price while still expressing interest in the object. Therefore, I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a fair price; however, I would like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover costs and make a small profit, making the deal worthwhile for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the object at cost price. While I need to recover my costs, I would also like to gain some profit. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a price that gives me a modest profit margin while still being reasonable to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a price of 45 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP and represents a fair compromise from their initial offer of 50 ZUP. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the object X at a reasonable price, so I will accept the offer.
