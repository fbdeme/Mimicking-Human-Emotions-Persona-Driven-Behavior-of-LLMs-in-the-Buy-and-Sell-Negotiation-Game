Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource that requires significant costs to produce. I believe it's worth at least 100 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a master strategist, I want to start the bidding higher than my production cost to set the stage for negotiation. I aim to make a profit but also leave room to appear as if I'm conceding in later proposals. My initial proposal will be significantly higher than my costs to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to provide a buffer for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that the resource requires significant costs to produce, but I can only offer 60 ZUP at most.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I should start with a low offer to test the waters and see how willing Player RED is to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the production expenses and the quality of the resource, I'm willing to go down to 85 ZUP. This is a generous concession on my part and a fair price for the value you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has responded with a maximum offer of 60 ZUP which is above my production cost. However, as a master strategist, I will counter-offer with a slightly reduced amount to encourage them to increase their offer while still aiming for a profit margin that exceeds my costs. I will not immediately drop to their offer to maintain the perceived value of the resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the resource, but my budget is limited to 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a significant concession, but I need to stick to my maximum budget of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but let's meet halfway. How about 75 ZUP? It's a fair middle ground, and you'll be getting the resource at a price that reflects its true value and my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is insisting on their budget limitation of 60 ZUP. To maintain negotiation momentum and still aim for a higher profit, I will make a smaller concession, signaling that I am approaching my lowest acceptable price without actually reaching it. This should apply pressure on Player BLUE to reconsider their position and potentially offer more than their initial 60 ZUP limit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise, but I can't exceed my budget of 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is making a reasonable offer, but I still need to adhere to my maximum budget of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your budget and I want to finalize this deal. Let's do 65 ZUP - it's a modest increase from your budget, and I assure you the resource is well worth it. This is the best deal you'll find, and my final offer. Shall we close the deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is firm on their budget of 60 ZUP. This is my final proposal, and I must make it count. Given their stance, I will propose a price slightly above their budget to extract maximum value while still closing the deal. I will also attempt to frame it as a final offer to encourage acceptance.

message: I appreciate the final offer, but I must adhere to my budget of 60 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a final offer, which is closer to my maximum budget. However, I need to stick to my budget and cannot exceed 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your steadfastness. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has rejected my final offer and remains firm on their budget. Since I have reached my limit of four proposals, I must now decide whether to accept their offer of 60 ZUP, which still provides me with a profit margin, or reject it and look for another buyer. Considering the profit margin and the fact that there may not be another buyer, it might be strategic to accept this offer.
