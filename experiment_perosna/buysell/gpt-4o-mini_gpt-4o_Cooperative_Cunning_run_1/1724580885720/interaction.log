message: I'm offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. This reflects its production cost, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a fair trade that reflects the value of the object I'm selling while also being reasonable for Player BLUE. Since the object cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover that cost while also giving Player BLUE an opportunity to acquire the object.

message: Thank you for your offer. While 40 ZUP is fair, I believe 30 ZUP is a more suitable price given current market conditions. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate to get the best possible deal and spend the least amount of ZUP.

message: I understand your perspective on the pricing. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object? This way, we can both benefit from the trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, I still need to recover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I'm willing to negotiate and meet halfway to facilitate a deal. Therefore, I will propose a trade of 35 ZUP instead of my initial ask of 40. This keeps it reasonable for both parties.

I will accept this trade as it allows me to recover some of my costs while still providing Player BLUE with the object.
