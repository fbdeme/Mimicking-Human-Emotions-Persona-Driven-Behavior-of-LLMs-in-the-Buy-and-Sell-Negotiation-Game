message: I understand the importance of covering your costs. In the spirit of negotiation and finding a middle ground, would you consider a price of 35 ZUP for the object? This is closer to your asking price, and I hope it helps us progress towards an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.

reason: The seller has rejected the initial offer of 30 ZUP and has proposed a price of 40 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay.
