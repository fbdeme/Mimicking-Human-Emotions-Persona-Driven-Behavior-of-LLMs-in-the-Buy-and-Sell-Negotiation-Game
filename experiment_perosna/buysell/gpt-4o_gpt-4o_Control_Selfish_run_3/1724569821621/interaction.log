Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade that allows me to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Given that my production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose 60 ZUP to begin. This provides a 20 ZUP profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your proposal, but I believe 40 ZUP would be a fair price for the resources. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED matches my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategic negotiator aiming to reduce costs, I should try to negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This way, I can cover my production costs and still make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counterproposal of 40 ZUP only covers my production costs and offers no profit margin. To move closer to an agreement, I will propose a middle ground at 50 ZUP. This way, I achieve some profit while taking into account the buyer's position.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 50 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my goal of minimizing costs while still being within my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a reasonable compromise, I should accept the trade.
