message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource here. Considering the production costs and the market value, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start the bid high to give myself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that is higher than my costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 60 ZUP is right at my upper limit. Let's start with a more reasonable number. How about 50 ZUP for your resource? It's a good starting point for both of us to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, it's in my best interest to start the negotiation lower to leave room for bargaining. By doing so, I can potentially acquire the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay and save ZUP for future transactions. I'll propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I value your desire to reach a fair agreement. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How does 55 ZUP sound to you? It's a competitive price that reflects the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a higher price to maximize profit. I'll counter with a slightly lower amount than the initial offer but still above the cost to keep the negotiation in my favor.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I'm glad we're negotiating. Let's adjust the offer slightly to reflect my budget concerns. I propose 52 ZUP for your resource. This offer is competitive while allowing us some space for further discussion if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I want to spend the least amount of ZUP possible, I should propose a slightly lower amount to further negotiate. This can potentially lead to savings and also shows that I am engaging in the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is sensible, and I appreciate your flexibility. To expedite our negotiation and find a middle ground, I propose 54 ZUP. This price should accommodate your budget concerns while also respecting the value of the resource. Shall we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now at 52 ZUP, which is still a profit. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will attempt to increase the price slightly to edge out a better deal. I have limited proposals left, so I must make this one count.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You've been very accommodating, and I believe we're almost there. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a minor adjustment to 53 ZUP. It's a fair price that ensures both of us walk away satisfied with the exchange. Let's close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 54 ZUP, which is within the acceptable range of my goal. However, as a master strategist seeking to spend the least amount of ZUP, I should make one final push to see if I can secure the resource for an even lower price, while still keeping the offer appealing enough for Player RED to consider.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable. I agree that 53 ZUP is a fair and satisfactory price for both parties. Let's close the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 53 ZUP is only 1 ZUP less than my previous proposal and still allows for a significant profit margin. As this is my final proposal, it's strategic to accept this offer, ensuring a successful and profitable transaction without further risking the deal.
