message: I've got a high-quality resource available, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm starting the bid at 80 ZUP. This is a premium product with a high value on the market. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I will start with a high asking price to set the stage for negotiation. My goal is to maximize my return on investment, but I'm willing to negotiate down to secure a deal. The initial proposal is intentionally higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. However, my budget allows me to propose a trade at 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, keeping in mind the value you've placed on your product and my financial constraints. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is 80 ZUP which is above my maximum willingness to pay. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to make a counteroffer that is closer to my budget and also leaves room for further negotiation, understanding that the seller also has interests that need to be met.

message: I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your offer. Nevertheless, the quality of this resource justifies a higher investment. Let's meet in the middleâ€”I propose a trade at 65 ZUP. This price reflects both the value of my resource and a nod to your budget constraints. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is below my initial asking price, but it is above my cost of production. As a tough negotiator, I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial ask but still provides some concession towards the middle ground. I aim to keep the negotiations competitive and push for a higher price.

reason: The seller has come down to 65 ZUP, which is a positive step towards my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is still above my budget.

reason: Player RED has shown flexibility by reducing the price to 62 ZUP, which is very close to my maximum willingness to pay.
