message: I'm in a really tight spot and I need to sell this as quickly as possible. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, but I spent 40 ZUP to make it. Please, let's make a deal that's fair for both of us. I'm counting on your help here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the first proposal, I want to set a starting price that accounts for my production costs, but I will feign urgency to sell which might make Player BLUE believe they can get the resource for cheaper than I would normally sell it. I aim to instill a sense of opportunity for Player BLUE to make a quick and advantageous deal.

message: I understand your urgency but as you know, the market is quite volatile. I'll start the bid at 30 ZUP to take the object off your hands quickly and relieve you of your tight spot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP. As a cutthroat negotiator, my first proposal will be significantly lower than the asking price to create room for negotiation and to try to acquire the object for far less than my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your quick response, but I'm sure you understand that I can't go below my production costs. The 50 ZUP I initially asked for was already a plea for help. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? How about 45 ZUP? I would really appreciate your cooperation, and it would get me out of this bind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is below my production cost. To maintain the illusion of desperation, I will lower my asking price but still aim to cover my costs and potentially secure a slight profit. I would like to keep the negotiation going without settling for less than the production cost, so I will make a counterproposal that's closer to my intended goal.

message: I'm willing to move up a bit from my initial offer because I do want to help. Let's say 35 ZUP. It's a fair increase from my side and should still give you some room above your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their new asking price, to keep the negotiations in my favor and to spend as little as possible.

message: You have no idea how much I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. I'm truly in a dire situation. I've crunched the numbers and the lowest I can go to just break even is 40 ZUP. It's the bare minimum to cover my costs. Please, let's settle at 40 ZUP. You'd be helping me immensely, and I would be forever grateful for your understanding and support in this tough time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is still offering less than my production cost. I need to convey a sense of increased desperation while still pushing for a price that at least covers my costs. I will lower the price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I must stress the urgency and my difficult position to encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I hear you, and I don't want to put you in a tough spot. Let's do 37 ZUP. This is me stretching my budget to help you out, and it's a fair middle ground that gets close to covering your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on 40 ZUP as the minimum. I will attempt one more negotiation step, offering a bit more than my previous offer but still below their asking price. This should signal my interest in closing the deal while maintaining a strong negotiating position.

message: Your kindness really shines through, and I can't tell you how much it means to me during this difficult period. I'm stretching myself thin, and every ZUP counts. Could we possibly settle on 38 ZUP? It's just a bit more, and it would cover my costs completely. I promise this is the absolute floor for me, and you'd be pulling me back from the edge. Thank you for being so considerate and understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. As this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. I need to maintain the emotional appeal to push for a price that covers my production costs. I will accept the 37 ZUP as a last resort, but first, I will make one final attempt to reach my goal of at least breaking even.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I respect your position and appreciate the transparency. Let's settle on 38 ZUP and consider it a deal. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a final plea for 38 ZUP. This is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, and the amount is well within my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this offer, I close the deal efficiently, and both parties can walk away satisfied.
