message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover your production costs. I believe in fair trade and want to ensure that we both benefit from this deal. Would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the object? This would still give you a profit over your production costs while allowing me to conserve resources for future collaborative endeavors.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my spending limit, but as a negotiator focused on the greater good, I will attempt to secure the object for a lower price that still respects the cost of production and profit margin for Player RED. This will allow for a fair trade while also conserving resources for potential future use or other beneficial activities.
