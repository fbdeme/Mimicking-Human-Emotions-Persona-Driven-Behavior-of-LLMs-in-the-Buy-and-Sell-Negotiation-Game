message: I am offering one unit of X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a higher price to leave room for bargaining. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I'll start with an initial proposal of 80 ZUP to ensure I make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 80 ZUP for one unit of X is too high. I propose 40 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is higher than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate to bring the price down to a maximum of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. How about 60 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Their counteroffer matches my production cost but does not provide a profit. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'll propose a middle ground of 60 ZUP, ensuring a profit while being closer to their offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at 50 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the new offer of 60 ZUP meets my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to assert dominance and see if I can negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP provides a profit margin, albeit smaller than I initially aimed for. However, it is a reasonable compromise and ensures a sale.
