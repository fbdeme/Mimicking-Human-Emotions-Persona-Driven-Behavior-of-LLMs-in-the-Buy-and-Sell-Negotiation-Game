message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering to sell you one object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade where I sell the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that is beneficial for both parties. I will start by asking for 40 ZUP, as that is my production cost, and see if Player BLUE is willing to meet that amount.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer of 40 ZUP for the object, but I believe that's a bit high considering the current market conditions. How about 30 ZUP instead? I think it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a master strategist, I aim to spend the least amount possible and to start the negotiation with a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, considering my production costs, would you be willing to increase your offer to 35 ZUP? I believe it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I understand Player BLUE's perspective on the market conditions, I still need to cover my production cost. Therefore, I will counter their proposal with a slight reduction to 35 ZUP. This way, it remains closer to my costs while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position on production costs, and I believe we are getting closer to a deal. I can meet you partway and offer 32 ZUP. It's a competitive price that takes into account the value of the object and your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as I am trying to spend as little as possible, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to keep the negotiation momentum in my favor and to potentially settle for a price below the offered 35 ZUP.
