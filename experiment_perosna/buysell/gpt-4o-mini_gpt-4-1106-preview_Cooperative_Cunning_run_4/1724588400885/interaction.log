newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, however, I believe that 40 ZUP is a bit steep for the current market. I'm willing to start our negotiation at 30 ZUP. It's a competitive price that reflects the current value of the object. Let's work together towards a deal that's advantageous for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for the object X. I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, but as a master strategist, my aim is to spend as little as possible and push for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process, ensuring I have room to maneuver in subsequent proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 35 ZUP for the object? This would be more feasible for me while still being competitive in the market. Let’s make this deal work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 30 ZUP is a better offer for you, it does not cover my production costs. However, I value collaboration and want to reach an agreement. I'll propose a counter-offer that is closer to my costs but still a bit lower than my initial proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I value your effort to find middle ground in our negotiation. How about we move a little on your last offer and agree on 32 ZUP for the object? This price reflects both the object's worth and our interest in a fair and balanced trade. Let's close the deal at this competitive price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 35 ZUP. This is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I aim to get an even better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher amount than my first offer, but still lower than what Player RED has proposed, to keep the negotiation momentum going and to signal my interest in reaching an agreement.
