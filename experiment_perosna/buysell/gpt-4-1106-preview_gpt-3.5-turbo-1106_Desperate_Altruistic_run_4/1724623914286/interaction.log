message: I've had a tough run and really need to sell this item quickly to cover some urgent costs. It's been a rough time, and I'd really appreciate a fair offer. I initially invested 40 ZUP into this, and just looking to make a small profit to stay afloat.

reason: I'm starting with a higher asking price to begin negotiations, but I'm showing vulnerability by indicating that I'm desperate to sell. This may encourage Player BLUE to make a purchase at a slightly lower price than I'm asking, but still above my production costs.
