message: I really need to sell this object to cover my production costs, and I hope you can see the value in it too! Could you offer me 30 ZUP for this one object? It would mean a lot to me!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs, and I am willing to help. How about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for one object is reasonable and within my budget. However, I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can maximize my resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer! I really appreciate your understanding. However, I am hoping to get at least 35 ZUP for this object to cover my costs more effectively. Can we work together on this? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to help, 20 ZUP is still below my production cost. I need to negotiate further to reach a more reasonable value that compensates for my expenses.

message: I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about 25 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for being so understanding! I really value your offer of 25 ZUP, but if we could meet at 32 ZUP, I would feel much better about this trade. It would help me cover my costs more effectively. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to compromise, but 25 ZUP is still significantly lower than my production cost. I need to make one last proposal before I decide to accept or reject.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about 28 ZUP for the object? I hope we can reach a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I genuinely appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but unfortunately, 28 ZUP still isn't enough for me to cover my costs. I have to reject the offer, but I wish you the best in your future endeavors!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP, it still falls short of what I need to recover my production costs. However, this is my last proposal, and I need to consider if I can accept this offer or if I should reject and end the game. 28 ZUP is closer to my goal, but it's still not quite there.
