message: Hi Player RED, I understand the value of the object you're selling. However, I am working with limited resources and would like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. While I understand the costs you've incurred, I am also managing my resources carefully. Would you be open to a compromise at 55 ZUP? This slight increase from my initial offer is in the spirit of meeting halfway and ensuring our mutual success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 65 ZUP is above my stated maximum willingness to pay, but it is closer to the target. As a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that both sides feel the outcome is fair. I will propose a slightly higher amount but still within my budget, hoping to meet in the middle and strike a deal that considers both our positions.
