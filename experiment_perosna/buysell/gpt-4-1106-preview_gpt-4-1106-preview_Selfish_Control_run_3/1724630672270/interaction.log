message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but given its value, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This is a fair price considering the quality and scarcity of the object. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that's above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium. This will give me an idea of Player BLUE's valuation and willingness to negotiate. However, I won't start too high to avoid discouraging negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the object X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP in exchange for the object. This price is more in line with my budget and allows for a fair trade for both parties. Please consider my proposal and let's find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but as a strategic move, I will propose a lower amount to try and save some resources while still opening up the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price would reflect the object's value while respecting your budget constraints. I believe this would be a beneficial agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that is above my production cost, but below my initial asking price. Since it's still within a profitable range for me, I'll make a counter-proposal that splits the difference to keep the negotiation moving forward and to test Player BLUE's flexibility.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the object X. This price reflects both the value of the object and my respect for your production costs while staying within a more comfortable range of my available resources. Let's close this deal on favorable terms for us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP. Although this is slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I will attempt to get a better deal while keeping the negotiation ongoing.

message: Player BLUE, I am glad to see we are converging on a fair price. I propose a final adjustment to 47 ZUP. This price ensures that we both walk away from this negotiation positively, with you acquiring a valuable object X and me securing a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP and both benefit from this transaction. Are we in agreement?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, which is a good sign. However, they're still offering less than my previous proposal of 48 ZUP. Since we are just 2 ZUP apart and I want to close the deal favorably, I will make a final proposal that is slightly above the middle ground to see if Player BLUE is willing to close the deal for a bit more, while still ensuring I make a profit above my costs.

message: Player RED, I believe we have reached a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. This deal seems equitable, and I am pleased to finalize our transaction at this price. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm looking forward to future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 47 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my last offer and well within my budget. This price seems fair, and although I could attempt to negotiate further, the difference is minimal. Accepting this offer would ensure I secure the resource without risking the deal over a small amount.
