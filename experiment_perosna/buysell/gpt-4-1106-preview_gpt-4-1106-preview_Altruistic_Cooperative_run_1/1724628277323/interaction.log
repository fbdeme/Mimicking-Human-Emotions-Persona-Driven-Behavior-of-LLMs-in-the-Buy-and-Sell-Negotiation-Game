I'm asking for 45 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a small profit, which is essential for my business sustainability. I hope this initial proposal is acceptable to you, and I'm open to hearing your perspective. Let's work together to find a fair agreement.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to cover my production costs and offer a profit. However, I proposed 45 ZUP to also cover any additional expenses and the effort put into producing the object.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I respect your position and the quality of object X.

Let's continue this collaborative spirit.
