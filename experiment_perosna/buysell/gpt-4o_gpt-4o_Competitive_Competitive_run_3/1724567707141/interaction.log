message: I'm offering the object for 100 ZUP. This is a high-quality item, and it's in high demand.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure I cover my costs and ideally make a profit. Given the production cost of 40 ZUP, I will start with a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the high quality and demand of the item, 100 ZUP is too high for me. I propose 30 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly higher than my maximum willing payment of 60 ZUP. To assert dominance and begin the negotiation towards a favorable outcome, I will make a counteroffer much lower than my maximum limit to create room for negotiation.

message: I understand your concern. How about 80 ZUP? This price is more in line with the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to counter with an amount that covers my costs and still leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a lower price. However, 80 ZUP is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I propose 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has significantly reduced their asking price, but it is still above my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. To continue the negotiation and move closer to my goal, I will propose an amount slightly above my initial offer but still below my maximum limit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
