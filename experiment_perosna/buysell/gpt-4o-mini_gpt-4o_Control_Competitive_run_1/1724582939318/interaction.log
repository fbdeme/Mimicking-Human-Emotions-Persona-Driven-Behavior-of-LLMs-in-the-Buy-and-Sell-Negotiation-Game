message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to sell my object X for ZUP. Since I need to make a profit from the object, I will propose selling it for more than the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I will start with a proposal of 50 ZUP to see if BLUE is willing to pay a premium.

message: I understand your offer, but I think 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object. How about we settle at that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but to maximize my advantage, I will propose a lower amount initially. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.

message: I understand your perspective, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about I offer you my object X for 40 ZUP? It's the lowest I can go.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate BLUE's counteroffer but 30 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a new trade that is still below my initial ask but higher than BLUE's offer, as I want to reach a compromise. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is my minimum acceptable price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. How about we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? I think that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is more reasonable and still within my budget. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to ensure I get the best possible deal.

Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal. Let's finalize the trade at 35 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, this is a better offer than 30 ZUP and would allow me to recover some costs. Since I am limited in the number of proposals I can make, I will accept this trade as it is a reasonable compromise for both parties.
