Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe 15 ZUP is a fair price for the object. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 30 ZUP is quite reasonable. However, as a strategic negotiator, I aim to reduce the ZUP I spend. I will propose a lower amount to assert dominance and see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your response! I appreciate your offer of 15 ZUP, but I believe that 25 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object. Let's find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE is proposing a lower amount, but 15 ZUP is significantly less than the cost of producing the object. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to negotiate while still trying to maximize my gain.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make a slightly lower counteroffer to see if I can secure the object for less while still being fair.
