message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object X ready for sale. Considering its exceptional value, I am starting the bidding at 60 ZUP. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm sure you'll find the price to be fair for such a rare commodity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start the negotiation by setting a high price, expecting the other player to negotiate down. This will allow me room to maneuver and still end up with a desirable amount of ZUP. I'll propose a price that's higher than my production cost to create a buffer for negotiation and to maximize profit.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. While 55 ZUP is certainly closer to my valuation, I would like to propose a price of 52 ZUP. This offer takes us closer to the middle ground and represents a fair compromise.

message: Your offer of 52 ZUP is noted and appreciated, Player BLUE. To reach an amicable agreement and to honor the value of both your proposition and object X, I propose we meet almost halfway from your offer and my previous one. I suggest a price of 54 ZUP.

I will make a small concession from my last proposal to show continued willingness to negotiate, but I will not go as low as 52 ZUP. I aim to finalize the deal closer to my previous proposal while still giving Player BLUE the feeling of a successful negotiation.
