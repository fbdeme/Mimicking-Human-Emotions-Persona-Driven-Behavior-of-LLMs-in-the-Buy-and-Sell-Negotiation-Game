message: Esteemed Player BLUE, the object X is of exceptional quality and in high demand. Given the costs of production and the market value, I believe a fair price would be 60 ZUP. I'm sure you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a shrewd negotiator, my goal is to secure the highest price for my object. I have to start with a higher asking price than what it cost me, leaving room for negotiation. I'll propose a price that gives me a profit but is also likely to be countered by Player BLUE, giving me insight into their willingness to pay.
