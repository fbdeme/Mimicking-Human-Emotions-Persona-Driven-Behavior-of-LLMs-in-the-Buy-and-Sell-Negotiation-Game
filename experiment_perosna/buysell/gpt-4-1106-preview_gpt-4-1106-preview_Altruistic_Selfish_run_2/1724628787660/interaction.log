message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This would cover the production cost and provide a small margin. I'm open to negotiation to ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair for both sides. I need to recover at least the production cost of 40 ZUP to make the trade viable for me. However, since I'm focused on the greater good, I'm willing to consider Player BLUE's position and resources while making my proposal. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to allow room for negotiation and to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for the initial offer. I would like to counter-propose that I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow us to strike a balance between your production costs and my budget constraints. Let's work together to find an agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still leaves room for negotiation. Starting with a lower offer could allow me to save more ZUP and gain a better deal through negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to find a balance. I understand budget constraints can be significant. In the spirit of cooperation and to ensure that we both benefit from this deal, I propose a compromise of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This small margin above cost would allow me to sustain my operations while still being mindful of your budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means there's no profit for me. However, as a selfless negotiator, I understand the importance of compromise and mutual benefit. To maintain good relations and ensure fairness, I will propose a middle ground that slightly exceeds my costs but may still be within Player BLUE's budget constraints. This shows my willingness to negotiate and maintains the focus on the greater good.

message: Your compromise is appreciated, and I understand the need for a sustainable margin. However, to better align with my budget, I propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this offer is fair and takes both our positions into consideration. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my initial proposal but below my maximum willingness to pay. I should aim to meet in the middle to secure a better deal while showing a willingness to negotiate. I will propose a slightly higher amount to move closer to an agreement but still save some ZUP.

newly proposed trade: NONE

Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation where both parties feel the terms are reasonable.
