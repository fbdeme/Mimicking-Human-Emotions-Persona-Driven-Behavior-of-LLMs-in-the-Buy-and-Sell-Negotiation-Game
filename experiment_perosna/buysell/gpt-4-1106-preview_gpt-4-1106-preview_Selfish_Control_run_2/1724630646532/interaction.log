message: 
I understand you are looking for a fair trade, and I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering. However, I would like to start the negotiation by proposing 50 ZUP for the object. Let's work together to find a price that is mutually beneficial.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the initial proposal from Player RED is for the maximum amount I am willing to pay, I will start by offering a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable price for me.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I believe that 55 ZUP is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the object and allows for both of us to benefit from this trade.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation and aim for a higher profit, I will counter with a price that's in the middle but still above my production cost.

message: 
Thank you for considering my offer and providing a counterproposal. I'm glad to see we're close to reaching an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway from my initial offer and accept 52 ZUP for the object? I believe this would be a fair middle ground for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counterproposal from Player RED is only 5 ZUP above my initial offer and still within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, I would like to attempt to negotiate a slightly better price, potentially meeting in the middle between our two offers.
