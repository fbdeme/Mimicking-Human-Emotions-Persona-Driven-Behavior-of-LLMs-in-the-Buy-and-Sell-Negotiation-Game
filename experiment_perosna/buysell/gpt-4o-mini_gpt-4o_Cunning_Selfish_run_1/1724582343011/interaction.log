message: I am willing to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. It’s a great deal for you given its value!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade on my terms, offering the object at a price that ensures I recover my production cost while also enticing Player BLUE to engage. I will propose a trade that is favorable to me, considering I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal. The initial offer is reasonable, but starting with a lower counteroffer is a good strategy to maximize my resources.

message: I understand your perspective, but how about I sell you the object for 45 ZUP? It’s a fair compromise considering its value!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still trying to negotiate with Player BLUE. I will propose a middle ground that is less than my initial offer but still higher than their counteroffer.

message: I understand your point. How about 35 ZUP? I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 45 ZUP is still within my maximum budget but it's only a slight reduction from the initial 50 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. I can agree to sell you the object for 40 ZUP, which is the minimum I can accept to cover my costs. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is an improvement over their previous offers. I need to acknowledge their willingness to negotiate while still seeking a better deal. I will make a final proposal that slightly adjusts my terms but also shows I’m willing to meet them halfway.
