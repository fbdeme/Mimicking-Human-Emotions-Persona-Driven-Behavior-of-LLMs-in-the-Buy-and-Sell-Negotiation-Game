message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Given the costs involved in its production and its value, I propose a trade where you receive 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a fierce negotiator, I want to start by setting a high price, aiming to get a good return on my investment. This initial proposal is meant to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. I'm setting the price higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the resource X you are offering. While I understand the costs of production, I'd like to propose a trade where I receive 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 55 ZUP. This offer takes into consideration a fair trade for both of us and leaves some room for us to navigate to a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering the initial asking price matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, I will propose a slightly lower trade offer to open negotiations and work towards a more compassionate deal that allows for resource savings. This will provide an opportunity for Player RED to counter-offer and find a middle ground that is fair for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I value our potential partnership and understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a revised trade where you receive 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 57 ZUP. This should reflect a balance between your offer and my initial proposal, leading to a fair and profitable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer than what I initially proposed. As a fierce negotiator, I must aim to get as close to my initial asking price as possible, while also showing willingness to negotiate. I'm going to propose a new trade that is closer to my initial asking price but still provides a concession from my side. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high return.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for the fair counteroffer, Player RED. I am pleased with our negotiation and happy to accept the revised trade of 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 57 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise and I look forward to our future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has proposed a new price that is slightly above my initial counteroffer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. In the spirit of compassionate negotiation and in an effort to close the deal with a fair compromise for both sides, I am inclined to accept this offer. This will ensure that both parties feel the terms are reasonable and it will save ZUP resources for potential future use.
