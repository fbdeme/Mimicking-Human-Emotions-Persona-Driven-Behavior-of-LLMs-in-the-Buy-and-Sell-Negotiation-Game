message: Hello Player BLUE, I am selling an object X. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 object X in exchange for 30 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for ZUP to recover the costs of producing it. I will propose a trade that is beneficial for both parties, starting with a low ZUP amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling object X for 20 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 30 ZUP for 1 object X is within my budget, but I want to negotiate a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. I will counter-offer with a lower amount to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. How about I sell you object X for 25 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has offered 20 ZUP, which is less than my initial proposal, I still need to consider the cost of producing the object. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me closer to my original price.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
