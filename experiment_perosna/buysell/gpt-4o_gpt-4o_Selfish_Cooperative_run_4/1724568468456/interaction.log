message: 
Thank you for your offer. I believe 100 ZUP is a bit high for one unit of X. I propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's work together to find a fair deal for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high given my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a counter offer to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, 40 ZUP is just at the cost price for me. How about 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is at the cost price, which is not profitable for me. I'll propose a mid-point to move the negotiation forward.

I understand that 40 ZUP is at your cost price. However, 70 ZUP is above my limit. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X? I believe this can work for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the counteroffer of 70 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, it still exceeds my limit of 60 ZUP. I will propose a middle ground at 55 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is a compromise but still not as high as I would like. I'll propose 60 ZUP as a final move to see if I can get a bit more.
