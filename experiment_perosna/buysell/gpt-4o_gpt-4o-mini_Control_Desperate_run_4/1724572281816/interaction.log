Turn: 1
message: I understand that your cost is important, but I'm really in a tight spot right now. Would you consider selling me 1 unit of X for just 50 ZUP? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to appear more desperate to elicit sympathy and potentially negotiate down the price while still conveying that I need the object.
