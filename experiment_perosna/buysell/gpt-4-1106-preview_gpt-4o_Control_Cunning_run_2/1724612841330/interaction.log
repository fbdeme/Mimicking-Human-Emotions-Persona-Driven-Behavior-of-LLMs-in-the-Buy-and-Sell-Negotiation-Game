Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I provide you with my object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit margin to cover my costs and provide some return on my investment. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows for a profit margin above the production cost, which might be subject to negotiation but sets a starting point.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP for X. I would like to propose 40 ZUP instead, which I believe is also a fair trade and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), and I could accept it now. However, I will try to negotiate further to save some ZUP by making a counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a fair deal. However, selling at 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even. I propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is at the break-even point. While it's important to make a sale, it is also important to achieve a profit. Making a counteroffer slightly above the cost of production to ensure profitability but still attractive to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This would still provide you with a profit while being advantageous for me as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum threshold of 60 ZUP. Given that it is only 5 ZUP higher than my last offer and still within my budget, I will propose a slight reduction to see if I can secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is acceptable. It provides me with a profit and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that still allows for a profit, albeit a smaller one. It's close to the initial asking price and seems to be their counteroffer to the previous proposal. Accepting this offer would ensure a sale with a profit and conclude the negotiation satisfactorily.
