message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality item X that I am willing to sell. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to sell my resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and also make a profit. I will start by setting a higher price than my costs to give room for negotiation, expecting the other player to counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I recognize the value of the item X, but I also have to consider my budget. I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the item. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range of spending for the resource X. However, as a calculating negotiator, I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial asking price to start the negotiation and potentially save ZUP. I will start lower to give room for negotiation but will not go below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand budget constraints, but I believe item X's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for item X, ensuring quality and value for you while allowing me a modest profit. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is close to my production cost, but I would like to make a profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price, but still above my production cost, to continue the negotiation and seek a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, Player RED. I want to respect your need for a profit while also staying within my budget. Let's settle on 46 ZUP for item X. This price allows you to profit while still providing me with the value I seek. Do we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still within the acceptable range. I will now attempt to reach a final agreement that is closer to my initial offer while still providing Player RED with a reasonable amount of ZUP for item X. This back-and-forth negotiation is typical and helps to ensure that both parties feel like they have gained from the trade.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding and your latest offer. I think we're almost there. To finalize our deal and to cover my costs with a reasonable margin, I propose 47 ZUP for item X. This ensures I can sustain my business while still providing you with a great value. Can we agree on this and make it a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come closer to my asking price, and while it's still below my last proposal, it does give me a profit over the production cost. I want to close the deal without dragging the negotiation out too much, but I'll try for a final small increase to see if there's room for a slightly better outcome.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for item X is acceptable to me, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's make it a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is just 1 ZUP higher than my previous offer, and it is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Since the negotiation seems to have reached a point where Player RED is not likely to go lower, and to avoid the risk of a breakdown in negotiations, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. This would conclude the negotiation successfully and within my planned budget.
