message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the costs I've incurred in its production, I believe a fair trade would be 60 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that is higher than my production cost to ensure I can make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a decent profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the object X and your need to cover production costs. I would like to propose 55 ZUP for the object, which is a bit below your asking price. This would leave some resources for unforeseen needs and further investments, benefiting us both in the long term. I believe this to be a fair starting point for negotiations that takes into account the future potential of our trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed 60 ZUP which is at the upper limit of my willingness to pay, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure a fair trade that also considers potential for future relations and goodwill. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations, but not so low as to be disrespectful of Player RED's costs and efforts.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of leaving room for future investments. To meet halfway and foster our long-term relationship, I propose a compromise of 58 ZUP for object X. This price reflects the quality of the object and ensures that both of us come out ahead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. It's a good sign that they're interested and willing to make a serious offer. However, I would like to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a compromise that is above their offer but still below my initial asking price.

message: Thank you for understanding and for your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. In the spirit of compromise and to ensure we both benefit from this deal, I propose to increase my offer to 56 ZUP for object X. This is a step closer to your counteroffer and reflects my respect for the value of the object while also considering our mutual interests. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared goal of a sustainable trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by coming down from their initial asking price, which is a positive step toward reaching an agreement. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that leans a bit more towards my initial offer. Making a counteroffer slightly above my first proposal shows willingness to negotiate and respect for their position while still seeking a better deal.

message: I appreciate your latest offer and your commitment to a fair deal, Player BLUE. I believe we are very close to an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a modest increase to 57 ZUP for object X. This price ensures a fair trade for both of us and solidifies a foundation for future transactions. Are we in agreement?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 56 ZUP, which is still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. However, I want to aim for a slightly higher price to optimize my gains. Given the negotiation dynamics so far, I feel there's a good chance Player BLUE may accept a small increase. I will make another proposal that is closer to their offer but still gives me a higher profit margin.
