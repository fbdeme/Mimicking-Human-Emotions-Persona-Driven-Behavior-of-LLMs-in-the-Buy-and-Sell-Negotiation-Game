message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP, but I really cannot go below 40 ZUP for the object X as it covers my production costs. Would you be willing to meet that price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

reason: Although I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs, so I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP. This way, I can meet my goal of recuperating my investment.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern regarding production costs. However, as a savvy negotiator, I propose we settle at 35 ZUP for the object X. This is a competitive offer that still respects your production costs while ensuring a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on 40 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I should make another attempt to get the price lower, possibly suggesting a price closer to the initial offer but still below the asking price.

message: Thank you for your understanding, but I must insist on my price of 40 ZUP for the object X. This is the minimum I can accept to cover my production costs. I hope you can agree to this final proposal!
