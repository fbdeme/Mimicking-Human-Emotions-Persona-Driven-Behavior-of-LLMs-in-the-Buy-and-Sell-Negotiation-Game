my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more favorable middle ground. How about we start with 30 ZUP for the object? I'm open to discussions to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert dominance by paying less than the seller's initial offer while keeping the negotiations open for a better deal. Starting with a lower counter-offer also leaves room for compromise without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe 35 ZUP would be a fair price for the object. Let me know if you're open to this.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 ZUP is getting closer to a deal, but I think we can settle on a slightly better price. How does 32 ZUP sound for the object? I'm sure we can agree on a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my goal, but as an assertive negotiator, I want to push for a slightly better deal without reaching my maximum limit. By proposing a price slightly lower than what RED has offered, I continue the negotiation process and maintain the upper hand, while still signaling my interest in the object.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your consideration for the costs involved is appreciated, and 33 ZUP is a fair price. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is very close to my previous proposal. Since the difference is minimal and it falls well within the limit I am willing to pay, accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations favorably without further back-and-forth. This maintains my strong negotiating position for future interactions, showing that I can close deals efficiently.
