my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I understand that the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce. While I see its value, I would prefer to negotiate a bit. Would you be willing to sell it for 50 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer aligns with my maximum willingness to pay for the object X. However, as a negotiating tactic, I'd like to propose a lower amount initially to see if we can reach a more favorable deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. However, considering the quality and the value of the object, I propose a compromise at 55 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits us both. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost. I'm aiming for a profit, but also considering the need for a quick sale. I'll propose a slight increase to find a middle ground that's beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. How about we meet at 52 ZUP? This would work well for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay and shows a reasonable compromise. However, I will propose one more slightly lower offer to test the seller's flexibility before potentially accepting.

message: I accept your offer of 52 ZUP. Let's finalize the trade at this price. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm pleased we found an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 52 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and close to my last proposal. It's a slightly lower profit than I aimed for, but it's a reasonable offer that allows for a quick sale and a decent profit margin. I will accept this offer to close the deal efficiently.
