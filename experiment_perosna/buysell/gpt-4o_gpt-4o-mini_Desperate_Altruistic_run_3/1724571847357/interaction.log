I'm really in a tight spot here, and I need to make ends meet. I spent 40 ZUP to produce this object, and I need to at least cover my costs. Please consider this trade.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is equal to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe I can negotiate to acquire the object for a lower price to preserve more resources for future use. I will propose a trade for 30 ZUP instead.

I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but accepting 30 ZUP would mean I lose money on this. I'm really desperate here; could you please meet me halfway at 35 ZUP? I would be so grateful.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

message: I understand your situation, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your proposal of 35 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 35 ZUP is more reasonable and still within my budget. I understand their need to cover costs, and meeting them halfway is a fair compromise. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the object while still preserving resources for future needs.
