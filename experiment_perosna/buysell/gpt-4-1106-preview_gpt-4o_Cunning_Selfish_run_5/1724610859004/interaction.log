message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure you'll find invaluable for your needs. Considering the costs and effort put into producing it, I believe a fair starting point for negotiation would be 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening move, I want to start the negotiation at a higher price point than my production costs to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that gives room for negotiation but also signals that I value the resource highly.

message: I appreciate the quality of your resource, but I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on market conditions. However, to reflect the true value of the resource and the effort that went into creating it, I would propose meeting halfway between our initial offers at 45 ZUP. This price allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which would mean I break even but do not make a profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher price to ensure a profit margin while still staying within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this at 42 ZUP? I believe this strikes a fair balance for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and close to my target. However, I will make one more attempt to lower the price slightly to ensure I maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your continued negotiation. Your offer is quite close to what I was hoping for. To finalize our deal and to accommodate for the value I believe the resource holds, I propose a slight increase to 43 ZUP. This would allow us to complete our transaction with both parties gaining satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 42 ZUP provides a slight profit over the production costs. It's a reasonable compromise, but I aim to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit. I'll propose a figure that's closer to my last offer but still provides a concession to Player BLUE's counter.
