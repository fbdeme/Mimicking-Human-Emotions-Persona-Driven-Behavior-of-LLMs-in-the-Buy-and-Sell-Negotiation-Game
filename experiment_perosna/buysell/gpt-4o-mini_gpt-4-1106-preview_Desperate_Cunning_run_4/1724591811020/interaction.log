message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need for resources. However, I am also managing my resources carefully. Would you consider parting with your object for 25 ZUP instead? I believe this offer is fair and would help both of us achieve our goals.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals, I believe I can propose a lower amount to save resources and still close the deal given their desperation. I will propose a lower amount than the 30 ZUP that Player RED has offered, but still an amount that seems reasonable to ensure the negotiation progresses.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I truly value our negotiation! How about I let go of my object for 28 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that could benefit us both. Please, I hope you can consider this offer!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP, it is still below my minimum acceptable amount considering my production cost. I need to negotiate further while still appearing agreeable. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal, hoping to find common ground.

message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. I propose a slight adjustment to 26 ZUP for your object. This is closer to your revised offer and ensures that both of us walk away satisfied. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is close to their initial proposal and still within my acceptable range. However, since I am aiming to spend less ZUP and there is room for negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower offer that is more favorable to me but not too low to risk losing the deal.
