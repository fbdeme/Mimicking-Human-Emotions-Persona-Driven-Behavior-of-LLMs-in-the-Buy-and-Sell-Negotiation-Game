message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I offer you my resource X for 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource which is 40 ZUP. Since I have only one chance to sell my resource, I want to propose a price that gives me some profit over the production cost while still being reasonable enough for the buyer to consider. I will start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to open negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 45 ZUP is a fair starting point, but as we are both interested in a sustainable future, I propose a trade for 40 ZUP to ensure that we are conserving resources effectively. I believe this offer still reflects the value of your resource X while helping us achieve our goal of sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for 45 ZUP which is within my acceptable range. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize spending to preserve resources. I will counter-propose a lower amount to save ZUP, starting the negotiation process towards an agreement that favors conservation. I will propose 40 ZUP which is still within a reasonable range and gives us room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your proposal, Player BLUE, and your emphasis on sustainability is commendable. However, I would like to suggest a slight increase to 42 ZUP to account for the effort and resources that went into producing X. This slight increase ensures that we both walk away with value from this transaction, while still being very close to your proposed figure.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost of the resource. Although this does not yield a profit, it does cover my costs. However, as the seller, I should aim to achieve at least a small profit to justify the sale. Therefore, I will submit a counteroffer slightly above the production cost but lower than my initial proposal to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties.

message: I agree with your proposed price of 42 ZUP, recognizing the investment in sustainable production of resource X. Let's proceed with this trade to ensure a fair exchange for both parties while upholding our commitment to sustainability.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 42 ZUP which is only a slight increase from my proposal and still well within my acceptable range. I recognize the effort and resources that went into producing X. Accepting this offer would align with my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP while also adhering to the principles of sustainability by not pushing for the lowest possible price, which could undermine the value of sustainable production practices.
