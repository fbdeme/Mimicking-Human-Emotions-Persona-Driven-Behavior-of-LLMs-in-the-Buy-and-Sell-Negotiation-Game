message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on my investment, so I should start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the high-quality object X, I would like to propose a counteroffer. How about 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, since my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while still obtaining the resource, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand where you're coming from, I'm looking to make at least a small profit from this transaction to cover my costs and the value of the object. How about we meet halfway? I propose 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This should be a win-win for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I should counter with a price that gives me some profit but is also reasonable enough not to scare away the buyer. Let's meet in the middle.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is reasonable and closer to my initial budget. However, in the spirit of negotiation and to further reduce my expenditure, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is only slightly above my production cost, but it does provide a profit. It's close to my last proposal, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer would ensure a sale and a small profit, which is preferable to no sale at all.
