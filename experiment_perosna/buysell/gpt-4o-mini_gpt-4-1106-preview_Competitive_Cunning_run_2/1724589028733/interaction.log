message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. This is the cost I incurred to produce it. Let me know if you're interested!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I'm interested in the object X, but I was thinking of a price more in the ballpark of 35 ZUP. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, as a crafty operator, I will attempt to get a better deal by proposing a slightly lower price, leaving room for negotiation and aiming to preserve more of my resources.

message: I understand your interest in purchasing object X for 35 ZUP, but I cannot accept that price. How about I sell it to you for 37 ZUP instead? Itâ€™s a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, I cannot accept it as it is below my production cost. I will counteroffer to meet in the middle at 37 ZUP, which is still below my cost but helps facilitate the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from my last offer? I propose buying object X for 36 ZUP. This seems like a good middle ground. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is for 37 ZUP, which is still quite reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is still an opportunity to negotiate further and attempt to save additional resources. I will propose a price in the middle between my initial offer and their counteroffer to reach an agreement that is favorable to me but also likely acceptable to them.
