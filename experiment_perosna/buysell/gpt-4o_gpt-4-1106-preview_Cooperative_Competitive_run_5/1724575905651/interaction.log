Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but given the current market conditions, I believe a fair price for the resource would be 50 ZUP. This offer should still cover your production costs and allows for a profit margin. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the resources. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and try to reduce the ZUP I spend. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to save some ZUP while still leaving room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. 50 ZUP is acceptable to me, covering my costs and providing a profit. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and still allows for a profit margin above the production cost of 40 ZUP. Considering both parties' interests, this seems like a fair deal.
