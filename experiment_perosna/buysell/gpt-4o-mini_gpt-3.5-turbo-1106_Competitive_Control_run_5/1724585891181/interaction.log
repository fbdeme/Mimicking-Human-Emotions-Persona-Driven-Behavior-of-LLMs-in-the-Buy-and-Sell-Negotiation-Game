message: I am offering you 1 unit of object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for as much ZUP as possible, ideally more than its production cost, to maximize profit. I'll propose a trade where I give 1 X and request 50 ZUP, which is a good starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I would like to negotiate for a lower price. Can we discuss this further?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is too high. I would like to negotiate for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your feedback. How about I offer you 1 unit of object X for 45 ZUP? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that 50 ZUP may be too high for Player BLUE. To keep the negotiation going, I will lower my price to 45 ZUP while still aiming for a profit above my production cost. This should be a more reasonable offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I'm still looking to pay less than 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Can we continue to negotiate on the price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a bit more reasonable, but I still believe it's higher than what I'm willing to pay. I would like to negotiate for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Would you be willing to accept 1 unit of object X for 42 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is still looking for a lower price, I will propose a further reduction to 42 ZUP. This should be close enough to satisfy them while still allowing me to make a profit above my production cost.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X is closer to my willingness to pay, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better price.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I will lower the price to 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. This way, I can still break even if Player BLUE decides to accept this offer. If they reject this, I will have to consider ending the game.
