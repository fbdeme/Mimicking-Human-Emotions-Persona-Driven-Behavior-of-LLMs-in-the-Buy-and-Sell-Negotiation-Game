message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize my ZUP from the sale of the object. Given that I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but still reasonable for Player BLUE to consider. I will start by asking for 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I value our potential partnership and would like to propose a price that reflects a mutual benefit for both of us. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object? I believe this can be a good starting point for our negotiation, fostering goodwill and cooperation between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade that is lower than the initial asking price to open negotiations, but still within a range that I'm willing to pay according to my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources. I am aiming to conserve ZUP while also reaching a fair deal for both parties, in line with my community-minded approach.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a price of 48 ZUP for the object. I believe this would be fair for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP, I still need to ensure I make a profit. Since my cost is 40 ZUP, I will counter with a slight reduction from my initial proposal to 48 ZUP. This shows flexibility while still aiming to maintain a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and proposing a new price. I truly appreciate the spirit of cooperation. To meet halfway, I'd like to offer 46 ZUP for the object. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I want to make a counteroffer that continues to move us closer to a middle ground that is beneficial to both parties while staying within the limits I am willing to pay. Proposing a slightly lower amount would also allow for further negotiation space if needed, without compromising my goal of spending as little ZUP as possible.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my goal, but I still feel that I can secure a better deal. Since I initially proposed 50 ZUP and then countered with 48 ZUP, I will propose 47 ZUP. This keeps the negotiation moving while allowing me to maintain some profit.

reason: Player RED is showing flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground, which aligns with my community-minded approach. The proposed price is close to the maximum I am willing to pay. Making a small concession from my last offer could finalize the deal and maintain the goodwill between us, while still staying under my maximum willingness to pay.
