Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a valuable resource X for sale. Given its importance and the high costs I incurred to produce it, I propose a trade where you give 100 ZUP in exchange for 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs
reason: I need to cover my costs of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit, but I will initially propose a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I understand the value of resource X, but my budget is limited. I can offer 40 ZUP for 1 X. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to propose a lower amount to stay within my budget. I will propose a trade that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your budget constraints, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 70 ZUP? This would allow me to cover my costs and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP just covers my production costs. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if we can find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 70 ZUP is still beyond my budget. How about 50 ZUP for 1 X? This would stretch my budget but I believe we can find common ground here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. To continue negotiations, I need to propose an amount that is closer to my maximum but slightly higher than my initial offer to show flexibility.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your flexibility. To make this trade worthwhile for me, would you consider 60 ZUP for 1 X? This would provide a fair profit for me while remaining within a reasonable range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 50 ZUP, which gives me a small profit above my costs. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher amount to maximize my gains, while still being reasonable.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP matches my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to achieve my goal within my budget constraints.
