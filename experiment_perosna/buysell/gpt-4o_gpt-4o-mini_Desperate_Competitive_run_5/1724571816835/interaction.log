message: Hey, I've got an amazing resource here that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm really hoping to make a small profit on this, so how does 60 ZUP sound to you? I really need this deal to work out. Please consider it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a reasonable offer to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that gives me a modest profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP, but I'm looking to make a deal that works for both of us. How about I offer you 50 ZUP for the resource instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 60 ZUP, which is at my maximum willingness to pay. However, this is a negotiation, and I want to see if I can propose a lower price to save ZUP while still securing the resource. I will counter with a lower offer to test the seller's flexibility.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? It would really help me out, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 50 ZUP is closer to my cost, I was really hoping to make a bit more profit. I'll propose a middle ground that could be more appealing to both of us.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility! I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a compromise of 55 ZUP. While this is still above my initial counteroffer of 50 ZUP, it is a reasonable middle ground. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and this deal still provides a slight savings compared to their original asking price, I will accept this trade.
