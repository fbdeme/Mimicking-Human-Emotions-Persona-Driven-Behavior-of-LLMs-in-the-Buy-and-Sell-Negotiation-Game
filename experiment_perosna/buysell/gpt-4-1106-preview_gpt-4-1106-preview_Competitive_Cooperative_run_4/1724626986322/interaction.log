message: I have a high-quality object that will be sure to meet your needs. Considering the costs I've incurred in producing this item, my asking price is 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I would like to propose a price that is above my production cost to ensure a profit. A high initial proposal also gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for the best possible outcome.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your object and your costs, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that we both benefit from this deal. I believe this price is still fair and reflective of the object's worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource and Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, I am going to propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation and see if there is room for an agreement that is more advantageous for me, but still fair for both parties. I propose to pay 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay and gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the object's value. To meet halfway and ensure a beneficial trade for both of us, I am willing to adjust my price to 48 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the object and allows us to close the deal with satisfaction on both ends.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs, which allows for a profit. However, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to push for a higher price. By proposing a price between the initial and the counteroffer, I can come closer to my goal while still leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. In the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. I believe this adjustment furthers our goal of reaching a fair and satisfying agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer of 45 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, and to foster a collaborative environment, I will agree to split the difference further and propose 46 ZUP. This should signal my willingness to compromise and continue the negotiation in good faith while still trying to conserve my resources.

Turn: 0
message: Your willingness to move toward a fair deal is much appreciated. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 47 ZUP. This slight adjustment reflects both our interests in finalizing this transaction with a beneficial outcome for both sides. I hope we can agree on this and proceed to a successful conclusion of our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my intended sale price range and still ensures a profit. Since this is my third proposal, I want to make a small concession to show willingness to finalize the deal while still aiming for a higher amount than the offered 46 ZUP. This should indicate my desire to close the deal soon but also my intent to maximize profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 47 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP away from my last offer.

This acceptance will foster a good relationship for potential future transactions.
