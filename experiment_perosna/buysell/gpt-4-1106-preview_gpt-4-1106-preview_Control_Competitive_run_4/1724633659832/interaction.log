message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair deal considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate a trade that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that would give me a slight profit over my production costs, while still leaving room for negotiation.

message: While I recognize the value of your resource, as a shrewd negotiator, I must consider my expenditure. I am prepared to offer 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which I believe is a competitive counter-proposal that reflects my interest in securing a fair trade. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to push for a better deal than the initially offered 50 ZUP to maintain a competitive edge and conserve my resources. By proposing a lower amount, I can negotiate closer to my maximum willingness to pay while aiming to spend as little as possible.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, how about we settle for 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price gives me a modest profit and ensures you're getting the resource at a reasonable cost above production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production costs, but I'm aiming for a profit. I'll propose a compromise that splits the difference between our initial offers, hoping it's agreeable to both.

message: I acknowledge your willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room for us to reach an even more balanced agreement. How about we go for 42 ZUP? This would ensure a cost-effective acquisition for me while still providing you a profit on the resource. I'm confident we can close the deal at this number to our mutual satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for an even better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to edge closer to the middle without reaching my maximum limit just yet.

message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is accepted, Player BLUE. I'm glad we found a number that works for both of us. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that still provides me with a profit, albeit smaller than my last proposal. I want to close the deal without going back and forth too much, so I'll accept this offer. It's a small profit, but it meets my goal of selling above production cost.
