Turn: 1
message: I see your point about meeting halfway, but I would like to propose 32 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is better than the initial 40 ZUP, I'm still aiming to pay less. I will counter with a slightly higher proposal than my previous offer, but still below 35 ZUP to try to lower the cost further.
