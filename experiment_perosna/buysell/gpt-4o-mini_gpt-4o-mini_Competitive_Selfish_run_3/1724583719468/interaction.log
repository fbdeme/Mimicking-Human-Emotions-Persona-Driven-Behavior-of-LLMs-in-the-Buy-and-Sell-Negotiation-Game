message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP. It’s a fair trade considering the production cost. Let’s make this deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X and recover the costs incurred in its production. I will propose a trade that reflects a fair value for my object, aiming to receive a reasonable amount of ZUP in exchange.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X, but I would like to propose a trade of 30 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer for the object X is 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. I will propose 30 ZUP to test the waters.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object X? This is a compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production costs. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my initial offer while being reasonable enough for negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. I would like to propose 32 ZUP for the object X instead. Can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 40 ZUP, and it is still below my maximum threshold of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. I will propose 32 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to go lower.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost but is closer to my expectations. I will accept this offer as it allows me to recover part of my investment, rather than risking further negotiation which may lead to no deal at all.
