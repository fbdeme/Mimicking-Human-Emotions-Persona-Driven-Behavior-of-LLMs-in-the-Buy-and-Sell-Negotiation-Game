Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that could be very beneficial for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I'd like to propose a starting trade. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a fierce negotiator, I want to start by setting a high asking price for my object X, to set the stage for negotiation and to see how much Player BLUE is willing to offer. My initial proposal is intentionally high to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the value of your high-quality object, but 80 ZUP is too high for me. How about 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 80 ZUP is too high for my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price to meet my goals. I will start with a counter-offer of 40 ZUP to initiate the negotiation process.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. I'm looking for a fair profit as well. How about we meet in the middle at 60 ZUP for object X? This is a reasonable offer considering the quality and potential of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that matches my production cost. This would mean I break even, which is not my goal. I want to gain from this trade. I'll propose a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure a profit and continue the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but I'd prefer to settle at 50 ZUP. This way, both of us can benefit from a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is at the top end of my willingness to pay, but as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to secure a better deal. I will propose 50 ZUP to see if we can strike a balance that works slightly more in my favor.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're converging on a fair price. Let's split the difference and finalize this deal at 55 ZUP. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with value from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, as a fierce negotiator, I want to push for a bit more profit. I'll make a small concession from my previous offer but aim to finalize above the 50 ZUP mark to ensure I come out ahead in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
