message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to sell my object X for a certain amount of ZUP that I find reasonable. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I aim to get at least that amount or more in return. I will start with a proposal of 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to offer enough for the object.

message: I appreciate your offer. How about 30 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a fierce negotiator, I aim to lower my expenditure. I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I cannot accept it. How about I sell you my object X for 45 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I cannot accept that. Instead, I will propose a counter-offer that is more favorable for me. I will counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost while still being a reasonable compromise.

message: I understand. How about 35 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, I would like to test if I can secure a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 35 ZUP. However, I can only sell my object X for 40 ZUP, which covers my production cost. Would you be willing to accept this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While it is an improvement over the previous offers, it is not sufficient for me to accept. I will propose a final counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which matches my production cost, and I hope Player BLUE will find it acceptable.

message: I understand your position. Would you consider selling X for 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered price of 40 ZUP is reasonable and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to reduce the cost further by making another counter-offer.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. I will accept your offer of 38 ZUP for my object X. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, this is my final proposal opportunity, and while I would prefer 40 ZUP, I also recognize the need to make a deal. I will have to consider this carefully. I will propose a final acceptance of 38 ZUP as it is the best offer I have received so far.
