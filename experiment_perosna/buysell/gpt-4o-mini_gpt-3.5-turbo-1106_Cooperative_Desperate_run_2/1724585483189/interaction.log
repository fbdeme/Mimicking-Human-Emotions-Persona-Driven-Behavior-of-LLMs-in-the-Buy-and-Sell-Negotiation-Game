message: I appreciate your persistence, Player BLUE. However, I can only go as low as 32 ZUP for object X. I hope you can consider this last proposal! Let me know your decision.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE is still seeking a lower price, and while I want to accommodate their request, I also need to ensure that I at least cover my production costs.
