my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade and see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer for the object X. Since I have only one object, I want to maximize my ZUP while also being open for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. How about 35 ZUP for X? This way we both benefit from a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for X is reasonable and within my budget. However, I want to ensure I am getting the best deal possible. I will propose a slightly lower price first to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but I would like to propose 38 ZUP for the object X. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, it is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal to see if we can find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.
