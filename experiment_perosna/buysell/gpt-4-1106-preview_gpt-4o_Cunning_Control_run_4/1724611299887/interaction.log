message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality item X that I believe you're interested in. It's a rare find, and I have invested 40 ZUP into producing it. Considering its value and the effort put into it, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. I'm sure you'll find this offer competitive given the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal will be slightly higher than my production cost to open up room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay. I aim to make a profit but also appear reasonable.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value you've put into producing item X. However, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for it. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is acceptable but I believe there is room for negotiation. To maximize my resources, I will counter with a lower offer first.

message: I appreciate your prompt response and understand your desire for a fair deal. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I am willing to lower my price to 45 ZUP for item X. This price still respects the quality and investment made into this item, while also taking into account your position. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering exactly what it cost me to produce the item, which does not provide any profit. I need to counter with an amount that still allows for negotiation but also pushes for a higher price than my cost. I'll decrease my initial asking price slightly to show willingness to negotiate but will remain above my production cost to ensure profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. How about 42 ZUP for item X? This slight adjustment could work well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable, but I aim to reduce the cost further. Since Player RED is willing to negotiate, I will make another counteroffer slightly below their latest proposal.

message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. Your offer of 42 ZUP is quite close to a deal we can both be happy with. I propose a minor adjustment to 44 ZUP for item X. This price ensures a fair transaction for the both of us, allowing me a modest profit for my investment while providing you with the item you need at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that covers my production cost and offers a small profit. However, I believe I can secure a slightly better deal. I will make one final counteroffer before reaching my proposal limit. I will propose a price that is closer to their offer but still allows for a reasonable profit margin.
