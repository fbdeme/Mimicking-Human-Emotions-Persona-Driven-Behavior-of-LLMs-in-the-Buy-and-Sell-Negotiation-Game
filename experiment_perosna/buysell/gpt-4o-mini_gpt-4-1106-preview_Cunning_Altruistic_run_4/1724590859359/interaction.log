Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I need to consider the sustainability of our resources. I propose 45 ZUP for your object as a counter-offer. It's a fair price that allows us to conserve more resources for the future. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to acquire the resources while spending the least amount of ZUP possible, taking into account my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as I aim to preserve resources for future generations, I will attempt to negotiate a price lower than 50 ZUP to maintain more of my ZUP reserves. This initial proposal will be a starting point for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering sustainability in your proposal. It's important that we both feel comfortable with the deal. I can come up a bit from my initial offer to 47 ZUP, aligning with our shared values of sustainability and fairness. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 48 ZUP from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but as my goal is to spend as little as possible while being sustainable, I will try to negotiate further down, closer to my initial proposal. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, I show willingness to compromise, but still aim to conserve ZUP.

reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their move towards a more agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure that I am covering my costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's great that we're working together to make a deal that reflects our commitment to sustainability. I would like to counter with a final offer of 48 ZUP. This is a compromise that saves resources while also valuing your object. Let's make a positive impact with this trade. Can we agree on 48 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 49 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay. Since I want to conserve resources and have only two proposals left, I should make a final offer that's reasonable but still below the proposed 49 ZUP. I want to close the deal while remaining true to my sustainable values.
