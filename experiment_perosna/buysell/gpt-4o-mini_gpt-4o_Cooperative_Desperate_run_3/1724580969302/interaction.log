message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but unfortunately, my funds are quite limited. Would you be willing to accept 30 ZUP instead?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I want to try to get a better deal to conserve my resources. Given my strategy to appear desperate, I will offer a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down.

message: How about I lower my asking price to 35 ZUP? I hope this can work for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
