message: Oh please, I worked so hard to produce this object. It cost me 40 ZUP, and I really need to make a profit to make ends meet. I'm asking for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high price to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a price of 100 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you worked hard on this object and need to make a profit, but the price is beyond my budget. I can only pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. Can we negotiate a lower price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 100 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I need to propose a trade that aligns with my budget and allows me to engage in negotiation without immediately accepting such a high price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 100 ZUP is too high for you. How about 80 ZUP? I'm really in a tight spot and need to make a decent profit. Please help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 60 ZUP is above my production cost but lower than my initial proposal. I need to continue negotiating to find a middle ground. Since I still have room for more proposals, I will propose 80 ZUP to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, but 80 ZUP is still beyond what I can offer. My maximum budget is 60 ZUP. Is there any way we can meet at that price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 80 ZUP, but it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. While I appreciate the effort to negotiate, I cannot accept this offer. I need to propose a counter-offer that fits within my budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your understanding. Can we settle at 70 ZUP? I'm begging you, I'm really in need of just a bit more to cover my costs and make a small profit. Please consider it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firm on their maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Since I still have room for negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower price of 70 ZUP to see if they can stretch their budget a bit more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly empathize with your situation, but 70 ZUP is still beyond my limit. I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can reach an agreement at that price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made another attempt to negotiate, lowering the price to 70 ZUP. While this is an improvement, it is still above my budget of 60 ZUP. I appreciate their situation, but I must remain within my financial limits. Therefore, I need to reject this offer and propose my maximum budget as a final attempt.
