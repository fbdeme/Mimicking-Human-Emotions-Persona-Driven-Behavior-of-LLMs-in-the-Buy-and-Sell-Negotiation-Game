my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I can only offer 52 ZUP for the object. I hope we can make a deal at that price!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 55 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 60 ZUP, I still believe I can push for a better deal. Since I proposed 50 ZUP initially, I will stick to my strategy and propose a counteroffer that is closer to my original offer.

message: Thank you for your offer of 52 ZUP. Would you consider 54 ZUP? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 52 ZUP is close to my last proposal and still provides a reasonable profit margin. Accepting this offer would be a good outcome. However, I will attempt one last proposal to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

message: I accept your offer of 54 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 54 ZUP is better than my last proposal of 52 ZUP, and itâ€™s still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Since I am still within my budget and this is a fair compromise, I will accept this trade.
