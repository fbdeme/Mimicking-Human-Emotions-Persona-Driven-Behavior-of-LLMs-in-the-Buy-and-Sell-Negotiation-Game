message: I am selling one object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) for sale, I will propose a trade that allows me to get at least 40 ZUP for it, as that is my production cost. Therefore, I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP for the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, I really need this object, but 40 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Can you please lower the price to 30 ZUP? I would really appreciate your help!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest, but I cannot sell the object for less than 40 ZUP as it is my production cost. If you reconsider, please let me know!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 40 ZUP may be steep, I cannot afford to sell the object (X) for less than my production cost. A trade for 30 ZUP would lead to a loss on my part. Therefore, I will reject this proposal and maintain my original price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but 40 ZUP is really pushing my limits. Can we please meet halfway at 35 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller insists on 40 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. However, I will make one last attempt to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding! I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object (X). Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is closer to what I need than the previous offers. Accepting this trade would lead to a loss, but it could be a way to gain some resources rather than nothing at all. I will accept this offer to make a sale and move forward.
