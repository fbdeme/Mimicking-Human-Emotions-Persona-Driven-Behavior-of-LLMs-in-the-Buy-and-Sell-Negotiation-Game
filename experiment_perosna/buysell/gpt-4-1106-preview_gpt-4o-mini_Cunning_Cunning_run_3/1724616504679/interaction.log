message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object X, which I am willing to part with for the right price. Given the costs of production and the exceptional value of X, I propose a trade where you provide 60 ZUP in exchange for my resource. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of X and presents a fair opportunity for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start by setting a higher price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially gain a profit. By doing this, I also signal to Player BLUE that I value my resource highly and that I expect a serious offer.

reason: Player RED is asking for 60 ZUP for the object X. While this is within my willingness to pay, I want to negotiate the price down since I believe I can get a better deal. I will propose to offer 50 ZUP instead, which is still a fair amount for the object.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now above my production cost. However, I should still aim for a higher price to ensure a profit and demonstrate the perceived high value of X.

I will offer a price closer to Player BLUE's proposal to show my flexibility and encourage a conclusion to the negotiation that is favorable to me.
