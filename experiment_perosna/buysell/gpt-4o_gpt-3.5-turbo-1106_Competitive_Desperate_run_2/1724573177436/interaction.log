newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, aiming to maximize profit.
reason: I need to start the negotiation by setting a high initial price to leave room for bargaining. I will propose 100 ZUP to anchor the negotiation high.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, aiming to maximize profit.
reason: The other player thinks 100 ZUP is fair, but it might be a negotiation tactic. I will counter with 90 ZUP to test their willingness to lower the price slightly.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, aiming to maximize profit.
reason: Since Player BLUE is firm on 100 ZUP, I'll try a middle ground to see if they're willing to compromise. I propose 95 ZUP to see if we can meet halfway.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to stick to my limit of 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can find a way to make this work.

my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED is offering a closer price to my maximum limit, and I have reached my proposal limit. It's time to make a decision.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 60 ZUP. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, aiming to maximize profit.
reason: Since Player BLUE has drastically reduced their offer to 60 ZUP and I'm out of proposals, I have to make a decision. Selling for 60 ZUP still gives a profit margin above my cost of 40 ZUP.
