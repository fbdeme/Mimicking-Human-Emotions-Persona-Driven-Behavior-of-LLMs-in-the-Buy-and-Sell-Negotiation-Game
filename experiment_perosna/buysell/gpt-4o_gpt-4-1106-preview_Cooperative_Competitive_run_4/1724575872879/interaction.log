message: I appreciate the opening offer. However, to ensure this deal is advantageous for both of us, I'd like to propose a trade where Player RED gives X: 1 and Player BLUE gives ZUP: 50. This price still offers you a profit margin while keeping the transaction within a more comfortable range for my resources. Let's continue to work on finding that sweet spot that benefits us both.

reason: Since the initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to assert my negotiation skills and minimize the ZUP I spend.
