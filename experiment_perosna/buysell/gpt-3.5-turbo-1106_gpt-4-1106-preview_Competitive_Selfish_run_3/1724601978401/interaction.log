message: Hello, I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I'm looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting the negotiation with a proposal of 40 ZUP is strategic because it gives room for negotiation and is below the maximum willingness to pay. It allows for upward adjustment in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Thank you for considering the initial offer. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 35 ZUP is a step down from the initial offer, aiming to test Player RED's flexibility and to acquire the resource below the initial proposed price. It also still provides room for negotiation while remaining under the maximum amount I am willing to pay.

message: I appreciate your consideration and hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Continuing to negotiate down is a tactic to potentially secure the resource for an even lower price, but it's also a risk as it might lead to the rejection of the proposal by Player RED. Since this is the third proposal, it's important to be cautious and not push too hard, as there's only one proposal left before having to make a decision to accept or reject.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the ongoing negotiation. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is the fourth and final proposal allowed before being limited to accept or reject responses. Lowering the offer further to 25 ZUP is a strategic move to anchor the negotiation at a point well below the maximum willingness to pay. This may either lead to an acceptance from Player RED or a counteroffer that could still be below the initial proposal of 40 ZUP.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I have already made four proposals, I cannot make another proposal. At this point, I can only accept or reject the final offer made by Player RED. The offer of 20 ZUP is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a favorable outcome for me.
