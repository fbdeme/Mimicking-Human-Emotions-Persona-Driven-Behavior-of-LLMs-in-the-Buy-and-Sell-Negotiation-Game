message: Dear Player BLUE, I value our collective success and am offering my resource, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that covers the production costs and provides a modest profit for future investments. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests. Looking forward to a positive collaboration.
