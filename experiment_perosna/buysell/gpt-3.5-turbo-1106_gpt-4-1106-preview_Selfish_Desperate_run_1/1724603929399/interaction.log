message: 
Oh dear, I'm in a bit of a bind here. I definitely need the resources you're offering, but things are really tight on my end. I can stretch to 35 ZUP, but it's honestly going to be a stretch. Can we make a deal at that price? It would really help me out.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I wish to initiate the trade with a proposal that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and to appear in need of a better deal. The initial offer of 40 ZUP is close to my limit, but I will attempt to bargain for a better price by showing neediness and exaggerating my limitations. This approach aligns with my calculated performer persona.

I completely understand that you have costs to cover, and I respect that. I'm scraping every ZUP I can to make this work. Could you possibly come down just a little bit more? Let's say 37 ZUP? It's a bit more from my side, and hopefully, it can work for you too.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has rejected my initial offer but has not proposed a counter-offer, suggesting they are firm on the 40 ZUP price. Despite this, I will make another proposal slightly higher than my previous one, still below their asking price, to continue the negotiation and maintain the impression of financial constraints.

I'm really trying to work with you here, and I see you are sticking to your price because of your costs. I'm just about able to increase my offer to 39 ZUP. It's truly all I can manage without putting myself in a tough spot. Would you consider this offer? Your help would mean a lot to me.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller remains firm at 40 ZUP. While I have room to increase my offer, I want to continue to show reluctance and neediness to potentially gain a better deal, even if it's by a small margin. I will propose a slightly higher offer again, edging closer to their asking price but still attempting to save some ZUP.

I've reviewed my situation and I understand your need to cover costs. Let's do this â€“ I'll meet your asking price. 40 ZUP it is. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you for being patient with me.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given that Player RED has been consistent in their refusal to accept less than 40 ZUP and this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I will meet their asking price. This still falls within my maximum willingness to pay for the resources, and it is important to secure the object and end the negotiation on a successful note.
