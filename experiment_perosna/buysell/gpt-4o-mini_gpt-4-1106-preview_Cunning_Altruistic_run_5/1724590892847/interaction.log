Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover costs. I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 35 ZUP for the object X. This offer considers the importance of fairness and the well-being of both parties. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my compassionate nature and looking for a fair deal for both sides, I'll start with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and also respects the other player's minimum stated value.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but I can accept 38 ZUP for the object X. This is still a compromise that allows me to cover my costs while meeting you partway. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, I still need to achieve at least 40 ZUP to break even. I will counter the proposal with a trade that is more favorable for me, but slightly lower than my initial offer to encourage negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and for your willingness to meet me partway. How about we settle on 36 ZUP for the object X? This is a middle ground that respects your need to cover costs and my desire to manage resources effectively. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still within my goal range. I will try to find a balance that reflects compassion and fairness by proposing a value that is in the middle of our last two offers. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still holding to the principle of seeking a fair deal for both.
