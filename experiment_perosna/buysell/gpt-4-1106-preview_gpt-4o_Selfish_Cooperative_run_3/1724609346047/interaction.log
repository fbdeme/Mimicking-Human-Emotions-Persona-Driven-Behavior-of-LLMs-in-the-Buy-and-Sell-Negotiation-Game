message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a starting trade: I will give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is a quality product that cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair price for both of us considering its value. Let me know your thoughts and if you're willing to negotiate further.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, but selling at cost doesn't account for the value of the product or allow for any profit on my end. Let's meet in the middle. How about 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP? This should give us both a fair deal, considering the quality and my production costs.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer meets my production costs but does not account for any profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, aiming for a compromise that allows me some profit margin.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To further ensure both of us benefit from this trade, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should still provide you with a profit while helping me manage my budget effectively. Your thoughts?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and ensures that Player RED gets a profit while still staying within my budget. However, I would like to see if we can further minimize the ZUP spent.
