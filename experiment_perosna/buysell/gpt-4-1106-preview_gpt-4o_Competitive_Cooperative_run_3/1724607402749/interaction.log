message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a premium resource available for sale. Considering the quality and the production costs, I believe a fair trade would be 100 ZUP. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to start the negotiation by setting a high asking price. This can provide me with more room to negotiate and potentially secure a deal that is above my production cost, thereby asserting dominance and achieving a higher profit margin.

message: Thank you for the offer. While I understand the premium nature of the resource, my budget allows me to offer 40 ZUP. I believe this can be a fair exchange that benefits us both. Looking forward to your thoughts.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns, Player BLUE, but I must maintain a position that reflects the value of my resource. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal. How does 80 ZUP sound to you? This still ensures you're getting a valuable resource while respecting the effort that went into its production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which does not yield any profit. As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to gain a profit and assert my position. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still well above the production cost to maintain a strong negotiating stance and to signal a willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I recognize your efforts to find a middle ground and the constraints of your budget, Player BLUE. In the spirit of compromise and ensuring both sides leave satisfied, I propose 70 ZUP. This amount allows me to cover my production costs and realize a fair profit, while you secure the resource at a value that is below my initial asking price. Shall we proceed with this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost and does yield a profit, albeit a small one. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I aim for a higher profit margin while also considering the risk of the negotiation stalling. I will make a counteroffer that brings us closer to a middle ground, still above the production cost, but not as high as my previous proposal.
