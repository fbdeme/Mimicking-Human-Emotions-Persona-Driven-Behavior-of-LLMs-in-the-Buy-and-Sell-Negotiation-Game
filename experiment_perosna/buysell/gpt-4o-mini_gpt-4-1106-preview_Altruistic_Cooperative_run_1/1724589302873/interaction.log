message: I have one object X for sale. I propose you buy it for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a reasonable trade that values the resource I have and minimizes ZUP spending while still being attractive to Player BLUE. Since I have only one object, I'll propose to sell it for 30 ZUP, which is below the production cost but reasonable for a starting point.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object, but I would like to propose a new trade where I provide 25 ZUP in exchange for the object. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goal range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. However, as a skilled negotiator, I aim to foster cooperation and potentially reduce the ZUP expenditure without undermining the value that Player RED might be seeking. I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation process and see if Player RED is open to a more favorable deal.

message: I appreciate your interest, but I can't accept 25 ZUP. How about I sell you the object for 28 ZUP instead? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest in the object, the proposed 25 ZUP is below my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a loss, as my resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Therefore, I will propose a counter-trade of 28 ZUP to get closer to my goal while still being reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: I am glad to see that we are working towards an agreement. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 26 ZUP for the object. This is a slight increase from my initial offer, reflecting my genuine interest in the object while also taking into account your asking price. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counteroffered with a price closer to their initial proposal, which is still within my acceptable range. I can either choose to accept this offer or attempt to negotiate further. Considering my role as a diplomatic negotiator, I will try to propose a middle ground that could be beneficial for both parties and continue the cooperative approach.

message: Thank you for your continued interest! How about I sell you the object for 27 ZUP? I think this is a fair compromise between our previous offers. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 26 ZUP is still below my previous proposal of 28 ZUP. While I appreciate the increase, I am still at a loss if I accept this offer considering my production costs. I will propose a final counteroffer of 27 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and moves closer to my initial asking price while still reflecting Player BLUE's interest.

reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise that is just slightly above my last proposal and well within my budget. As a diplomatic negotiator, it's important to know when to continue negotiating and when to seal the deal. Accepting this offer would not only show good faith in the negotiation process but also secure the object for a fair price, aligning with my goal to foster cooperation.
