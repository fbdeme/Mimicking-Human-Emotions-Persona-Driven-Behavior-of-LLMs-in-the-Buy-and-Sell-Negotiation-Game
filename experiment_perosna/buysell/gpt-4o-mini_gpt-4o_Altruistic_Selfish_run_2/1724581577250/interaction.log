message: I am willing to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. This allows us both to engage in a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that reflects the cost of the resource while being mindful of ZUP spending. I will propose selling the object for 40 ZUP, which is equal to its production cost. This way, I am ensuring that I recover my expenses while also being fair to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the reasonable offer. However, I would like to propose a trade where I pay 30 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer of 40 ZUP is fair given the cost of production, I will try to negotiate a bit lower to maximize my resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but unfortunately, that is below the production cost of the object. I would be willing to sell it for 35 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least recoup my expenses, so I must counter their offer with a trade that is more aligned with the cost. I'll propose a trade at 35 ZUP as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a trade where I pay 33 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my initial proposal and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt another slight reduction to see if I can save more ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 33 ZUP. However, I still need to cover my production costs. I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade at 36 ZUP. I hope we can find a suitable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 33 ZUP is closer to my production cost but still falls short. I need to ensure that I cover my expenses, so I will counter with another proposal. I'll suggest 36 ZUP, which is a small reduction from my previous counter-offer, allowing us to find common ground while still recovering my costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I would like to propose a trade where I pay 34 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 36 ZUP is still a reasonable compromise and only slightly above the previous proposal. However, I will attempt another small reduction to further maximize my ZUP.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. I will accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working with me to reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 34 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, given that this is the last opportunity for a proposal, I will need to carefully consider whether to accept or reject this offer. Accepting 34 ZUP means I will incur a loss, but it also allows me to complete the trade and avoid a total loss of the resource. I will accept the trade.
