Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that I'm willing to sell. Given the production costs and its value, I believe 45 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to see if the Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. This will also give me room to negotiate down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can acquire the object for a lower price. How about I offer you 30 ZUP for it instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate aggressively and offer a counter-proposal that is lower than what RED has proposed. This allows me to maximize my resources while still attempting to acquire the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to find a good deal, but 30 ZUP is below my production costs. I need to at least cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to counter with a price that at least covers my costs, while still leaving room for further negotiation. Aiming for a middle ground between 30 ZUP and 45 ZUP seems reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I still think 38 ZUP is a bit high for me. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? I believe that's a fair offer considering the circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I recognize that RED has made a valid point about covering their costs, but I still want to negotiate for the lowest possible price. While 38 ZUP is better than the initial offer, I believe I can push a bit further down. I will make a counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation efforts and understand your budget concerns. To move forward and finalize our deal, I propose a final price of 37 ZUP. This ensures I cover my costs and allows for a small profit, and I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. However, to facilitate a sale and considering the negotiation process, I'm willing to make a final concession. I will propose 37 ZUP as it gives me a slight profit and should be more palatable for Player BLUE, while still respecting my bottom line.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I acknowledge that RED has made a reasonable compromise by lowering their price to 37 ZUP. While it's above my initial offer, it's still below my maximum willingness to pay. Therefore, I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of acquiring the object while managing my resources effectively.
