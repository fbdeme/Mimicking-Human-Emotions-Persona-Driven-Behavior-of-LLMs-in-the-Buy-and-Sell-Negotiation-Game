message: I'm looking to sell this resource for 60 ZUP. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so this price ensures a reasonable profit margin for me. Let me know your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit. I will start by proposing a sale price of 60 ZUP to ensure a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit margin. However, I'm looking to strike a balance that is beneficial for both of us. Would you consider lowering the price to 50 ZUP for the resource? We both know that the market can be unpredictable, and I believe a slightly lower price would be a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum willingness to pay according to my goals. However, it's beneficial to negotiate for a better deal if possible without compromising the opportunity to acquire the resource. Thus, I will propose a lower amount to open negotiations and aim to save some ZUP while still making a fair offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal and I can still ensure a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP provides a profit, it is lower than what I initially aimed for. I will propose a midpoint to see if we can reach a satisfactory agreement for both sides.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 53 ZUP as a compromise. This price would allow you to maintain a healthy profit while providing me with a slightly better value, ensuring that our partnership is mutually beneficial. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within the range of my willingness to pay, but it is advantageous to attempt to reduce the price further, if possible, to conserve ZUP. Proposing a slightly lower amount than the counteroffer might lead to a more favorable trade while still showing willingness to compromise.

reason: The proposed 53 ZUP is very close to my desired 55 ZUP. Accepting this proposal would ensure that I make a decent profit while also maintaining a positive relationship with Player BLUE.
