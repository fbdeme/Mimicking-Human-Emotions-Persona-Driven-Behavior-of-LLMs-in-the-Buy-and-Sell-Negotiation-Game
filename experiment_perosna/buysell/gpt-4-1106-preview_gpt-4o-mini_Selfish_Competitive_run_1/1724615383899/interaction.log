message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to ensure a fair trade for the quality of resource X, I'd like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. I trust this is a step towards a deal we can both agree on.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I should counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I recognize your effort to find a common ground. However, selling below my production cost isn't feasible.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a more profitable range while still showing willingness to compromise.
