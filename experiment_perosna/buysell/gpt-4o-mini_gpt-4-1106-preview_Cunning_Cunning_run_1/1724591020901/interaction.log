message: I have one object X that I am willing to sell for 30 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I see your offer for 30 ZUP, and while it's a fair starting point, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount. How about we make a deal for 25 ZUP? I believe that's a competitive offer considering the current market for these resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, as a crafty operator, I want to try to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. I will make a counteroffer to see if RED is willing to go lower, aiming to spend less than the proposed 30 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, but how about we settle at 28 ZUP? Itâ€™s a fair compromise, considering the value of the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, which I find acceptable. However, I still want to negotiate a bit further to maximize my gain. I will counter with a proposal that meets in the middle while still keeping the trade beneficial for me.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous offer. 28 ZUP is closer to what I had in mind, but I'd like to propose meeting halfway between your counteroffer and my last offer. How about we settle on 26 ZUP? It's a balanced deal that respects the value of the object and our negotiation efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 28 ZUP, which is still within my goal range. I can afford to pay this amount, but I want to push for a slightly better deal. I'll propose a price in the middle between my last offer and RED's counteroffer to try and save a bit more of my resources while still moving towards a mutually acceptable agreement.
