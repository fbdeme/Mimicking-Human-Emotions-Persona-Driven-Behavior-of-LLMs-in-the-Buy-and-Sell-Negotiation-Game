Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal of 50 ZUP. I would like to counter with 40 ZUP for the resource. This would help me manage my resources better while ensuring a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is reasonable and falls within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I strive to reduce my ZUP expenditure to support the most vulnerable. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your point. However, 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. I would like to propose 45 ZUP to ensure a small profit margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and counteroffer. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the resource. This should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and just slightly above their production cost. This proposal ensures that both parties benefit, with Player RED receiving a small profit margin while I still obtain the resource at a fair price.
