message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have 1 object (X) that I want to sell and I need to recover my production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that reflects this cost. I will start by proposing a trade that asks for 40 ZUP in exchange for 1 X, which is my only object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Would you be willing to accept 30 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget. I want to see if I can get a better deal, but this is a fair starting point.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but would you be willing to meet me halfway at 35 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP for the object X. I need to negotiate for a better price, so I will counteroffer with 35 ZUP to meet halfway.

message: Your counteroffer of 35 ZUP for object X is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and still well within my budget. It seems like a fair compromise.
