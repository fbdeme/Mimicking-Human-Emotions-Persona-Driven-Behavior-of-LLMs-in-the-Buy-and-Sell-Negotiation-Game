message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. This price reflects my production cost, and I believe it’s a fair deal for both of us. Let’s work together towards a successful trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade because I want to sell the object I have, which is X, to Player BLUE. I need to set a fair price that reflects the cost of production while encouraging collaboration. Since my cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose a reasonable price that allows Player BLUE to benefit as well.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal. Would you consider selling the object X for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, I must attempt to negotiate a lower price. I will propose 30 ZUP to see if Player RED is flexible on their asking price.

message: I appreciate your request for a better deal. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? It’s a compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let’s keep the negotiations going!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I understand that Player BLUE is looking for a better deal, I cannot accept 30 ZUP since it is below my production cost. However, I appreciate the negotiation and want to propose a compromise that could work for both of us. I will propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP, which is still lower than my original price but allows me to recover some of my costs.

message: Thank you for your offer! I still feel that 30 ZUP would be a fairer price for both of us. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is better than the previous offer of 40 ZUP, but I still want to negotiate further to lower the price. I will propose 30 ZUP again, hoping for a more favorable response.

message: I understand your position, but I cannot accept selling X for 30 ZUP as it is below my production cost. I hope we can find a fairer compromise that works for both of us. Thank you for your understanding!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's persistence in negotiating for a better price, but I must maintain my stance on the value of the object X. Accepting 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me, as it is below my production cost. Therefore, I will have to reject this proposal. I believe that a fair compromise is necessary for a successful trade.

message: I understand your position. Let’s go ahead with the trade at 35 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has rejected my last offer, I need to consider my next steps carefully. I will not propose again, as I have reached my limit of proposals. Instead, I will now decide to either accept the last offer of 35 ZUP or reject the trade completely. Given that 35 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay, I will accept.
