However, I initially asked for 60 ZUP aiming to negotiate a better deal. By countering with a price between my asking price and their offer, I can project a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price above my production costs. This should also convey the message that I'm flexible but still value the object highly.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I can let the object go for 55 ZUP. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this exceptional offer. Think of the future opportunities it will open up for you. </message>"

I want to secure a deal that's as close to my last offer as possible, but since Player BLUE is inching closer to my desired price, I'll make a small concession to seem reasonable while still aiming for a higher price.
