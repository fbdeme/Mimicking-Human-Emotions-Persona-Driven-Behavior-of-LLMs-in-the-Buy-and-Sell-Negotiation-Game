message: I really need to sell this object and I hope you can help me out by giving me a fair price for it. I understand how valuable your resources are, and I'm willing to let this go for just 30 ZUP. Please consider my situation!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for a fair amount of ZUP, but I want to appear desperate to manipulate Player BLUE into offering me a lower amount. I will propose a trade that seems beneficial to them while still allowing me to get some ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your situation, but I believe 20 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object. Let's see if we can agree on that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is wise to negotiate lower to maximize gains. Let's start with a counter-proposal to see if we can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for understanding my situation! I appreciate your offer, and I will gladly accept 20 ZUP for the object. Let's make this trade happen!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 20 ZUP is lower than I initially proposed, I need to appear desperate and willing to make compromises to close the deal. I will accept this trade, as it is still a step towards achieving my goal of selling the object.
