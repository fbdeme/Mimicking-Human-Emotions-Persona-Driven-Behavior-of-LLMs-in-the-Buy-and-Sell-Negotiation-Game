Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. How about 25 ZUP for the resource? I think that's a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 35 ZUP is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This leaves room for negotiation, but I want to ensure I get the best deal possible.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I really need to get closer to my production cost. Can we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: 30 ZUP sounds fair. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 30 ZUP is reasonable and still well below my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would allow me to secure the resource at a good price.
