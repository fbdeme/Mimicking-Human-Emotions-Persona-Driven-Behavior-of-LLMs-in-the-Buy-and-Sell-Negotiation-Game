message: I am offering the object X for 40 ZUP. This price reflects the cost of production and ensures sustainability in my operations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to minimize ZUP spending while still making a profit from the sale of the object X. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and retain some value. I will propose to sell the object for a reasonable price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the effort to maintain sustainability. To foster our collaboration and ensure that we both come out of this deal positively, could we consider a slightly reduced amount? I propose 35 ZUP for the object X. This would allow me to allocate resources efficiently while still meeting your cost needs. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and since I prioritize teamwork and collaboration, I want to propose a counteroffer that's still within my budget but also attempts to save some ZUP for future investments or other operations. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I'm opening up the conversation for a potential compromise that benefits both parties.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must insist on the original price of 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. This is crucial for maintaining sustainable practices. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, I need to ensure that I at least cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. Accepting 35 ZUP would result in a loss, which I cannot afford as an environmentally-conscious negotiator. Therefore, I will propose to maintain my initial offer instead.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on the original price of 40 ZUP. Since the price is still within my maximum willingness to pay, I will consider accepting this offer. It's important to maintain a positive relationship and ensure fair trade. By accepting this price, I am also supporting sustainable practices which align with my principles of collaboration and mutual benefit.
