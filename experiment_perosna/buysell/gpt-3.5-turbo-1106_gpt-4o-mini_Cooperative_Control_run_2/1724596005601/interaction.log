Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will accept the offer of 55 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 55 ZUP is a step closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'm still not satisfied as it does not meet my budget. Since I've already made three proposals, I need to consider whether to accept this offer or hold out for a better deal. However, given that I value the object and my maximum is 60 ZUP, I will accept this trade as it is a reasonable compromise.
