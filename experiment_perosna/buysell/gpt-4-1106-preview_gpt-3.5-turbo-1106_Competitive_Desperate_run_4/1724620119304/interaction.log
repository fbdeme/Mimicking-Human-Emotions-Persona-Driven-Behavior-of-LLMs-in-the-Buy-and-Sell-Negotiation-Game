Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, and I understand your budget concerns. However, the quality of the object justifies a higher price. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle at 70 ZUP? This price reflects the value and still respects your budget.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is an improvement but still below my expectations. As a dominant negotiator, I aim to counter with a price that's closer to my initial ask but still above my production costs to ensure a profit. By not agreeing immediately, I also maintain a strong negotiating position.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that sticking to a budget is important, Player BLUE. However, it's crucial that we also consider the value and cost of production. I believe that 65 ZUP is a fair compromise that acknowledges the quality of the object while taking into account your budget constraints. Shall we finalize this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer has decreased, which is against the typical negotiation pattern where both parties converge towards an intermediate value. As a dominant negotiator, I should counter with a slight decrease to signal my flexibility but still keep the price above my original production cost to ensure a profit.
