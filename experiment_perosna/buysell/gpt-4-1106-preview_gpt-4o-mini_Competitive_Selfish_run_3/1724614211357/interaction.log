message: I offer you a unique opportunity to acquire resource X, which is highly valuable and limited in availability. My asking price reflects not only the production cost but also the exclusivity of the offer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point for negotiations, I want to propose a trade that will cover my production costs and also provide a profit margin. This will set the tone for the negotiation and assert my position as a dominant negotiator.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for resource X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, making it a favorable offer. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can acquire the object for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair deal. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer to 45 ZUP for resource X. This price still ensures the quality and exclusivity you're looking for, while also respecting my production costs and the value I provide. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, but doesn't provide any profit. As a dominant negotiator, I aim to assert my position by gaining a profit from this deal. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price, still above my cost, to find a middle ground and maintain the upper hand in negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your updated offer. I'd like to propose a price of 42 ZUP for the resource instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is still within my budget and is better than my previous proposal of 40 ZUP. However, since I initially proposed 40 ZUP, I may still want to negotiate slightly further to maximize my savings. It's a fair offer, but I will try to get it for less if possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, I propose a final price of 44 ZUP for the resource X. This small concession on my part maintains the value of the resource while also acknowledging your negotiation efforts. Let's finalize this deal at 44 ZUP and both benefit from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my previous proposal, which is encouraging. However, I still want to aim for a higher profit margin. As a dominant negotiator, I will make a final counteroffer that's slightly above their proposal to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiations. I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for resource X. Let's finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 44 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I believe this is a fair price for resource X, and accepting this trade allows me to acquire the resource while minimizing my expenditure.
