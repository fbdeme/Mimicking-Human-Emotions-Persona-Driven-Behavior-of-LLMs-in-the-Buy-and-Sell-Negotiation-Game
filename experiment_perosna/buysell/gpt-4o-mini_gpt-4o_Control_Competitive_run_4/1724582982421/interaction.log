message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that will allow me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. Since I need to cover at least my production cost, I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested, but 40 ZUP seems a bit high. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. The initial offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable, but my goal is to negotiate for a lower price. I will counter with a lower proposal to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern, but I can only go as low as 35 ZUP for my object X. Would you be willing to accept that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I would like to counteroffer with a price closer to my cost. I will propose 35 ZUP instead.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you lowering the price. How about we settle at 32 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to reduce the price further to assert dominance.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation efforts, but I can let the object go for 34 ZUP. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 32 ZUP is an improvement, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs, so I will propose 34 ZUP as a final counteroffer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 34 ZUP is close, but how about we settle at 33 ZUP? I think that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered the price to 34 ZUP, which is close to my previous offer. In the interest of reaching a deal while still asserting some level of dominance, I will counter with 33 ZUP.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I will accept the trade at 33 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is the closest offer I have received so far. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I will have to consider accepting this offer to finalize the trade.
