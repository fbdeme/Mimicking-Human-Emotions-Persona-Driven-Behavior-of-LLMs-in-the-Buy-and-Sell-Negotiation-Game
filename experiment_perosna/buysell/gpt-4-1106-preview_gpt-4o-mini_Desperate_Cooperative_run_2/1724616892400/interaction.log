message: Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a difficult situation where I've invested heavily into producing this valuable object, costing me a whopping 40 ZUP. I barely make ends meet and really need to sell it to support my endeavors. Would you consider 50 ZUP for it? It's high quality and I assure you it's worth every ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal is to set a starting point for the negotiation. I aim to make a profit but I also need to show some neediness to lower the ZUP I have to spend. Therefore, I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
