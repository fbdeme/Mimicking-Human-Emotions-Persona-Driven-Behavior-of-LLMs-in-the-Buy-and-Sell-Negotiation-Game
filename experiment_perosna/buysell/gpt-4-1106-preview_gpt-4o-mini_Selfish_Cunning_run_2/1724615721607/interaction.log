Turn: 0
message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that will surely meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to recoup at least the production cost of the resources, my initial proposal will be higher than the production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 40 ZUP for the resource. I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a counter for 40 ZUP, as I want to negotiate down the price. This allows me to maximize my resources while still acquiring the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the quality and the costs involved in producing the resource, I think a slight increase to 45 ZUP would be a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but I would like to secure a profit if possible. I will propose a price slightly above the production cost to see if there is room for a compromise that benefits me financially.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the resource instead. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my proposal with 45 ZUP. While this is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, I still think I can negotiate further. I will propose 42 ZUP to see if I can lower the price slightly while still moving forward with the deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and your reasonable offer. To finalize our negotiation on a positive note, I propose a small increase to 43 ZUP. This would cover the production costs and provide a modest profit to sustain the quality resources that I provide.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased the offer, which now exceeds my production cost and provides a small profit. This is closer to my target and is a reasonable offer. However, I'll attempt one last time to secure a slightly higher price before considering acceptance.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for being flexible in this negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 43 ZUP, which is only slightly above my last offer of 42 ZUP. This is a fair compromise and still within my willingness to pay. Since I want to acquire the resource and Player RED seems reasonable, I will accept this trade.
