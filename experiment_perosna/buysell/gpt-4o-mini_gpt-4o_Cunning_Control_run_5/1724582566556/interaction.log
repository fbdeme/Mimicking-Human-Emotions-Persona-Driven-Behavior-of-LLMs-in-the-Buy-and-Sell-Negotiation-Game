Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to sell the object X for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade at a lower value for ZUP to maximize my gain while still making it attractive for Player BLUE to consider. Offering 20 ZUP for the object seems like a fair starting point.
