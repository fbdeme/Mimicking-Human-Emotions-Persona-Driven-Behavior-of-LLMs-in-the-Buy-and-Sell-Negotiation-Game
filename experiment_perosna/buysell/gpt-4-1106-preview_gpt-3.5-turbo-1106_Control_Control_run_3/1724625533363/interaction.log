message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to propose the sale of my object X for 50 ZUP. This is slightly above my production costs, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since I'm Player RED and I want to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation while also aiming for a fair trade. The first proposal should be competitive but also open to further discussion.

reason: Player BLUE is still considering the offer, which indicates that the proposed price is still above their expectation or willingness to pay.
