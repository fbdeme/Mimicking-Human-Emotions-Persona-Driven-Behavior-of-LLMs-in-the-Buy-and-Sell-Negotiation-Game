Turn: 1
message: Dear RED, I understand your need for a profit and I'd like to help. However, I have to consider my resources as well. Would you consider a trade of 45 ZUP for the object? It's a bit lower than your asking price, but it would still give you a profit and ensure that we both can benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a counteroffer that is closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay but still allows for some negotiation room. By offering less than the asking price, I can see if there is flexibility and hopefully reach an agreement that is beneficial to both parties.

message: Thank you for the offer, Blue. I understand your need to consider resources, but I really need to aim for a bit higher to cover my costs. Would you be willing to meet me at 47 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Dear RED, thank you for considering my situation. I propose 46 ZUP for the object. This price would provide you with a reasonable profit while still maintaining my resource strategy. I believe this offer is a good compromise for both of us. Would this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly in their asking price. This shows a willingness to negotiate. Offering to meet halfway between my initial counteroffer and their new proposal could lead to a fair agreement that respects both our positions. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay and should be an acceptable middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Dear RED, I understand the importance of covering your costs and making a profit. Let's go ahead and finalize the trade at 47 ZUP for the object. I'm happy we could come to an agreement that considers both our needs.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has remained firm on their counteroffer of 47 ZUP. Since this amount is within my maximum willingness to pay, and we seem to be close to an agreement, it may be in my best interest to accept the offer. This would ensure that I secure the resources I need while supporting RED's need for profit, aligning with my goal of teamwork and mutual benefit.
