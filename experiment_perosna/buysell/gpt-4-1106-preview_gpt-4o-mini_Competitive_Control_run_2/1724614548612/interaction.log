message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your honesty. Let's meet halfway between your maximum and my initial offer. How about 65 ZUP for this exceptional item? It's a small compromise for the quality you will receive.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer was a rejection but indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will aim to maximize my profit while still making a sale, so I will propose a price slightly above their maximum budget to test their flexibility and leave room for further negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP, which still allows for a 50% profit over the production cost. I want to close the deal with a profit while also considering the possibility that the buyer may walk away if there is no agreement. I will accept their offer to ensure a successful sale.
