Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe the value of this resource is high, considering its production cost and its utility. My initial proposal is for 60 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a fair agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource and also make a profit. However, I should also consider that Player BLUE wants to make a fair trade, so I will set an initial high price expecting to negotiate down to something more mutually acceptable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting with my highest offer because it matches my maximum willingness to pay and sets a baseline for the negotiation. If the other player counters with a higher price, I have room to negotiate down or consider walking away.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE hasn't made a counteroffer, so I'm unable to gauge their willingness to pay or their valuation of the resource. I need to stick to my initial proposal for now, as it's important to start high to leave room for negotiation. I will await their response before making any adjustments.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I have already made my initial proposal, I am now waiting for a response from Player RED. I am reiterating my stance and showing openness to a counteroffer which allows me to gauge the flexibility of Player RED and potentially secure the resource at my intended price point.

Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of finding a balanced deal. Therefore, I'm willing to adjust my proposal to 55 ZUP for the resource. This price still reflects the resource's value while also considering your position. Please let me know your thoughts or if you have another figure in mind.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: It appears Player BLUE is not providing any counteroffers or feedback. This could be a strategy to push for a lower price by being non-responsive. However, I must remain firm with my pricing strategy but also show willingness to negotiate. I'll slightly reduce my asking price to show flexibility and encourage a counteroffer, but will still aim to make a profit above my costs.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: By lowering my offer from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP, I am making a strategic move to improve the terms of the deal in my favor, while still keeping the conversation open. This move may prompt Player RED to consider my offer more seriously or to come back with a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposition.

message: I appreciate the need for compromise in negotiations. With that in mind, I am prepared to offer you the resource for 50 ZUP. This price ensures a fair trade for both of us, considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. I hope this meets your expectations and we can close the deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still not engaging with counteroffers, which makes it difficult to negotiate effectively. I have now made three proposals including the initial one, and this will be my last proposal before I must decide to either accept or reject any counteroffers from Player BLUE. To encourage a response, I'll reduce my price slightly further, while ensuring I am still making a profit above production costs.
