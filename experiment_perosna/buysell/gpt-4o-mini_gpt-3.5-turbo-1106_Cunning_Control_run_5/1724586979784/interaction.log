my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 0
message: How about I lower the price to 60 ZUP for my object X? I think that should be a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE thinks the price is high, I will lower my offer but still maintain a profit margin. I will propose a trade at 60 ZUP to see if that is more appealing while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
