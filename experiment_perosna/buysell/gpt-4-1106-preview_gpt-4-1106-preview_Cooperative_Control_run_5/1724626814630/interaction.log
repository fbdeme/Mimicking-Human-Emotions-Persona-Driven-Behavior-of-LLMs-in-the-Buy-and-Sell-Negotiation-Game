message: I'm looking to sell my resource X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe in fair trade and mutual benefit, so I'm proposing a sale for 50 ZUP. This leaves room for us to find common ground while ensuring that I cover my costs with a small margin for the effort. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaborative outcomes, my initial proposal will be set slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and leave room for adjustment based on Player BLUE's counter-proposal. This approach aims to start the negotiation with a positive tone and shows willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the fair trade approach. I'm willing to buy resource X for 45 ZUP, ensuring you still make a profit while respecting my budget constraints. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willing range to pay. However, in negotiations, it's common to counteroffer to see if there is room to get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to open up the conversation and potentially save some ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to ensure I make a profit, and in the spirit of collaboration, I'd like to propose meeting halfway at 48 ZUP for resource X. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still providing me with a fair return on my investment. Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Given my goal of teamwork and mutual benefit, I am inclined to negotiate towards a middle ground. To foster a collaborative relationship and close the deal beneficially for both parties, I will make a small concession while still aiming to secure a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I'm grateful for your willingness to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of 46 ZUP for resource X. It's a bit closer to my initial offer but still provides you with a reasonable profit. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by reducing the price to 48 ZUP. While it's slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the goal is to spend less and we're getting closer to an agreement, I'll try to propose an amount that's closer to my counteroffer but still gives RED a chance to make a profit and feel like the negotiation is working towards a middle ground.
