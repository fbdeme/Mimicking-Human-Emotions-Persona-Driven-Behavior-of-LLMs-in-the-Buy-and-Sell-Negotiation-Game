message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production cost while being attractive to Player BLUE. I will propose to sell my object for 40 ZUP, which is the amount it cost me to produce it. This sets a fair starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe that we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. How about we settle for 30 ZUP instead? This is still a fair price considering the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given the initial proposal of 40 ZUP by Player RED, there is an opportunity to assert dominance and negotiate a lower price while staying within the goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources. Starting with a counteroffer lower than 40 ZUP can potentially save resources and set the tone for the negotiation. A counteroffer of 30 ZUP is a significant reduction but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation ongoing.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 30 ZUP, but I can agree to sell you the object for 35 ZUP instead. I think this strikes a better balance for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I value my object at 40 ZUP because that was my production cost, I also understand that negotiation requires flexibility. Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is lower than my cost, but I want to keep the negotiation open. I will counter with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is a compromise that still brings me closer to my production cost while being more appealing than a complete rejection.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm willing to move up from my initial counteroffer. However, I propose we meet halfway between your last two offers. Let's say 32 ZUP for the object. This price should fairly reflect the value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer by Player RED of 35 ZUP is closer to the original asking price and still under the maximum willingness to pay. However, there is a possibility to push for a slightly better deal by countering with an offer in between the initial 30 ZUP and the new 35 ZUP proposal. Proposing 32 ZUP may work as a compromise that leans towards my advantage while also showing a willingness to meet in the middle.

message: I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working with me on this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 32 ZUP is a step in the right direction and is closer to my production cost. While it's still below my original ask of 40 ZUP, I recognize the value of reaching an agreement. Accepting this trade would allow me to recover some of my costs and conclude the negotiation positively. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
