message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair and beneficial trade for both of us. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose to trade it for 50 ZUP, ensuring that I can cover my costs and invest in producing more. I'm open to your thoughts and counter-proposals. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As my first proposal, I want to set a starting point for the negotiation that reflects the production cost of the resource but also leaves room for negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll propose a price slightly higher to allow for some bargaining and to cover my costs while also aiming for a small profit.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your goal to keep costs reasonable and I'm here to work with you towards a fair deal. I've considered your offer and would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade of X for 48 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and ensures you're still spending less than your maximum threshold. I hope this meets your needs while respecting the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly higher than my production cost but lower than my initial asking price. As a negotiator focused on teamwork and collaboration, it's important to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. I will propose a compromise that's closer to my initial ask but still within the range that Player BLUE might find acceptable, considering their maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP.
