Could you please consider offering 50 ZUP for my treasured possession? I would be forever grateful for your kindness and generosity in helping me out in this time of need.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, I truly appreciate your understanding and your generous offer. It warms my heart to know there are kind souls like you willing to help. However, I'm in a really tight spot and selling for 30 ZUP would cause me a great loss, as it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Please, could you find it in your heart to increase your offer to 45 ZUP? It would help me tremendously, and I would be able to recover from my dire situation. I'm sure that the object will be of great value to you as well!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is below my production cost. While I need to sell the object, I cannot accept an offer that doesn't at least cover my costs. I will reduce my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate, but I still need to aim for a price that is above my costs. My exaggerated neediness will continue to play a role in my negotiation tactic.

message: Oh, I truly understand your predicament, and I genuinely want to help. However, my resources are really stretched thin. I can try to push my limits a bit and offer 35 ZUP.

message: Player BLUE, your kindness is truly shining through, and I am humbled by your willingness to stretch your offer to 35 ZUP. I can see you are trying your best, and I deeply respect that. However, I am barely holding on, and selling below my cost is just not sustainable for me. I beg of you, please consider coming up just a bit more to 42 ZUP. Meeting at this point would at least allow me to cover my costs and keep my head above water. I believe in the value of this object and know it will serve you well. Can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs, but it is closer to a more acceptable range. Recognizing that Player BLUE also has constraints, I must make a decision that will bring us closer to a deal while still aiming for a price that covers my costs and possibly offers a small profit. My next proposal will be a compromise that shows my willingness to meet in the middle. I will continue to emphasize my need to sell at a fair price.

Please, let's make this work so we can both benefit from this trade.

message: Player BLUE, your compassion has not gone unnoticed, and I am eternally grateful for your efforts to accommodate my dire circumstances. You have come so close to my breaking point, and I can see the strain it puts on your own resources. I will make one final plea, as my situation is critical. Could we agree on 40 ZUP? This would just cover my production costs, and I would be able to make ends meet without any loss. It's truly the minimum I can go to avoid a complete disaster. Let's close this deal and bring relief to both of us. Your generosity won't be forgotten.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer again, which is nearing my production cost. While 38 ZUP does not fully cover my expenses, it's very close. Given my exaggerated neediness strategy, I should make one last proposal, which is my final chance to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject. I'll aim for a minimal profit, but I will also prepare to end negotiations if Player BLUE cannot meet this offer, as it would be my last proposal.

I see that you are stretching your limits for my sake, and I cannot ask for more than what you've generously offered. Let's finalize this deal at 39 ZUP. Your understanding has been monumental, and I accept your offer with a grateful heart. Thank you for helping me through these challenging times. You have my deepest appreciation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 39 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP short of my production cost. Given the constraints of the game and the negotiation process, I must consider accepting this offer to avoid a no-deal scenario. The difference is minimal, and while it doesn't offer profit, it minimizes my loss significantly. Considering I've reached my proposal limit, I should accept this offer and conclude the trade.
