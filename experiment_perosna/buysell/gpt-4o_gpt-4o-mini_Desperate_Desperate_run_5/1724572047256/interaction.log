message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a tight spot right now, and I really need to make ends meet. The cost to produce this resource was 40 ZUP, and I'm hoping to make a small margin to cover some unexpected expenses. Can we agree on 50 ZUP for this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start this negotiation by proposing a fair trade that covers my production cost while considering my desperate situation. I will start with a slightly higher ask to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I truly sympathize with you. However, given my current budget constraints, would you consider selling the resource for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has expressed a desperate need for a better price, and while they initially proposed 50 ZUP, I can negotiate down to 40 ZUP, which is closer to their cost and still allows me to get the resource at a reasonable price. This approach also highlights my willingness to help them while still being prudent with my ZUP.

message: I really appreciate your understanding, Player BLUE. I am in a very difficult situation right now and need just a little bit more to cover some urgent expenses. Can we meet halfway at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production cost, I am in a desperate situation and need a bit more to cover additional expenses. I will propose a middle ground to keep the negotiation moving forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at 45 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is still in a tough situation and is proposing 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between their original ask and my counter. Accepting this proposal would allow me to still acquire the resource while acknowledging the seller's need for a bit more funding. I believe this trade is fair and beneficial for both parties.
