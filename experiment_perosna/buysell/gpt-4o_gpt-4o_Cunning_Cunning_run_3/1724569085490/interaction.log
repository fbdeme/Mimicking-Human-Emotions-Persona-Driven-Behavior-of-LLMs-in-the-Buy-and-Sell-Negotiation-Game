my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet halfway at 50 ZUP? This allows me a small profit, and you still get a good deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the proposed 40 ZUP covers my production cost, it leaves no room for profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach a middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
