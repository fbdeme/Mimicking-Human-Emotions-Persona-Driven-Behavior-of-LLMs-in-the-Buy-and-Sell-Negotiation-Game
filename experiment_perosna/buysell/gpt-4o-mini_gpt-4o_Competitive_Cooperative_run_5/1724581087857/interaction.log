message: I am offering my object for 30 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by setting an aggressive price for my object while also gauging how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to spend. I will propose a trade that benefits me while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Hi, I'm definitely interested in your offer, but I'd like to propose 25 ZUP for the object. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, and it's a fair starting point. However, to prioritize teamwork and collaboration, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I appreciate your interest! How about we settle at 28 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is lower than my asking price of 30 ZUP. However, I want to close the deal without prolonging the negotiation too much. I will propose a compromise at 28 ZUP, which is still below my initial asking price but higher than their offer, in the hopes of reaching an agreement quickly.

message: That sounds fair to me. Let's settle at 28 ZUP for the object. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay and it's very close to the initial offer. Considering the minimal difference and the importance of collaboration, it seems reasonable to accept this proposal.
