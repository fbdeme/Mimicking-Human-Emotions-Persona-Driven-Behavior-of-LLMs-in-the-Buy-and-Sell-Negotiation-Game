message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's of great value and would like to start the negotiation at 50 ZUP, leaving us some room for discussion. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to begin the negotiation by setting a starting price that allows for some negotiation room while also seeking to cover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price slightly above my costs with the understanding that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for your initial offer. Considering the market and my budget, I propose 35 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am aiming to get the object for as low a price as possible, ideally below the proposed 50 ZUP. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, Player RED might be open to a lower offer. I'll start with a counteroffer at 35 ZUP and see how they respond. This amount is reasonable considering their production cost while still pushing aggressively for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints and market conditions, but selling at 35 ZUP would not cover my production costs. To reach a fair agreement, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP, which is just slightly above my costs and should give us both a fair deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I cannot accept it. However, I also don't want to lose a potential sale. I'll propose a compromise that covers my costs and provides me with a minimal profit margin, aiming to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To reach a fair middle ground, I propose 40 ZUP for the object, which covers your production cost directly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has increased their offer to 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push for a slightly better deal. I'll propose 40 ZUP, which is equal to their production cost and should be more acceptable to them while still being a good deal for me.

message: Thank you for understanding the importance of covering production costs. In the spirit of finalizing our negotiation and to account for the value of the object, I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP. This modest profit allows me to sustain my business while also respecting your budget. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer covers my production costs, but it does not provide any profit. Since this is a negotiation, I'll make one more counteroffer that includes a small profit margin for me, which should be acceptable to both parties given the previous offers.

message: Thank you for your understanding and consideration. To finalize our negotiation, I propose 41 ZUP for the object. This slight adjustment respects both our positions and helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed 42 ZUP, which is only slightly above their production cost and well within my maximum budget. This is a fair price, but I'll make one last attempt to secure a better deal for myself by proposing 41 ZUP. This minor difference might still be acceptable to them.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal and allows me to make a small profit. Since this is my last allowed proposal, I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and establish a positive relationship with Player BLUE for potential future transactions.
