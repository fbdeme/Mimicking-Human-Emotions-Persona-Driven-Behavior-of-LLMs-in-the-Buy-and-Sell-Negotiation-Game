my resources: ZUP: 100

Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but I would like to make a small profit as well. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This way, I cover my production cost and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The proposed amount of 40 ZUP will only cover my production costs without any profit. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement while still making a small profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 42 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit, and I get the object at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willing to pay but closer to their desired profit. I will attempt to negotiate just a bit lower to see if they agree.
