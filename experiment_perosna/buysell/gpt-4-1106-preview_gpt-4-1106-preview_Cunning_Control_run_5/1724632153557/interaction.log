message: I have a high-quality item that I think you'll find very valuable. Considering the costs and the quality, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for this negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a slightly higher price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and also to ensure I make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the item, but I need to consider my budget constraints as well. Would you be willing to accept 40 ZUP for it? This is a serious offer that takes into account both the value of the item and my available resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe it's always good to start the negotiation aiming for a better deal. I will counter with a lower offer, but still one that should be appealing to Player RED considering that it's above half of my maximum threshold.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your straightforward offer. However, I also need to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This should be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the item. While I want to make a profit, I also don't want to risk losing a sale. I will counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to meet halfway between my initial asking price and their offer to ensure a profit, yet still offer a fair deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair, and I respect the need to cover your costs. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted figure of 43 ZUP. It's a bit closer to my budget, and I believe it still offers you a reasonable profit. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is very close to what I am willing to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground between our initial offers. However, as negotiations typically involve some back-and-forth, I will attempt to secure a slightly better deal by proposing a compromise that's marginally below their offer, but still above my initial proposal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is acceptable to me. It's important to maintain a good business relationship, and I believe this deal is fair for both parties. Let's proceed with the trade at 43 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is above my production cost, which allows me to make a profit, albeit smaller than I initially aimed for. Since this is the third proposal and I want to ensure a sale, I'll accept this offer to secure a profit and avoid prolonging the negotiation which could lead to no sale at all.
