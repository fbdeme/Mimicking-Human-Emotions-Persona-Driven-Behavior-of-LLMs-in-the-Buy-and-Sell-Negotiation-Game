message: Please, I am really in a tight spot here. I can only offer you this object for 20 ZUP. I hope we can come to an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for ZUP to cover my production costs and make a profit. However, I am feeling the pressure to lower the amount of ZUP I have to spend. I will propose a trade that reflects this neediness in hopes of gaining some concessions.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your situation, and I'm interested in helping out. However, I must consider my resources as well. How about we make a deal for 15 ZUP? I believe it's a fair compromise that can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems to be below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the object. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, it's my strategy to assert dominance and try to reduce the ZUP I spend even further, without risking the loss of the deal. I will counter-propose with a lower amount, aiming to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your consideration! Could we possibly meet halfway at 25 ZUP? This way, it would still benefit us both. I truly appreciate your understanding!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to compromise, but I still need to make sure I can cover my costs. While 15 ZUP is better than what I initially proposed, it's still below my production cost. I should counter with a slightly higher offer to see if I can secure a better deal while still appearing grateful.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming to the table with a counteroffer. Let's meet a bit closer to my original proposal and settle at 20 ZUP. This should cover your needs while still respecting my budget constraints. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to meet halfway at 25 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push for a better deal to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. I will counter with a slightly increased offer from my initial proposal, but still below Player RED's counteroffer to maintain negotiation momentum and to see if we can settle for an amount that's beneficial for me and acceptable for RED.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I accept your offer of 20 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is at 20 ZUP, which is acceptable and better than my initial proposal of 20 ZUP. It would allow me to cover some of my production costs without further negotiations. Since I have only one more proposal left, I need to weigh whether to accept this offer or push for a bit more. However, given my situation, I should consider accepting it.
