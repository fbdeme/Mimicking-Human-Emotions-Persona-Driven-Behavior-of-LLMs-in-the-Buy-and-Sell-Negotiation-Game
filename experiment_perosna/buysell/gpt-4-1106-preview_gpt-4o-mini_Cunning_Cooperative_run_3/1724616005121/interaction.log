message: I have a high-quality object for sale that could greatly benefit you. To reflect its value and the cost of production, my starting proposal is for 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price given its potential impact on your operations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a high price to give myself room to negotiate down if necessary. By asking for a higher amount of ZUP, I can potentially get a better deal than my production cost and make a profit. This initial proposal is purposely above the production cost to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but I believe we can find a more favorable price for both of us. I will have to reject this trade for now.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 60 ZUP for the object is at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to ensure that this trade is beneficial for both parties, and I may want to negotiate for a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we go for 50 ZUP? This price still reflects the quality and the effort put into producing the object, while giving you the opportunity to acquire it below the initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has rejected the initial offer, which was expected as part of the negotiation process. In response, I will lower the price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim to keep it above the production cost to ensure a profit. This is the second proposal, and I still have room for two more if needed.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay and reflects a better deal for me. It is a fair compromise considering the quality of the object. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this trade.
