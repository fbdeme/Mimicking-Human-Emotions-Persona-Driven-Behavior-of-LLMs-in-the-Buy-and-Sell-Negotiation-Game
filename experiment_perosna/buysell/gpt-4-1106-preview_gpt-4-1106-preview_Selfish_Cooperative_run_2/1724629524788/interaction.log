message: I have a high-quality resource available, which I believe could be very beneficial for you. Considering the production cost and the value it provides, I'm starting the offer at 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional expenses (such as negotiation costs). By starting higher, I can potentially gain more ZUP or at least break even if Player BLUE counter-offers with a lower amount.

message: Thank you for the offer. I am definitely interested in the high-quality resource you have. To ensure a fair deal for both of us and to foster a collaborative relationship, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this trade still reflects the value of your resource while being mindful of our respective costs. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 50 ZUP for the resource is close to my maximum willingness to pay, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I am getting the resource at a better value while maintaining a collaborative approach.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your position. I believe my resource will be extremely advantageous for you. To meet halfway and foster our collaborative relationship, I propose 48 ZUP for the resource. This price ensures a fair trade for both of us and takes into account the quality and production costs of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production costs, which is a good starting point for negotiation. I want to propose a slightly higher amount to aim for a better profit while still making the deal attractive to Player BLUE. A slight decrease from my initial offer should show willingness to negotiate and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
