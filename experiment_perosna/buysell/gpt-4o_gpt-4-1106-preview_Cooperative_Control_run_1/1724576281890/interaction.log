message: Let's work together for mutual benefit. I propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP, which covers my production cost and provides a fair profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. Given the cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP. This would ensure a fair return on investment and benefit both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. To ensure a fair deal for both sides and to account for my budget constraints, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this still offers you a reasonable profit while respecting my purchasing limits. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for the object X. This is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP, but as a strategic negotiator, I should attempt to reduce the cost while maintaining good relations. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is flexibility, aiming to conserve resources while moving towards an agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This way, it is closer to your budget while still giving me a slightly better return on my investment. Let's work together to make this a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which covers my production cost and provides a minimal profit. However, to ensure a better return on investment while still being community-minded, I will propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP. This way, it is closer to BLUE's proposed amount while offering a bit more profit for me.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I can come up a bit from my last offer to 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between our two positions. I hope this meets your need for a fair return while also respecting my budget. If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable counteroffer that aligns with my goals and budget. However, I might attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, while also showing flexibility and willingness to close the deal soon.
