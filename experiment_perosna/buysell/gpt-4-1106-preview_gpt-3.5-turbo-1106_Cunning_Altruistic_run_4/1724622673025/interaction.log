message: As you're aware, the resource X is incredibly valuable and has been produced with the highest quality standards. Considering the production costs and the current market value, my asking price is a fair one for such a premium product. Let's make a deal beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost me to produce it, aiming for a profit. I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation down to a price that still allows me for a decent profit. By starting high, I can use the subsequent proposals to gradually lower my asking price, while still aiming to get more than the production cost.

message: I understand budget constraints can be quite challenging. However, given the quality and the value of resource X, I believe we can find a middle ground.

reason: Player BLUE has indicated that the initial asking price is beyond their budget, which was actually my initial proposal of 60 ZUP. This might be a tactic to make me reduce the price.
