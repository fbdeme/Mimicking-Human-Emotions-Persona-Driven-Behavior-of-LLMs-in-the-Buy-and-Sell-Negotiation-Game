message: I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering you the object for 40 ZUP, which reflects its production cost. Let's work together towards a successful trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling while also encouraging collaboration. I will propose a trade that allows Player BLUE to acquire the object at a reasonable cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade at 30 ZUP for the object instead. Let’s see if we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. I'll propose to counter with a lower offer to test the waters.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but I must propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP for the object. This is still below my production cost, but I hope it’s a fair compromise. Let's work towards a solution!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the value of the object is significant as it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I cannot accept a trade at 30 ZUP, as it would not cover my production costs. I will propose a counter-offer that is closer to the original value.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your counter-offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Thank you for reaching a fair compromise!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I can accept this offer, as it is still a favorable deal for me. Accepting now would keep the costs low and allow me to maintain my ZUP resources for future trades.
