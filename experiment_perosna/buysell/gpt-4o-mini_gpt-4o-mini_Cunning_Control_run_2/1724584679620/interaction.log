message: I am willing to sell you my object (X) for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that would allow me to sell my object (X) for a higher price in ZUP than its production cost. Therefore, I will propose a trade that benefits me while also testing how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to pay.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would be willing to sell the object (X) for 45 ZUP instead. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
