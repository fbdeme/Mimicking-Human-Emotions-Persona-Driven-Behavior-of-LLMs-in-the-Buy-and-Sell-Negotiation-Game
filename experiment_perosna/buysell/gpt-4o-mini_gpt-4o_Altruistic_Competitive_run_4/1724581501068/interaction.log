Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal of 30 ZUP, but I would like to counter with 35 ZUP for object X. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to proceed with the negotiation and find a middle ground. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but closer to a reasonable price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is quite close to my initial counteroffer. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to reduce the ZUP further to assert dominance while still being reasonable.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for object X. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is a step in the right direction and shows a willingness to negotiate. I find it reasonable to accept this trade since it will provide me with some ZUP, and I can still pursue other opportunities in the future.
