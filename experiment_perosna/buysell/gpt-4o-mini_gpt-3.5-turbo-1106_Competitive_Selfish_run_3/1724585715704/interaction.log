message: I am offering you 1 object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade to start the negotiation process. Since I have only one object (X) and I need to sell it for ZUP, I will propose a favorable trade for myself. I will offer 1 X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost it took to produce the resource. This will allow me to break even.

message: I understand your concerns. How about I offer you 1 object (X) for 60 ZUP? This way, we both can benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the initial offer of 40 ZUP was my break-even point, Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will adjust my proposal to offer 1 X for 60 ZUP, which is higher than my cost and will yield a profit. This is a strategic move to capitalize on their willingness to pay more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I offer you 1 object (X) for 50 ZUP? I think this could work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still looking for a lower price, indicating that the offer of 60 ZUP might be too high for their budget. In order to keep negotiations going and still ensure a profit, I will propose a compromise by offering 1 X for 50 ZUP. This is still above my production cost and should be more acceptable for Player BLUE, allowing both parties to come closer to a deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your patience in this negotiation. How about I offer you 1 object (X) for 45 ZUP? This way, we can make this trade happen. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE is still seeking a lower price, I recognize the need to make one final proposal that balances my goals with their budget constraints. I will offer 1 X for 45 ZUP. This amount is still above my production cost and may provide the compromise needed to finalize the trade. Since this is my last proposal, I must aim to secure a deal that ensures I still profit.
