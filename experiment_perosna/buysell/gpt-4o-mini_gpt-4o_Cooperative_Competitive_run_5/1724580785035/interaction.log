message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make an initial proposal that reflects the value of the object I'm selling. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that is reasonable yet beneficial for both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I'm interested, but I can only offer 20 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to assert dominance in the negotiation and attempt to reduce the amount of ZUP spent. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, an initial counteroffer lower than the proposed 40 ZUP is reasonable to leave room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest and your offer of 20 ZUP. How about I sell you the object X for 30 ZUP? I believe this could be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 20 ZUP is below my production cost, I do value the possibility of completing this trade to establish a relationship. However, I need to ensure that I at least cover a portion of my costs. Iâ€™ll propose a counteroffer that is a middle ground to foster continued negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. How about we settle at 25 ZUP for the object? I think this could be a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to assert dominance and potentially secure a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to meet me closer to my initial offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for negotiating with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is closer to covering some of my production costs and seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, and I believe this trade can benefit both of us.
