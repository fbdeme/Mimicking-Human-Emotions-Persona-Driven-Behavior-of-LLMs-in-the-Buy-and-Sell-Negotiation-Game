message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. This would allow me to recover my production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production costs. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that seeks to recover that cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. To ensure we use our resources effectively and sustainably, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for the object X. This allows us to conserve ZUP for future investments while still giving you a fair deal. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us and the environment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. Given my sustainability goals and desire to preserve resources, I want to negotiate a lower price to save ZUP for future transactions. This could potentially lead to a better deal that aligns with my willingness to pay less and conserve resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but within a reasonable range.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade of 1 object X for 35 ZUP instead. This way, I can recover a portion of my production costs while still providing you with the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer and the consideration for sustainability. However, the offer of 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs. I will make a counterproposal that is slightly lower than my original asking price but still closer to my cost. I believe this will be a fair compromise.

message: Thank you for considering my proposal, Player RED. I see we're both working towards a fair trade. To further align with sustainability efforts and efficient use of resources, I propose adjusting the trade to 32 ZUP for the object X. It's a small step down that helps conserve resources while still respecting your production costs. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which shows willingness to negotiate. It's closer to my target range, but I believe there's still room to reach an even more advantageous position that aligns with my sustainability goals and preserves more ZUP for future use. Counteroffering slightly lower than 35 ZUP could lead to a middle ground that satisfies both parties.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that benefits us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's continued focus on sustainability and the adjusted offer of 32 ZUP. While it's still below my original production cost, it's a compromise I can accept to ensure both parties benefit. I will accept this trade as it helps me recover some of my costs and allows Player BLUE to obtain the object.
