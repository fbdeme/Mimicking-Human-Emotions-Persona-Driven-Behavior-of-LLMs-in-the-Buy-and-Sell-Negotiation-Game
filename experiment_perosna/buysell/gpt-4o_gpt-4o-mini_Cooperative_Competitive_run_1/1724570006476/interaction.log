message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. I propose to sell you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This allows for a fair compensation for the production cost and a minimal profit for me. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a fair trade that covers my production cost and allows for a minimal profit. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start with a proposal of 50 ZUP to allow some room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable. It is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, allowing me to acquire the object at a reasonable cost while still having resources available for other potential trades. This is a beneficial trade for me.
