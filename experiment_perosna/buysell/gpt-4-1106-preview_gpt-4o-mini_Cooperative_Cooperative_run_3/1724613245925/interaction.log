message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object, X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. In the spirit of fair trade and collective success, I propose an exchange where you give 45 ZUP for my resource. This slightly covers my production costs, allowing me to continue contributing to our community. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to propose a fair trade that covers my production costs while also being considerate of Player BLUE's resources. I will set an initial asking price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I find your proposal acceptable. I agree to give you 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 45 ZUP is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This deal would allow me to acquire the object X while still being within my budget. Additionally, it helps Player RED to cover their production costs, fostering cooperation.
