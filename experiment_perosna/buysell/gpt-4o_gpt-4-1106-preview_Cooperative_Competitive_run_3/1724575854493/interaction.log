message: I am willing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This will help me cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. How does this sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I aim to recover my production costs of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. Hence, my initial offer should be higher than 40 ZUP to ensure profitability.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more favorable middle ground. How about we start with a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the resource? Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED matches the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay for the resource, as a fierce negotiator, my aim is to acquire the resource for less than the maximum budget to ensure a better deal. I will propose a lower price to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost and still ensures a profit. However, I will make a slight counter-proposal to aim for a slightly higher profit while still being reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a great suggestion, and I value the spirit of compromise. To further this negotiation, would you consider 52 ZUP for the resource? It's a bit closer to my initial offer, and I believe it still presents a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a middle ground at 55 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since my goal is to reduce the expenditure as much as possible, I will attempt to negotiate further for a potentially better deal, but still keep the offer within a reasonable range to maintain the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 52 ZUP is very close to my last offer and still ensures a profit over my production cost. This is a fair and reasonable compromise.
