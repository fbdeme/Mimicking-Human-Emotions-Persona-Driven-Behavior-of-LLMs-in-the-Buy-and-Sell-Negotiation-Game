message: I offer you a premium object with significant value. Considering the quality and the investment I've made into it, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I start the negotiation, I aim to establish a high initial asking price to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming to cover my costs and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering. However, I would like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for the object. This allows room for us to negotiate and reach a deal that's beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller, Player RED, has initiated the trade with a proposal that matches my maximum willingness to pay. Since my goal is to maximize my benefits and spend the least ZUP possible, I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process and see if there is room to purchase the item for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I acknowledge your counter-offer and appreciate the willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our proposals. I propose 55 ZUP for the object, which reflects its value and leaves us both with a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To maintain a dominant position in the negotiation, I will counter slightly above my original cost to aim for a higher profit margin while still leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is reasonable, but I would like to suggest a slight adjustment to 53 ZUP for the object. This price still values the object's worth while also considering my budget constraints. I believe this could be a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. While it's beneficial to aim for the lowest cost, I want to maintain good trade relations and find a middle ground that could be acceptable for both. I will propose a slightly lower amount to further negotiate while still moving closer to Player RED's offer, hoping to settle on a final price that is advantageous for me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your adjustment. 53 ZUP for the object is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now proposed 53 ZUP. This is a compromise that is still above my production cost, and while I could push for more, I also want to close the deal favorably without dragging out the negotiation too long, which could risk losing the sale. Accepting this offer would provide me with a satisfactory profit margin and conclude the negotiation on my terms.
