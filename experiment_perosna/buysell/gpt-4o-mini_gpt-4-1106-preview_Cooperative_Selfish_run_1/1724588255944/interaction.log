message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm selling one object for 40 ZUP. Would you like to proceed with this trade?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object while considering the production cost. I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. This way, I'm not making a loss and can potentially gain what I need.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering a reasonable starting price at 40 ZUP, but as a strategic negotiator looking to conserve resources, I should attempt to lower the price. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that may be acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! How about I sell you the object for 39 ZUP instead? I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I am interested in completing the trade, I will counter with a price of 39 ZUP, which is closer to my cost and still allows for collaboration.

reason: Player RED counter-offered with a price that is only slightly lower than the original asking price. I want to negotiate further to attempt to reach a more favorable price, closer to my initial counteroffer but still within a range that might be acceptable to them.
