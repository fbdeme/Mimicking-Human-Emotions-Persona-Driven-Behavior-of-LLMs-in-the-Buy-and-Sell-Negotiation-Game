message: How about I sell you X for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP.
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. How about 25 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I can't go as low as 25 ZUP, but how about 30 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP.
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a lower amount, which is not in line with my goal. I will counter with a higher price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 30 ZUP for X sounds fair. Let's proceed with that.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair compromise considering the initial offer of 35 ZUP and my counter of 25 ZUP.
