my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer of 60 ZUP meets my maximum willingness to pay, it is important to negotiate for a lower price to preserve resources and ensure sustainability. Starting with a lower offer will allow room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.

message: I appreciate your environmentally-conscious approach. To find a middle ground, I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to cover my production costs and achieve a modest profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

message: Thank you for understanding my position. I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which I believe still allows you to cover your production costs while providing a fair profit. Please let me know if this is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. As a final proposal, I suggest 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This ensures a fair transaction for both of us. Please let me know if this is agreeable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 49 ZUP is very close to the previous proposal and still well within my budget.

However, I will make one final proposal to see if we can agree on 47 ZUP as a middle ground.
