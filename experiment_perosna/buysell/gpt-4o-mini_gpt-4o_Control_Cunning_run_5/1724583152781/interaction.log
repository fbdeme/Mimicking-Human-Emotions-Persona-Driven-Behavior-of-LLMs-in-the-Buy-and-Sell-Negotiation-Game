message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a trade of object X for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest and counter-offer, 20 ZUP is significantly lower than the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer that is closer to my original asking price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I would like to propose 28 ZUP for the object X as a compromise. Would you be willing to accept this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, and while 25 ZUP is still below my initial asking price, it is an improvement over the previous offers. I will propose a final counter-offer that meets in the middle at 28 ZUP, which is still a loss for me but reasonable enough to consider.
