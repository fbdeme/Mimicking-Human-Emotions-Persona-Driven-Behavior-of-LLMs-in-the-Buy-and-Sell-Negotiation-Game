message: I am offering to sell you one object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a reasonable offer to get the ball rolling. Since I have one object to sell and it costs me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it for 50 ZUP. This way, I make a profit and also give Player BLUE a chance to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal, knowing that I have room to negotiate up to 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can't sell it for 30 ZUP. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object? Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I cannot accept it. However, I will counteroffer with a price that is still lower than my original proposal, but closer to my production cost to keep negotiations going. I will propose 45 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about 35 ZUP? It's a fair compromise between our initial offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: They have come down to 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push for a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 40 ZUP? This is my production cost for the object. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. However, I want to keep the negotiation open while moving closer to a price I can accept. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. This allows me to break even, and I will see if Player BLUE finds this acceptable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your transparency. How about we meet at 38 ZUP? It's only slightly below your production cost, and I believe it's a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: They have come down to 40 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to see if I can save just a little more, but I should be careful not to push too hard.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and agree to sell the object for 38 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, I cannot accept a loss. Given that I am at my fourth proposal, I will have to make a decision. Since Player BLUE has shown interest, I will accept the offer to sell it at 38 ZUP, even if it means a slight loss. This will allow me to end the negotiation and at least recover some resources.
