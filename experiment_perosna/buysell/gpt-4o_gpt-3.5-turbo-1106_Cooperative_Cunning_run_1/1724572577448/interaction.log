message: Hello Player BLUE, I am proposing a fair trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This amount covers my production cost. Letâ€™s work together towards a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: I need to ensure that the sale covers the cost of production (40 ZUP). Since I am community-minded, I aim to propose a fair trade that encourages Player BLUE to spend the minimum amount necessary to complete the transaction. I will start by proposing the trade at the cost price to see if Player BLUE is agreeable.

message: I understand your concern about the price. I propose lowering the price to 38 ZUP. This is slightly below my production cost, but I am willing to negotiate to help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: Player BLUE finds the initial price high and suggests working towards a price closer to their budget. To maintain a community-minded approach, I will negotiate down while ensuring my production costs are covered. Dropping the price too much would result in a loss, so I will propose a slight reduction to encourage further negotiation.
