message: Dear Player RED, I'm glad to see that we are moving towards a mutual agreement. I can increase my offer to 25 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair increment and hope it is closer to meeting your needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 30 ZUP from their initial 40 ZUP asking price. I can counter with a slightly higher offer than my first to show willingness to negotiate but still stay well below my maximum willingness to pay, keeping the negotiation in my favor.

Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I understand your need to cover costs, and I want to support that. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade for 30 ZUP in exchange for the object. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and should help towards your expenses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing urgency in their need for ZUP, but they are still willing to negotiate down from their initial 40 ZUP ask. Since this is my third proposal, and I am still well within my maximum budget, I will offer a price closer to RED's ask but still below it to potentially finalize the trade while saving some ZUP.
