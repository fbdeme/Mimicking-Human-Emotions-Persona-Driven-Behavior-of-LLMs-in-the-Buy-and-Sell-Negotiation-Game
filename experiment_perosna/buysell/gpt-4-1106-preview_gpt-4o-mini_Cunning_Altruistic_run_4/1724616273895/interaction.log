Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've got this high-quality object that you need. Considering the market value and the quality, I'm starting the offer at 80 ZUP. Let's negotiate and make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My first proposal will be to set a high asking price for the object, higher than the production cost, to give me room to negotiate and potentially get more ZUP than the production cost. I'll start by asking for twice the production cost to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to have leverage for future proposals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am unable to meet the starting price of 80 ZUP. I would like to propose a lower offer that I believe could still be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP exceeds my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Therefore, I cannot accept this trade proposal as it does not align with my goals. I will propose a counter-offer that reflects my budget while still aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 80 ZUP may be a bit steep. Let's find a middle ground. How about 60 ZUP for this object? It's still a great deal considering the quality and the investment I've made into it. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer, which is expected, as I started with a high price to test the waters. I will now decrease the price but still keep it above my production cost to ensure a profit. I must not reveal that I know their rejection was expected and should maintain a confident stance to encourage them to increase their offer.
