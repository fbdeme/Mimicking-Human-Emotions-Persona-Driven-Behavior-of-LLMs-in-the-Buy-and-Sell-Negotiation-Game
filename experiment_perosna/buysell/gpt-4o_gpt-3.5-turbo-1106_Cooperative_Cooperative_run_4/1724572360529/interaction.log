message: I believe in the success of our collective efforts. To cover the production costs and make a minimal profit, I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's work together towards a fair deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs and ideally more to make a profit.
reason: My first proposal will be to cover the production cost and ensure a minimal profit. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a profit.
