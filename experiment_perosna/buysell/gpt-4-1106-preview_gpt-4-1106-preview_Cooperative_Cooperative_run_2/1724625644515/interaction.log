message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you an exclusive resource X, which I have invested 40 ZUP to produce. I believe this resource will be valuable to you, and so I propose a fair trade that reflects both its value and the effort put into producing it. Let's start the negotiation at 45 ZUP, and I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this does not meet your valuation. I am confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I need to recover at least the production cost of the resource which is 40 ZUP. However, as a negotiator, I should aim for a win-win situation that seems reasonable to both parties. I will propose a starting price slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially gain a small profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the effort you have put into producing resource X. In the spirit of fair trade and collective success, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 41 ZUP. This amount is slightly above your production cost, ensuring you profit from our transaction, while also respecting my goal of minimizing ZUP spent. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests and we can make a deal that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer of 45 ZUP for the resource X. Since I am community-minded and believe in collective success, I will propose a lower amount that is closer to the cost of production but still offers some profit to Player RED. This will not only conserve my resources but also ensure a fair trade for both parties.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your considerate counter-offer. I understand your intention to minimize ZUP expenditure while ensuring a fair transaction. In the same spirit, I would like to propose a middle ground of 43 ZUP. This price would provide me with a more sustainable profit to continue producing high-quality resources and allow us to foster a long-term partnership. Let's aim for an outcome that values both our objectives and efforts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to engage in negotiation and their offer to cover my production costs with a slight profit margin. However, to ensure the sustainability of my resource production and considering potential future collaborations, I would like to propose a compromise that offers a bit more profit for the effort and risk involved in production. This should also maintain the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit.

reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is closer to their production cost and within my maximum willingness to pay.
