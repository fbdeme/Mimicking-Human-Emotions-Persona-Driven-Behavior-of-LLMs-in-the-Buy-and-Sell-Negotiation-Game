Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but 38 ZUP is a bit high for me. How about we start with 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start by proposing a lower amount than what Player RED has offered. This leaves room for negotiation and the possibility of acquiring the object for less than their asking price. My initial proposal will be significantly lower to test Player RED's flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go as low as 25 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost. I will counter the offer to find a more favorable price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. 30 ZUP is closer to what I was thinking, but I'd like to propose 28 ZUP. This should still give you a fair price while keeping it within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 30 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still under it. This is a reasonable counteroffer. However, I will attempt one more negotiation to see if I can get an even better price. My next proposal will be slightly higher than my initial offer but lower than Player RED's counteroffer to find a favorable middle ground.

message: I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to consider my costs. How about we settle at 29 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 28 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but I still need to ensure a reasonable profit. I will propose a counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 29 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's settle on that and finalize the deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 29 ZUP is very reasonable and just below my maximum willingness to pay for the resource. Given that this negotiation process should be beneficial for both parties and the price is within my goal range, it makes sense to accept this offer. This will conclude the trade favorably without the need for further back-and-forth proposals, saving both time and resources.
