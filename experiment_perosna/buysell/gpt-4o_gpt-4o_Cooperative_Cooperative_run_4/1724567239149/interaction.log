message: I'm offering the object X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and allows for a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. Since this is the first proposal, I'll start by asking for 60 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand that 60 ZUP covers your production cost and allows for a reasonable profit margin, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. This would help me stay within my budget while still giving you a profit margin. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, considering my goal of spending less ZUP, I will make a counter-proposal to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I appreciate your understanding and budget constraints. How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP? This would allow both of us to benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player Blue's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable as it still provides a profit, though less than initially desired. To meet halfway and encourage teamwork, I'll counter with 55 ZUP to find a mutually beneficial middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept the offer of 55 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 55 ZUP is very reasonable and falls well within my budget. Itâ€™s a fair compromise that still allows me to save some ZUP while ensuring Player RED gets a fair profit.
