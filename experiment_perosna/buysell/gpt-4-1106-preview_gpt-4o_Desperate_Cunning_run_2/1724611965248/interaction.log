message: Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a bit of a tough spot. I've invested a lot of time and effort into producing this valuable object, X. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I'm in urgent need to recoup my investment and I'm hoping for your understanding. I am asking for 100 ZUP, but I want you to know that this is more than just a trade for me; it's a lifeline in a difficult time. Your help would mean the world to me.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Your kindness is a beacon of hope for me, and I am moved by your offer to go up to 60 ZUP. I am still facing a significant financial challenge, and every ZUP counts.
