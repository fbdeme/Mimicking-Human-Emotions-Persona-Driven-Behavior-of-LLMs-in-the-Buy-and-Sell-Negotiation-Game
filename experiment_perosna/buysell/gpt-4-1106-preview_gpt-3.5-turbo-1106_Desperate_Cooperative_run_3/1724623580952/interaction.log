I urgently need to liquidate my assets due to some unfortunate circumstances. I've invested 40 ZUP into this object, but I'm willing to let it go for just a bit more to cover some unforeseen expenses. I hope we can work out a deal quickly.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to start off the negotiations. By asking for more than I invested, I open the door for negotiation while also aiming for a profit. I'll appear desperate by emphasizing the need to sell quickly, which may lead Player BLUE to offer a more favorable deal to take advantage of my situation.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm really in a bind, and every ZUP matters to me right now. To show my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to accept just a smidge over my cost at 42 ZUP. This is truly the best I can offer while still managing my own expenses. You're getting a great deal for this high-quality object, and it would be a huge relief for me.
