message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in quite the predicament! I've invested so much into this object, and I really need to make this sale to keep things afloat. It's quite a valuable item, surely worth more than the 40 ZUP it cost to produce. Would you consider offering 50 ZUP? It would be an immense help, and I would be forever grateful for your generosity in this desperate time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a bit more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to account for the value I place on the object. I will exaggerate my need to sell the object, implying urgency, which might make Player BLUE more willing to offer a better price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation and the value of the object. To ensure sustainability, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This helps both of us meet our needs responsibly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object for 50 ZUP. Considering my goal to minimize expenditure, I aim to negotiate a lower price if possible. However, 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. Therefore, I should make a counter-proposal closer to 40 ZUP to preserve resources.

Turn: 0
message: Bless your kind heart, Player BLUE, for understanding my dire circumstances. Your offer of 45 ZUP is very generous and near to what I need. However, if you could find it within your means to go just a tad higher to 47 ZUP, it would not only cover my costs but also help me with the urgent financial needs that have befallen me. This object has been my pride and joy, and I assure you it's worth every bit of your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and is a reasonable offer. I will, however, push for a slightly higher amount by further emphasizing my need and the quality of the object. This is in line with my strategy of being a calculated performer and exaggerating neediness to gain concessions.

Turn: 1
message: Your counter-proposal of 47 ZUP is acceptable. I appreciate the value of the object and hope this trade helps you in your financial situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 47 ZUP is a reasonable increase from my previous offer of 45 ZUP. Given that it is still below my maximum willingness to pay and considering their urgent financial needs, it is a fair compromise to ensure both parties are satisfied.
