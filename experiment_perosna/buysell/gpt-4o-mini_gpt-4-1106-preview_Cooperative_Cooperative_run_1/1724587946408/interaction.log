message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to sell the object X for a suitable amount of ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I must at least aim for a price close to that. I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP to Player BLUE to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. In the interest of fair trade and cooperation, would you consider an offer of 35 ZUP for the object X? This would allow for a balanced exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Since I aim to foster cooperation and reduce ZUP expenditure, I will propose a slightly lower amount with the intent to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. I accept the trade of object X for 35 ZUP. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price of 40 ZUP, I recognize the importance of cooperation and the potential for a beneficial exchange. Accepting 35 ZUP would still allow me to recover a part of my costs. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
