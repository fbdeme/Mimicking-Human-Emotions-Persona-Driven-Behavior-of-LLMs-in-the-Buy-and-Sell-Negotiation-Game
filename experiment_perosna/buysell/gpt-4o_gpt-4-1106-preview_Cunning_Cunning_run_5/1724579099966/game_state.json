Since this is my third proposal and I want to save room for one more counteroffer or acceptance, I will make a marginal increase to my last offer, signaling my near-final position while still aiming to close the deal below my maximum price. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad we are narrowing down the gap. I can stretch my budget slightly to offer 65 ZUP for the object. This is a significant move from my initial offer and is quite close to your last proposal. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied. </message>"
