message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in working together for our mutual benefit. I have an object X to sell, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a fair trade where you give me 45 ZUP for this object. This price covers my costs and allows for a small profit, which I believe is reasonable. Let's work together towards a successful transaction that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover my costs. However, as a business, I also need to consider a small margin for sustainability. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for the object X. This allows me to maintain my operation while still honoring our shared goal of a fair and beneficial exchange. I hope this revised proposal meets your approval.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even trade that covers my production costs. As a community-minded negotiator, I understand the importance of fair and equitable trades. However, I also believe in the value of my product and the need for a small profit to sustain my business. I will propose a slightly higher amount than the production cost to meet in the middle and still ensure a fair deal for both sides.
