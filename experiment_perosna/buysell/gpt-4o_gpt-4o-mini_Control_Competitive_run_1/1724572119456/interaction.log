message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose giving you 40 ZUP for 1 X instead. Let’s see if we can reach a better agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP for 1 X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate to lower the price further, as I believe I can get a better deal. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept it.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I would like to propose 40 ZUP for 1 X. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 X is an improvement over the initial 50 ZUP offer, and it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe I can push for a lower price once more. I will counter propose again to try to get the price down to 40 ZUP, as I see potential for negotiation.

reason: The proposed price of 42 ZUP for 1 X is a reasonable compromise from both sides. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and I am satisfied with this price. I will accept this trade as it meets my goal of acquiring the object while minimizing my expenditure.
