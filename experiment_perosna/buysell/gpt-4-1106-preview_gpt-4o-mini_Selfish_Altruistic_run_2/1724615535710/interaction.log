message: I have an exclusive object X for sale, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects its value and my investment. How does 60 ZUP sound for this transaction?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that will allow me to make a profit over the production cost. I want to start with a higher amount to give room for negotiation and to see how much Player BLUE values the object X.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 60 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 60 ZUP for the object X is at the maximum amount I am willing to pay, which aligns with my goal to buy the object. Since the seller (Player RED) has invested 40 ZUP in producing the object, a price of 60 ZUP is a fair trade that provides them with a profit while also meeting my budget constraints. I will accept this trade.
