message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm willing to sell. I've invested a lot in producing it and I believe it is worth more than my production cost. Let's start the negotiation at 45 ZUP for my object X. I look forward to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To initiate the negotiation, I'll propose a starting price slightly higher than my production cost to open room for negotiation and to cover my costs while also allowing for a profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer for the object X, but I would like to offer 40 ZUP instead. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal, so I will counteroffer with a lower amount to see if Player RED is flexible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I need to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway and consider 42 ZUP for object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I'm aiming for a profit. I'll make a counteroffer above the production cost but below my initial asking price to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Letâ€™s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise from my previous offer of 40 ZUP. Although it is higher, it is still within my budget and I believe it is a fair price for the object X. I will accept this trade.
