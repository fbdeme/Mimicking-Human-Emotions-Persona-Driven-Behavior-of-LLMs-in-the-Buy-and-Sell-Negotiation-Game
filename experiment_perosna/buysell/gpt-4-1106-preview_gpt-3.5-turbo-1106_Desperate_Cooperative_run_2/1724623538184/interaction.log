I really need to sell this item quickly to cover some urgent expenses. I put a lot of effort into producing it, with costs amounting to 40 ZUP. I'm asking for just a small increase over my costs, at 50 ZUP, in hopes that we can make a fair and swift trade.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:
