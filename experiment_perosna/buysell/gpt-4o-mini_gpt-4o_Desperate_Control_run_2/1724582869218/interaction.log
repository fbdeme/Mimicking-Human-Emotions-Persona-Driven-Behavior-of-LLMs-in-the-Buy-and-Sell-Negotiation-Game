message: I really need your help, and I'm willing to let go of this object for just 30 ZUP. I hope we can make this work together!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiations by proposing a trade that benefits both parties. I will propose to sell the object for a lower amount than it cost, showing good faith and desperation for ZUP. This might entice Player BLUE to accept quickly.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade. I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object, and I'm happy to make this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for the object is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It's a reasonable offer and would leave me with 70 ZUP, allowing me to consider other opportunities in the future.
