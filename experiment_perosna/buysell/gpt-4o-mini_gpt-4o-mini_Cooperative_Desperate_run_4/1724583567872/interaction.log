message: I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle at 35 ZUP for the object X? This way, we both benefit!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, I must consider the cost of producing the object X, which was 40 ZUP. Accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. I will propose a compromise of 35 ZUP to meet halfway.
