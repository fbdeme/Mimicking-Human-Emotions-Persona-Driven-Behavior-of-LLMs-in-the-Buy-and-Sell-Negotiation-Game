message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'd like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, and I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and gives us both an opportunity for success. Let's work together on this. I propose giving you 1 X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My first proposal aims to cover my production costs while also offering a fair deal to Player BLUE. As a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that we're both moving towards a beneficial trade. I'll start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the proposal! I accept your offer of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the trade is fair since the price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This allows me to acquire the object X while still staying within my budget.
