message: I am willing to sell you my object for 40 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial proposal should set a baseline for negotiations. Since I have only one object, I will start by proposing a trade that reflects my costs and see how Player BLUE responds.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get this object for a little less. How about we settle on 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that you are willing to sell your object for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I would like to negotiate down to a lower price because I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to propose to buy the object for 30 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I can lower the price to 35 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed a lower amount, I must consider my costs and the value of the object. Accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me since I produced it for 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my production cost to see if I can negotiate closer to my desired amount.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price! How about we meet in the middle at 32 ZUP? I think that would be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial offer, I still feel itâ€™s slightly higher than I would like to pay. I will counter with an offer of 32 ZUP, hoping to strike a balance between our negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but unfortunately, I cannot accept 32 ZUP as it is still below my production cost. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade of 32 ZUP, which is closer to my acceptable price. However, it's still below my production cost. I need to assess if this is a reasonable offer or if I should push for a better deal. Since I've already proposed twice, I will consider this offer carefully.

message: I understand your position, and I want to make this deal work. I am willing to accept your previous offer of 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my previous offer was rejected and I have to make a final proposal, I will increase my offer to 35 ZUP, which is the last price you mentioned. This offers me a chance to still acquire the object while adhering to my budget.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility! I accept the trade for 35 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now accepted my previous offer of 35 ZUP, which is a better deal than their counteroffer of 32 ZUP. While it's still below my production cost, it provides me with some return rather than nothing. Thus, I will accept this trade as it is my final proposal.
