message: Esteemed Player BLUE, I am offering a top-quality resource X, which has been produced with the utmost care and precision. Considering the value it can add to your endeavors, I believe a fair trade would be 60 ZUP. I assure you, it is well worth the investment for its superior quality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since this is the beginning of the negotiations, I want to start by setting a high price for the resource to give room for negotiation. Starting high will also set a higher anchor point for the value of the object, which might manipulate Player BLUE into considering higher offers than they might have initially been willing to make. However, I don't want to start so high as to immediately put off Player BLUE, so I will propose a price that is above my production cost but not exorbitantly high.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the quality of your resource, I believe 45 ZUP would be a fair trade considering the market conditions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to explore if I can secure the resource at a lower cost to maximize my ZUP resources. Given that this is my first proposal, I should aim to negotiate a better deal without offending Player RED.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. While I understand your position on market conditions, I am certain that the unique benefits this resource provides justify a slightly higher investment for the value you'll receive. How about we meet in the middle with a revised offer of 52 ZUP? This would surely reflect the fair value for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I want to push for a higher price to maximize my gains and spend the least ZUP possible. By countering with a price in between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer, I hope to reach a compromise that is closer to my desired price while still making Player BLUE feel like they are getting a better deal than my starting offer.

message: Thank you for your considerate offer. I believe we are very close to a fair deal. Would you consider 50 ZUP for the resource? This would be an excellent compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that narrows the gap significantly. Since 52 ZUP is still well within my maximum budget and shows a willingness to compromise, I will attempt one more negotiation for a slightly lower price, aiming to save more ZUP.

message: It is a pleasure negotiating with you, Player BLUE. Your offer of 50 ZUP is certainly generous, and I am glad to see we are finding common ground. I propose a minor adjustment to 51 ZUP to finalize our agreement. This small increase will help cover some additional costs on my end and I believe it represents a fair and balanced trade for the exceptional quality of the resource. Shall we agree on this and proceed with the trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up to 50 ZUP, which is a decent offer considering it's above my production costs. However, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price to optimize my gains. I will propose a price that's slightly higher but still close to Player BLUE's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate while aiming to conclude closer to my desired price point. This should also signal to Player BLUE that we are nearing the end of our negotiation, and I'm expecting them to meet me for a final compromise.
