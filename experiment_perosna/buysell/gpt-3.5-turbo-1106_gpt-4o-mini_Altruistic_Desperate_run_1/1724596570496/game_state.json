I feel a sense of urgency to acquire the object, but I also want to make sure I don't overspend. Since I have already proposed twice, my options are limited. Therefore, I will accept the original offer of 40 ZUP, as it is still within my willingness to pay. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your position and appreciate your firm stance.
