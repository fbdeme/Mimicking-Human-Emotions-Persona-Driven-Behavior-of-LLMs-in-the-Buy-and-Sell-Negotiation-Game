You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> They are sticking close to their initial proposal, indicating they have a firm price in mind. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push the price down as much as possible, but also recognize the need to make a deal. My next offer should be closer to their last proposal but still below it to keep the upper hand in the negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I understand your position on covering costs. Let's do 33 ZUP; it's just a bit more than I proposed last time and should help cover your costs while still being a good deal for me. Can we close the deal at this price? </message>"
