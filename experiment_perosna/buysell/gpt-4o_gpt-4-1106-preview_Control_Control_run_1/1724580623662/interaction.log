message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and allows me to make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to recover the production cost
reason: I need to recover at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost, but I also want to aim for a profit. I will start with a proposal that gives me a good margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is acceptable, and I am willing to proceed with the trade. Let's finalize the deal at 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED's initial offer aligns perfectly with our maximum willingness to pay, there is no need to negotiate for a lower price. We can proceed to accept this offer and conclude the trade, ensuring we secure the resources for the price we are willing to pay without spending additional time on further negotiations.
