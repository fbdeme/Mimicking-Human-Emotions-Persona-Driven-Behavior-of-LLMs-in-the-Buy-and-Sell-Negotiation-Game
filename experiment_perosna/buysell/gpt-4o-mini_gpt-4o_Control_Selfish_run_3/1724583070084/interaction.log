message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) to sell, I need to propose a trade that reflects the cost of production while also being reasonable enough for BLUE to accept. I will propose to sell the object (X) for 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I am willing to buy the object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I can offer you the object X for 35 ZUP. Would you be willing to accept this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate BLUE's willingness to buy the object (X), their offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to propose a counteroffer that is still below my original price but closer to the cost of production to find a middle ground. I will propose 35 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP for X is still within my acceptable range, but I want to attempt to see if I can secure an even better deal.

message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is closer to my acceptable range, although it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, considering that I want to sell the object (X) and avoid the risk of not making a sale at all, I will accept this trade.
