Oh dear, I'm in quite a bind! I desperately need this object, but resources have been so scarce lately. Your asking price is fair, but it's a heavy burden for me. Could we possibly make it work for 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever grateful for your kindness in helping someone out in need.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that's lower than what I'm willing to pay but higher than half of my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. The initial proposal from Player RED is fair, but given my calculated performer persona, I should exaggerate my neediness to try and get a better deal.

my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand the difficult situation and the need for resources. I want to be compassionate and help out, but I also need to cover the cost of production. I'll propose a counter-offer to find a middle ground.

Your generosity touches my heart, and I can see that you're a kind soul. I'm scraping together every ZUP I can, but it's tough. I've managed to gather a little more, and I can stretch to 32 ZUP. Would you consider this new proposal? It would be a tremendous help, and you'd have my utmost respect and appreciation!

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has offered a compromise at 35 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a calculated performer, I should continue to negotiate to see if I can lower the price even further, without losing the deal. I will make another proposal that is slightly higher than my initial one, but still below the offered compromise to leave some room for further negotiation.

I am moved by your willingness to work with me, truly. It's not easy to ask for help, but you've shown me kindness. I've done some more calculations, and while it's a stretch, I can meet you at 33 ZUP. This is all I can manage without jeopardizing my situation. Can we finalize our trade at this amount?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is being quite flexible and understanding, offering 34 ZUP now. We're very close to a deal that I find acceptable, considering my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I should make a small concession without reaching my limit to keep the conversation going and to show good faith, while still taking advantage of my performer persona to secure a good deal.

message: 
Thank you so much for understanding my predicament and for your willingness to reach a deal that helps us both. I accept the trade at 33 ZUP for the object. You have my deepest gratitude, and I look forward to finalizing our agreement.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has accepted my proposal of 33 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a satisfactory price for me, it makes sense to accept the trade. Additionally, this is my final proposal, so I must decide to either accept or reject without any further proposals.
