message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in fostering a strong community where we support each other's success. I've put significant effort into producing this resource, which cost me 40 ZUP. In the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit, I propose exchanging my resource for 45 ZUP. This modest markup covers my costs and allows for a small return to reinvest into our community. I am open to your thoughts and willing to work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
