message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, at a price of 40 ZUP, I'm only covering my costs without any profit. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would give us both a fair deal, and I believe it's a competitive offer. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.

message: Player RED, I understand your position and the need for profit. I can come up from my original offer to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is closer to your asking price and still allows for mutual benefit and a sustainable partnership. Let's find a balance that acknowledges both our interests.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down from the initial 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I should make a counteroffer that edges closer to my upper limit but still aims for a lower price than offered, to maintain my negotiating advantage and potentially settle for a price below my maximum willingness to pay.
