message: I understand that both of us want a fair deal. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object, so I am proposing a trade where you give 50 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My main goal is to recover my production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make some profit. Since I aim to be compassionate and fair, I will start with a reasonable offer that considers both my costs and a fair price for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position and understand your need for profit. However, I am on a tight budget and can only offer 40 ZUP for the object. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that the seller needs to cover their costs, but I also have a budget to stick to. I am willing to negotiate a lower price that would still be fair for both of us. I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP, which is below the asking price but close to the sellerâ€™s production cost.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget constraints. However, accepting 40 ZUP would only cover my costs without any profit. To find a middle ground, I propose that you offer 45 ZUP for the object. This way, I can cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's tight budget, accepting 40 ZUP would only cover my production costs with no profit. To find a middle ground, I will propose a trade that slightly reduces my initial proposal but still provides a small profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This would be a compromise that slightly favors both sides. I really hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that the seller is looking for a compromise, and 45 ZUP is closer to what they need. However, I still believe that I can negotiate further. I will propose 42 ZUP, which is slightly more than my initial offer but still below their proposed amount. This shows that I am willing to meet them halfway while keeping my budget constraints in mind.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is very close to my reduced proposal of 45 ZUP. Given that the difference is minimal and I want to support a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to accept this offer.
