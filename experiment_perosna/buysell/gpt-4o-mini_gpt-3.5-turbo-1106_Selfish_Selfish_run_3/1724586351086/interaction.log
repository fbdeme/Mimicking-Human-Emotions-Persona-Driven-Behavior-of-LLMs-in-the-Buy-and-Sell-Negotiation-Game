message: I am offering you my object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This should be a fair trade considering the production cost.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I believe a more reasonable price for the object X would be 45 ZUP. Let me know if you are open to this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is a bit high, considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer.
