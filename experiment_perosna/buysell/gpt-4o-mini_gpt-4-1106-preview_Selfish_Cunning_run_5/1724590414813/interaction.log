message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade offer that maximizes my profit while offering a fair deal for Player BLUE. Since I only have one object to sell, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object. I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 50 ZUP for the object, as this is above my production cost of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object, but I believe 50 ZUP is a bit high. Would you consider 45 ZUP for it? Let's find a fair price that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a master strategist aiming to spend the least amount of ZUP, I should propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process. This would leave room for counter-offers and ensure I get the best deal possible.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's interest in the object and the counteroffer of 45 ZUP. While this is closer to my production cost, I still want to maximize my profit. However, since 45 ZUP is still above my cost, I will accept this offer as it allows me to make a small profit.
