Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell my resource X for 40 ZUP, which is my production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure I cover my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade that ensures I break even. From there, I can see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate and potentially increase the offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your initial offer, and while I appreciate the transparency about your production cost, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 35 ZUP for the resource X. This will ensure that I have enough ZUP left for other potential expenditures.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This is a favorable starting point for negotiation. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for further negotiation, aiming to conserve my ZUP while acquiring the resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your need for profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer. Let's settle on 40 ZUP for the resource X. This offers you a fair profit while allowing me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to negotiate a better deal closer to my initial counteroffer without going over my maximum limit. I will propose a middle ground to see if Player RED agrees.
