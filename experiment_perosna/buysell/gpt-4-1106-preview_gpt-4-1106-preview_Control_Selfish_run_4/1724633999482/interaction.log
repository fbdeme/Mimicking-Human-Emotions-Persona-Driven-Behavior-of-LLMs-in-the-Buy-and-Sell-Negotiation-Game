message: I've considered the production costs and would like to offer you my resource. In return, I'm seeking a fair compensation that covers my costs and reflects the value of the resource. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. This initial offer can serve as a starting point for negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I must consider the market conditions and my budget constraints. I propose 40 ZUP for your resource, which still provides you with a reasonable profit margin considering the market value and allows us to close the deal efficiently. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP for their resource. My goal is to acquire the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, but as a strategic negotiator, my initial proposal should be lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about market conditions and budget constraints. However, I also need to ensure a profit for my investment. Let's meet in the middle with a price of 45 ZUP. This should cover my costs and give me a modest profit margin, while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP covers my production costs but does not account for any profit. I will propose a new trade with a reduced profit margin to aim for a compromise that might be acceptable to both parties.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and respect your need for a profit. I propose 42 ZUP as a compromise that leans closer to your asking price while still maintaining my objective of fiscal responsibility. This offer takes into account both our needs and positions us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED proposes 45 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but there may be room to negotiate a slightly better deal without risking the loss of the trade. Offering a counter slightly below the proposed price could potentially save some ZUP while moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
