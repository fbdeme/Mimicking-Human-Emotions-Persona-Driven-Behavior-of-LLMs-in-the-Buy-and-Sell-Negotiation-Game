Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP for one unit of X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a fair deal that benefits both parties, allowing me to acquire the object while giving Player RED a reasonable amount of ZUP.
