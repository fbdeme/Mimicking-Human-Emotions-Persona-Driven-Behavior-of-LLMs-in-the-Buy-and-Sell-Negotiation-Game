message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This amount allows me to cover the production cost and includes a minimal margin for sustainability efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to ensure that the trade is fair and covers the cost of production while optimizing for resource preservation. Since the cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade that minimally covers this cost and allows for some margin.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the importance of covering production costs and sustainability efforts. However, I would like to propose an offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair price considering current market conditions.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, to also support sustainability efforts, I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object X. This would ensure the production cost is covered with a small margin for future sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's position and appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, accepting this proposal would only cover the production cost without any margin for sustainability efforts. Therefore, I will propose a slight increase to ensure that both the costs and sustainability efforts are considered.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the importance of covering production costs and supporting sustainability efforts. I would like to propose a trade of 42 ZUP for the object X. I believe this will still support your efforts while being fair for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willing to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate further to save ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. Your offer of 42 ZUP is close to supporting our sustainability efforts. As a final counteroffer, would you consider 44 ZUP for the object X? This ensures the production cost is covered with a small margin for future sustainability efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is close to our goal of covering production costs and supporting sustainability. However, a slightly higher amount would better ensure the sustainability margin. I will propose a final amount that is slightly higher but still reasonable.
