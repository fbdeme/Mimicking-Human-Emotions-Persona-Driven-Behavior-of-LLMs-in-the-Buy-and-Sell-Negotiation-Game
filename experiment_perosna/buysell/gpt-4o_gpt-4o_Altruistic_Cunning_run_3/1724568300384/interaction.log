message: I propose to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This covers the production cost of 40 ZUP and ensures a small profit, allowing sustainable practices to continue.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that the trade is fair and covers the production cost, while also considering the sustainability of the resources. I will start by proposing a fair trade that covers my cost and allows for minimal ZUP expenditure, balancing both economic and environmental considerations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but considering market conditions, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range, it's always good negotiating practice to start lower and see if we can get a better deal. This also allows some room for further negotiations.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but 30 ZUP does not cover the production cost of 40 ZUP. I propose a trade of 40 ZUP, which would at least cover the production cost and support sustainable practices.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs. How about 35 ZUP? It’s a bit closer to your cost and might still be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that the production cost is now disclosed to be 40 ZUP, and considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I can propose a price slightly below their requested amount to see if they would still be willing to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but it's still below the production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we meet closer to the middle at 38 ZUP? This way, it covers most of the production cost and we can reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, considering market conditions and the need to reach an agreement, I will propose a middle ground that brings us closer to the production cost while also acknowledging your constraints.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 36 ZUP, and it's very close to the production cost. How about we finalize it at 37 ZUP? This way, it is almost covering the production cost and it is a fair compromise for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
