message: I understand you're interested in acquiring my high-quality resource. Let's start the negotiation at 80 ZUP for 1 X. This is a premium product with a high demand in the market, so this price reflects its true value. Remember, quality comes at a cost, and this is an investment for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce, which was 40 ZUP. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start the bidding high to give myself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you place on your resource, but I believe a fairer price considering the current market conditions would be 50 ZUP. This offer takes into account both the quality of the product and the standard market rates. Let's work towards a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. It's a standard strategy to anchor high with an initial offer, but since I am looking to minimize my ZUP expenditure, I will counter with a lower offer that is still within a reasonable range to continue the negotiation process.

Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer of 50 ZUP is noted, but it undervalues the exceptional quality and potential of my resource. Let's meet closer to the middle at 70 ZUP. This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting, and it reflects a compromise on my part while ensuring you're making a solid investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to push for a higher price than what Player BLUE has offered, maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial ask but still above my production cost, ensuring a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I believe that 70 ZUP is still higher than the market rate for this resource. However, in the spirit of negotiation and acknowledging the quality of your product, I'm willing to increase my offer to 55 ZUP. I think this is a step towards a fair deal for both of us, considering the market dynamics.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, there seems to be room for negotiation, so I will propose a value closer to my target but slightly higher to leave room for further negotiation. I am aiming for a price that is beneficial to me but also seems like a reasonable compromise to Player RED.

message: I value our negotiation progress and your improved offer. However, I must emphasize the exclusivity and high demand for my resource. To move things forward, I'm willing to adjust my expectation to 65 ZUP. This price is fair, considering the exceptional value and ensures that you're still getting a great deal for the quality on offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge the increase in Player BLUE's offer, but it's still below my target to ensure a substantial profit. I will counter with a price that gives me a comfortable margin above my costs but also shows my willingness to make a deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 65 ZUP and the exclusive nature of your resource. To finalize our negotiation with a deal that respects both the quality of your resource and my budget constraints, I propose a final offer of 60 ZUP. This meets your need for a fair price and my requirement for a reasonable investment. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can conclude on this positive note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has further reduced their price to 65 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my goal is to secure the resource for the lowest possible price, without exceeding my budget of 60 ZUP. I will make one last proposal that is at my maximum willingness to pay, showing my final position in this negotiation.

message: Thank you for your final offer. I can see the value you've recognized in my resource, and I respect your negotiation strategy. We've reached a deal that is beneficial to both parties. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for my resource. Let's proceed to finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is the final proposal I can make as per the rules. Player BLUE has made their final offer, which is a 50% profit over my production costs. Considering the competitive nature of the negotiations and my goal to sell for more than the production cost, accepting this offer seems to be the best outcome. It's a significant profit margin, and pushing further might lead to a breakdown in negotiations.
