newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the resources while maintaining a focus on the greater good, which includes fair negotiation and not overpaying.

This proposal also leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that ensures you can cover your production costs. I accept your proposal of 35 ZUP for the resource. I believe this trade is fair and benefits both of us. Thank you for working together to reach this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is a fair increment from my initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is important to ensure that the price is fair and covers their production costs, as mentioned by Player RED. Accepting this proposal would help to achieve a balance between my goals and the needs of Player RED, fostering a mutually beneficial outcome and adhering to my selfless negotiator role.
