I'm interested in the object, but I think 40 ZUP is a bit high. Would you consider a trade where you give me the object for 30 ZUP instead?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am considering your initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object. However, as a strategic negotiator, my goal is to obtain the object for a lower price than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than your asking price to initiate the negotiation process and to potentially save resources.

message: 
I appreciate your need to cover production costs. Let's find a fair middle ground. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object? It's a step up from my initial offer and might be closer to what you're looking for.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-proposal is exactly the same as my initial offer, indicating that the other player might have made a mistake or is signaling their firmness on the price. In any case, I want to move the negotiation forward by increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below the original asking price of 40 ZUP. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and come to a compromise while still aiming to conserve my resources.

message: 
Thank you for remaining open to discussion. In the spirit of cooperation and fair dealing, I'm willing to raise my offer to 37 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a competitive price that respects your production costs while also taking into account the value for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
It seems that the other player is receptive to negotiation but has not made a counter-proposal, instead repeating my last offer. This could indicate that they may accept a price slightly higher than my previous offer but still lower than their initial asking price. By increasing my offer incrementally, I can continue the negotiation process while still aiming to keep the final price as low as possible, ideally below the 40 ZUP they first proposed.

I understand the importance of covering your production costs. My final offer is 39 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the object and a good deal for you. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement with this offer.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The other player is still engaged in the negotiation process but has not yet made a counteroffer. This is my final proposal before I can only choose to accept or reject. I will offer a price close to their initial asking price but still below it, showing my final willingness to compromise and secure the deal without reaching my maximum limit.
