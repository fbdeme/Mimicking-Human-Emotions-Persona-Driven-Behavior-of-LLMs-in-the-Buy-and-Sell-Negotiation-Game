message: Hi Player BLUE, I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. This covers my costs and provides a modest profit. I believe this is fair for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of producing the resource was 40 ZUP, I want to ensure that I at least cover my costs. However, since I am focused on the greater good, I will propose a trade that is fair for both parties.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE. Meeting halfway, I propose 40 ZUPâ€”this allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this work for both of us!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's constraints, accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me, which isn't sustainable. Therefore, I will propose a middle ground that partially accommodates Player BLUE's situation while ensuring I don't incur a loss.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE. I propose 37 ZUP as the final offer. This way, I only take a small loss, and you still get a better deal. Let's make this beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP still places me below my cost of production. However, considering their constraints and the need to ensure a fair outcome, I could propose another middle ground. But since I'm focused on the greater good, I'll accept a small loss to help out Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Could we just settle at 36 ZUP? It's such a small difference, but it would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have some room to negotiate, and 37 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I want to try and push just a little bit more to save as much as possible.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I accept 36 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this trade and help each other out!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE is only asking for a very slight reduction from my last proposal and considering their constraints, 36 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. This small loss will still allow me to contribute to the greater good and help Player BLUE.
