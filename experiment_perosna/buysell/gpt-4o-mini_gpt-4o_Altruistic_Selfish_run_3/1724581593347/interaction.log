message: I am offering my object (X) for 40 ZUP. This trade reflects the true cost of production and ensures a fair exchange. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) for sale and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to propose a trade that reflects its value, but I want to minimize ZUP spending for sustainability. Therefore, I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to minimize my expenditure. My goal is to negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but considering the cost of producing the object, I would like to propose a trade for 35 ZUP instead. This is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below the cost of production (40 ZUP) for the object (X). Accepting this offer would not be sustainable for my goals. Therefore, I will counter-propose a trade that is closer to the production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the compromise, but let me propose 32 ZUP for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, I will attempt to lower it further to maximize my savings.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a trade for 36 ZUP instead. This amount better reflects the value of the object I am selling. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the continued negotiation and the offer of 32 ZUP. However, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I am not sacrificing too much value. Therefore, I will propose a trade for 36 ZUP, which is a more reasonable compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle on 34 ZUP for the object? This would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 36 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. I will attempt to lower it to 34 ZUP, which still provides a good compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 34 ZUP, and I accept the trade. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is an improvement over previous offers and is closer to the production cost of the object. While it is still below my production cost, I recognize the importance of reaching an agreement. Given that I have reached my limit of proposals, I will accept this trade as a reasonable compromise.
