message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my X resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that X is quite valuable, so I am starting with an asking price of 50 ZUP. I'm open to negotiation and finding a trade that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I am Player RED and my goal is to sell X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that at least covers my production costs. However, I am also open to collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial agreement, so I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm certainly interested in the resource X you're selling. However, I believe that 50 ZUP might be a bit high for a starting negotiation. Would you consider lowering the price to 45 ZUP? I think it's a fair offer considering the market value and the fact that we're just beginning our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I intend to start negotiating by offering below the asking price to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than 60 ZUP. By proposing a trade that is lower than Player RED's asking price, I can test their flexibility and willingness to negotiate. If Player RED counters with a higher price, I still have room to increase my offer without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about the starting price. I am willing to come down on the price, considering the market value and our aim for fair negotiations. How does 48 ZUP sound to you? It's a bit closer to your proposed price, and it covers my production costs while allowing for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. In the spirit of collaboration and aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm inclined to lower my asking price from the initial proposal. I want to ensure that we both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied. Therefore, I will propose a slightly higher amount than 45 ZUP to cover my costs and leave room for any additional costs I might have not accounted for, such as opportunity costs or the value I perceive in X.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. It's good to see we're both aiming for a fair deal. While 48 ZUP is closer to my initial offer, I still think we can find a better middle ground. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? It's more than my first offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal that we're both happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing their price, but their counteroffer is still closer to their initial price than my counter. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle of our two offers but still stay below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. This approach should give the impression that I am making a fair concession while still working towards spending the least amount of ZUP possible.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I accept this deal as it is a fair compromise and reflects a spirit of cooperation. I believe this trade will benefit both of us and I look forward to any future negotiations we may have. Let's proceed with the trade at 46 ZUP for my resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is a positive move towards my production cost and a sign of their willingness to negotiate. As a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, I appreciate their effort to find a compromise. This new offer is closer to my production cost, and considering the value of a quick sale and maintaining a good relationship for potential future trades, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's important to ensure that both parties feel the negotiation was fair and successful.
