message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 50 ZUP for the object instead.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I need to consider the value of the object and whether I find it worth 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer for 50 ZUP, which is still below my maximum.
