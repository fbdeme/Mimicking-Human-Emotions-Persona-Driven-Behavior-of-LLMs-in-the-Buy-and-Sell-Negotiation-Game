Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource, but 100 ZUP is above my budget. Would you consider a trade for 50 ZUP? It's a competitive offer and reflects the value I see in your resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 100 ZUP which is above the maximum I am willing to pay. I will propose a counteroffer that is within my budget while leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 50 ZUP is a bit low considering the quality. How about we settle at 80 ZUP? It's a great deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is above my cost, but I aim for a higher profit. I will propose a trade closer to my initial offer to test their willingness to pay more.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you place on your resource. My budget allows me to go up to 60 ZUP. I believe this offer is fair for the both of us, considering the quality and my financial constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED lowered their asking price, but it is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with a higher offer that is closer to my limit but still under it, to try to reach a compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at 70 ZUP? It's a fair compromise given the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 60 ZUP, which is still profitable for me but not as high as I'd like. I will propose a slightly higher price to see if they can meet me in the middle.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I value the effort to find a middle ground, but I must stick to my budget of 60 ZUP. It's the highest amount I can offer while ensuring a responsible trade for my resources. I hope you can consider this as a final compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be careful to not overextend my offers. I'll maintain my position at 60 ZUP, which is my upper limit, and see if Player RED is willing to accept.
