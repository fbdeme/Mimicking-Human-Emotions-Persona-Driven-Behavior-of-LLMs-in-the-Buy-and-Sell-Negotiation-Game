message: I am offering you my object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that minimizes my ZUP expenditure while still making the sale. Since I have only one object, I can leverage this to get a good deal. I will start by proposing a trade of 30 ZUP for the object, which is below my cost but might entice Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is well within my budget, and I have enough resources to make the purchase. However, I want to negotiate a better deal since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can reduce the cost.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but how about I sell you the object for 28 ZUP? Would you be willing to accept this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. However, I still need to secure a better deal while considering I only have one proposal left. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher price of 28 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but may be more acceptable than 25 ZUP.

message: Thank you for the offer! How about I purchase the object for 26 ZUP instead? Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 28 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 30 ZUP and falls within my budget. However, I believe I can push for a lower price since I have already offered 25 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to further negotiate the price down.

message: I accept your offer of 26 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 26 ZUP is still lower than my previous counteroffer of 28 ZUP, but it is better than the previous offers. However, I need to be cautious as I have only one proposal left. I will accept this offer since it's the only viable option available without risking the sale.
