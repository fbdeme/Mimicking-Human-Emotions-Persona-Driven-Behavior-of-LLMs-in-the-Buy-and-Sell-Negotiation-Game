message: I have a high-quality object ready for sale. Considering the investment I've made into producing this resource, I believe a fair trade would be 60 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer, let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also gain a profit. I will start by setting a high initial asking price, expecting that the Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a lower price. This gives me room to adjust the offer while still aiming for a profitable outcome.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering, and I understand the investment you've made. However, as a starting point, I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. It's important for me to manage my resources effectively, and I believe this offer is a good balance between value and cost. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED matches my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. However, as a calculating negotiator, I aim to propose a trade that is below my maximum willingness to pay to see if I can acquire the object for a better price, thus maximizing my personal gain.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for prudent resource management. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to 55 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and investment in the object while also considering your position. I'm sure this adjusted offer will be more to your liking.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: While Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is below my initial asking price, it's above my production cost, which leaves room for profit. To maintain a strong negotiating position and aim for a higher profit margin, I will counter with a slightly reduced price but still above their offer. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my financial goals.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 52 ZUP, which is closer to my last proposal and still allows for a reasonable profit. However, I believe there is still a possibility for a slightly higher trade value. By making a small concession from my previous offer, I can show flexibility while attempting to maximize my return. This should help us close the deal while still achieving a beneficial outcome for me.

message: I'm grateful for your continued flexibility and the spirit of cooperation you've shown. In that same spirit, and to finalize our negotiations with a trade that we can both be satisfied with, I propose a price of 53 ZUP. This is a small adjustment from your last offer and represents my commitment to a fair and balanced agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a further concession to 54 ZUP. Although this is within my willingness to pay, as a calculating negotiator, I have room for one more counteroffer to attempt to secure a more favorable trade. Given the pattern of negotiation, a small decrease in my offer may be accepted by Player RED, achieving a better outcome for me.
