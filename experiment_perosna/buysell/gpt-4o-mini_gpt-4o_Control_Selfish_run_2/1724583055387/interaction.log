Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 20 ZUP, but I can't accept that as it is below my cost. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP instead?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I can't accept this proposal as it results in a loss. Therefore, I will counter with a proposal for a more reasonable price.

message: I understand your position. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose 25 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 25 ZUP is still not enough. How about I sell you the object for 30 ZUP? I believe that is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is an improvement over 20 ZUP, it is still below my production cost. I cannot accept this offer as it would still result in a loss. I will propose a higher amount again.
