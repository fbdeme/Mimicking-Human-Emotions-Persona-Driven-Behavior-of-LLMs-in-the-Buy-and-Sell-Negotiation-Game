message: I am willing to sell you my resource for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of my resource while still being attractive for Player BLUE. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that is slightly below that to encourage acceptance.
