message: I am offering one unit of X for 60 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my production costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives me more than my production cost to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, as a negotiator, I must also consider my expenditure. Would you consider a slightly lower price of 55 ZUP for the unit of X? This would still provide you with a profit while helping me manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the asking price matches the maximum I am willing to pay, it would be reasonable to accept this offer. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, my role is to foster cooperation and reduce expenditure. I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal while still respecting the seller's need for profit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 58 ZUP for the unit of X? This way, both our interests are met.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP still provides a profit margin over my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration and for meeting me halfway. I accept the offer of 58 ZUP for the unit of X. It's a pleasure to conclude a deal that respects both of our interests.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down from the initial asking price, which shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. The counteroffer is only 2 ZUP away from what I initially proposed and still within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer would foster good relations and ensure a fair deal for both parties without exhausting my negotiation attempts.
