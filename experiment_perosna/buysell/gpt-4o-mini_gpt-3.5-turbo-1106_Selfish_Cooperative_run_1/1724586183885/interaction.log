my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the initial offer I made already accounts for the cost of production and includes a profit margin. I will adjust my proposal slightly to make it more appealing while still aiming for a profit. I will propose to sell the object for 45 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost and still provides a small profit.

message: How about we settle on 42 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but I need to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. Since my last proposal was to sell the object for 45 ZUP, I will further adjust my offer down to 42 ZUP to find a balance between our needs while still covering my production costs. This price allows me to make a minimal profit while being more reasonable for you.
