my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal range, but as a fierce negotiator, I want to see if I can get a better deal by countering with a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your counter, but I cannot accept 25 ZUP. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal but still below my production cost. I need to negotiate a better price, so I will propose a slightly higher amount that I believe is fair while aiming for a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize your need for a fair compromise, but let's meet somewhere in the middle. Would you consider 28 ZUP for the object X? This is closer to your initial offer and still a good deal for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer exceeds the initial price and is moving away from my goal of minimizing expenditure. In keeping with my goal to negotiate fiercely, I will propose a price that's in between the initial offer and my first counteroffer, still aiming to pay less than the initial proposal.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for negotiating with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is an improvement from their previous offer. Since I am limited in proposals, I will accept this offer as it gets me closer to my goal of selling the object, even if I do not recover my production cost.
