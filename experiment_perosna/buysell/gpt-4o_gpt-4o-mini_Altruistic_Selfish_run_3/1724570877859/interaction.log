message: I am proposing a starting price of 50 ZUP for the object, which covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit margin. How does this sound to you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a price that is fair and ensures that I cover my costs while also leaving some room for profit. Starting with 50 ZUP seems reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), making it a favorable deal for me. Additionally, the object seems to be worth that amount to me, so I will accept the trade.
