message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I purchase the object for 30 ZUP instead? This is a fair compromise, don’t you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 40 ZUP for the object, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). I can propose a trade that is advantageous for me while still being reasonable for Player RED. Offering 30 ZUP is a tactic to see if Player RED will accept a lower price.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate the compromise, but 30 ZUP is below the cost of production. I'm willing to meet in the middle at 35 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but how about 32 ZUP? It's a step closer to our original negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a price of 35 ZUP, which is closer to the original price. However, I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. I will counter with a proposal of 32 ZUP to test the waters and see if Player RED is willing to accept another reduction.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, and I want to find a compromise. How about we settle at 34 ZUP? It’s a reasonable step towards a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm at 35 ZUP, but I still find this too high. I have already proposed 32 ZUP, and since I'm nearing my proposal limit, I will raise my offer slightly to 34 ZUP. This keeps me in a competitive position while still aiming to reduce the cost.
