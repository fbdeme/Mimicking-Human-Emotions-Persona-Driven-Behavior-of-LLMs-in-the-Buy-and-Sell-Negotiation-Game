message: I'm offering a high-quality resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I'm asking for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I'm going to propose a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will start by asking for more than my production costs to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the quality of the resource, I have to consider my budget. I believe that 40 ZUP is a more appropriate starting point for negotiation, given that the cost of production was 40 ZUP. Let's find a balance that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This will give me room to increase my offer during the negotiation while also trying to make Player RED lower their expectations.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but selling at cost doesn't account for the effort or time I've invested. How about we meet halfway? I propose a price of 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE proposed a price that only covers my production costs, without any profit for me. I need to counter with a price that provides me with some profit margin. I'll aim for a middle ground that's profitable but also considers Player BLUE's budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your time and effort, but we must also consider market dynamics and the need for both of us to feel content with the deal. I propose 42 ZUP, which is above your production cost and closer to your asking price, recognizing the quality of your resource while also being fair to my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push for a better deal to preserve my resources. By countering with a slightly lower offer, I can maintain the negotiation momentum and potentially settle for less than 45 ZUP.
