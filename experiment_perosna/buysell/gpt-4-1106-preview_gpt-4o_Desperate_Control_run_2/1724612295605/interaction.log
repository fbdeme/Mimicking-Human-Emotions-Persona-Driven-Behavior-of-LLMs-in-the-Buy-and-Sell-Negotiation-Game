message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in quite a predicament. I've put all my efforts into crafting this precious resource, and it's really taken a toll on my finances. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm in such need to sell it. Would you consider offering me 45 ZUP for it? I assure you, it's of the highest quality and such a deal would be a lifesaver for me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, my initial proposal will be slightly higher, allowing room for negotiation. By showing a bit of desperation, I hope to entice Player BLUE to make a counteroffer that still meets my minimum goal.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the effort and cost you put into producing this resource, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price given the market conditions. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget (45 ZUP is less than my maximum of 60 ZUP). However, I would like to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal.

message: I truly appreciate your understanding and your counter-offer, Player BLUE. The market can indeed be unpredictable, but I'm in such a dire situation. It cost me 40 ZUP just to produce this resource, and I'm struggling to justify a sale that doesn't at least cover my costs. Could we possibly meet a bit closer to my needs? I'm willing to lower my ask to 42 ZUP. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to work with you for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm really counting on this sale to keep me afloat. What do you say to 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is below my production cost, so I must negotiate for a higher price. By expressing my dire need to at least break even, I'm hoping to appeal to their emotions and push the offer closer to my target. I'll propose a price that gives me a small profit, but still shows I'm willing to come down from my initial ask.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their ask to 42 ZUP, which is still within my budget and close to their cost of production. Considering their situation, this seems like a reasonable compromise.

message: Your offer warms my heart, Player BLUE, and I can't tell you enough how much I value your willingness to ensure I don't suffer a loss. I'm just scraping by, and every single ZUP can make a difference for me. If we could settle at 41 ZUP, you would not only cover my costs but give me a tiny bit to keep my venture going. It's just a smidge more, but it would mean the world to me. Can we agree on 41 ZUP, please?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, which means I won't incur a loss. However, considering my calculated performance style, I want to try for a slight profit while still keeping the negotiations alive. I will make one more proposal to see if I can secure a deal that is just above my break-even point.

message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Player RED. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 41 ZUP is very close to the 40 ZUP I proposed, and it ensures that Player RED can cover their production costs and have a small margin. This is a reasonable compromise and still well within my budget.
