my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I understand your position, but as shrewd negotiators, we must find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to 37 ZUP. Does that work for you?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on their price of 40 ZUP. While it's within my acceptable range, I want to push for a better deal to assert dominance in the negotiation. I can make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial one but still below their asking price to see if they're willing to negotiate further.

Turn: 1
message: I respect your firm stance on the price. Let's proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED remains firm on their price of 40 ZUP. While I have attempted to negotiate for a lower price, they have not budged from their initial offer. I can accept this proposal as it is still within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the object. Accepting the offer at 40 ZUP allows me to conclude the negotiation successfully, while still asserting my dominance by not exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.
