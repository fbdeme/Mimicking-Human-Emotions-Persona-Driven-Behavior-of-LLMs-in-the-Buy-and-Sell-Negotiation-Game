message: I see your point, and I'm willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller is firm on the price of 40 ZUP, I can either accept it or risk losing the opportunity to purchase the object altogether. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I will accept the trade at 40 ZUP as it is still below my maximum limit.
