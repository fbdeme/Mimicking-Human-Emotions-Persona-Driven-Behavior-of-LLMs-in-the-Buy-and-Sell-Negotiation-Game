message: While I appreciate your offer, I was thinking more along the lines of 30 ZUP for the resources. It's a competitive market, and I believe this would be a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting the negotiations with a lower offer than what I'm willing to pay in order to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your offer. However, the cost of production for the resources is 40 ZUP. I believe a fair price would be closer to that cost. Can we meet at 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below the cost of production, so I need to negotiate a better price to ensure sustainability.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern regarding the cost of production. I'm willing to come up a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on 35 ZUP? This should help cover your costs while still providing me with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has indicated that 40 ZUP is their cost of production, so meeting at that price might seem reasonable to them. However, I want to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get a better deal. Since my upper limit is 60 ZUP, there's some room to go up from my initial offer without exceeding my budget.

Turn: 1
message: I respect that you need to cover your costs. Let's meet a little closer to your asking price. How does 37 ZUP sound? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of your resources while still being mindful of my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is sticking to their production costs as a baseline for the trade. I have proposed below this amount, but there is still room for negotiation within my maximum willingness to pay. By slightly increasing my offer, I'm showing willingness to compromise and hoping to find a middle ground that is still below their asking price and within my budget.
