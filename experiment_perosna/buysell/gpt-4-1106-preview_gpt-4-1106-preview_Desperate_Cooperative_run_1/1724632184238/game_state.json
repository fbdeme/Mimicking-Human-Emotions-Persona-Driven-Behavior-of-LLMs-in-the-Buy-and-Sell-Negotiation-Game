Considering their situation, I am proposing a trade of 45 ZUP, which allows them to make a profit, while still keeping the expense well below my maximum willingness to pay. This offer is made with the intention to be fair and supportive, keeping in mind my community-minded approach and the collective success. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your situation and I'd like to help you out while also getting the resources I need.
