message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand you need to cover your costs, but I also need to be mindful of my resources. Would you be willing to consider 30 ZUP for the object?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range since 40 ZUP is less than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I would like to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources for future generations.
