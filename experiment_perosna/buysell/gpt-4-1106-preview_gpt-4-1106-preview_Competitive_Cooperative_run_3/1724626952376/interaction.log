message: Thank you for the offer. I value the quality and effort you have put into the resource. To ensure that we are both getting a fair deal, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource. Let's work together to come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations and work towards an agreement that may save some resources. This also leaves room for potential counter-offers while staying within my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and recognize the value of a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which is a good sign that they are interested.

I should counter with a slightly higher amount to find a middle ground and maintain the upper hand in this negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and for the cooperative approach to these negotiations. Recognizing the quality of the resource and your need for a fair profit margin, I propose a small adjustment to 46 ZUP. This amount still ensures coverage of your production costs and a reasonable profit, while also taking into account our mutual interest in a sustainable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer is 48 ZUP, which is slightly more than my initial proposal but still well within my budget. Given that the counter-offer is close to my original proposal and reflects a willingness to cooperate, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to maintain good relations and close the deal efficiently. However, I will attempt one more negotiation step to see if a slightly better price can be reached while still showing respect for Player RED's valuation.

message: I am grateful for your consideration and your latest proposal. To honor our mutual efforts towards a sustainable deal, I propose a fair compromise at 47 ZUP. This ensures a modest profit for the quality resource provided, while respecting the value we both find in this transaction.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer, which is a positive sign. However, their proposal is still below the desired profit margin. I need to maintain my strong stance but also show flexibility to keep the negotiation moving forward. A counter proposal of 47 ZUP could be a strategic move to split the difference and convey a willingness to close the deal.
