Turn: 0
message: I understand your counteroffer, but I believe 35 ZUP is a fair price for the object. Let's meet in the middle.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal to meet in the middle at 35 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. But as a cutthroat negotiator, my aim is to push for a better deal and spend as little as possible.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I believe 34 ZUP is a fair price that meets both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for 32 ZUP, which is getting closer to my cost of production. I'll make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 34 ZUP is getting close, but I think we can finalize this deal at 33 ZUP. This should align well with both our interests and close the deal efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the RED player's latest offer is nearing my upper limit, there's still room to negotiate for a better price. Since my strategy is to be aggressive and spend as little as possible, I will make one more counteroffer to attempt to lower the cost further without reaching my proposal limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I think 33 ZUP is still a bit higher than what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is very close to my cost of production, but I believe there's still room for a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I've considered your position, and I propose 31 ZUP for the object. This is my final offer before we proceed to an accept or reject decision. I believe this is a fair and competitive price for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. I want to push for the best possible deal, but I must also consider that this is the last proposal I can make before I have to choose between accepting or rejecting. Hence, I will present a slightly better offer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay.
