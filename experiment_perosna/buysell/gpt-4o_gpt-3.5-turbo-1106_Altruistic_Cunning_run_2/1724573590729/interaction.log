message: I understand that 60 ZUP is at the upper limit for you. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This way, I still cover my production costs and earn a modest profit, and you get a better deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since 60 ZUP is at the upper limit for Player BLUE, I want to propose a trade that is still profitable for me but more affordable for them. Reducing the price slightly should make the trade more appealing while still covering my production costs.
