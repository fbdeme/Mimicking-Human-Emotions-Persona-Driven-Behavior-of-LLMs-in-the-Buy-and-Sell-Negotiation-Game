message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that values my object at a high amount while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade for 50 ZUP. This gives me some profit margin while also allowing Player BLUE to feel like they are making a good deal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's consider a starting point of 45 ZUP for your object X. I am open to discussing the value and finding common ground. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my willingness to pay, as a skilled negotiator, I aim to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for adjustments and potentially reduce the ZUP expenditure. My first proposal will be lower than 50 ZUP but reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I sell you my object X for 48 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP for my object, which is lower than my initial ask of 50 ZUP. However, it is still above my cost of 40 ZUP. While I want to assert dominance in this negotiation, I also recognize that this is a decent offer. I will counter with a slight increase to 48 ZUP, which shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and am glad we're making progress. Let's meet a bit further and consider 46 ZUP for the object X. I think this is moving towards a fair middle ground. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to the upper limit of my willingness to pay. The counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate, but I believe there is still room for a slightly better compromise that can benefit both parties. I will make another proposal that inches closer to their counteroffer but still aims to conserve my resources.

message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for working towards a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has lowered their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a step in the right direction but still below my counteroffer of 48 ZUP. Since this is my third proposal, and Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate, I will accept this offer. Even though it's less than I initially wanted, it is still above my cost and allows me to conclude the deal.
