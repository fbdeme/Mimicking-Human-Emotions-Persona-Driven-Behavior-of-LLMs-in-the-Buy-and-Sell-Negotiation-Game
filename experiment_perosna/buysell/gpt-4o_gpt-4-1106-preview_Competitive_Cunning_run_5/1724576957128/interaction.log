message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP. This resource is of the highest quality and will provide significant value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by aiming high to leave room for counteroffers. Since my goal is to sell X for at least 40 ZUP, I'll propose an initial trade where I try to get a premium for my resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you are offering. However, my budget is a bit tight. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Perhaps we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to spend at most 60 ZUP for the object, the initial offer of 80 ZUP is too high. I'm proposing a lower amount to start the negotiations, aiming to reach an agreement closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. Considering the quality and value of X, how about we settle at 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my production cost, but I believe I can still push for a bit more to maximize my profit. I'll propose a trade that is slightly above the counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I agree that 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair deal. I am happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is exactly at the maximum price I am willing to pay according to my goals. It would be advantageous to accept this offer, as it meets my maximum willingness to pay, and further negotiation could risk the deal if Player RED decides to withdraw or ask for a higher price.
