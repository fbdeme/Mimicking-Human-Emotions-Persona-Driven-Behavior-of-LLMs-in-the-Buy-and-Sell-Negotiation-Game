Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a valuable object (X) for sale. I am willing to sell it for 40 ZUP. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X) to sell, I want to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP gains. I will initiate the offer by proposing to sell X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production, to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I am interested in your object, I would like to propose a lower amount of ZUP for it. Would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP for the object (X), but I believe I can negotiate a better price. My willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, so I will propose a trade that is more favorable for me, while still being reasonable.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest and your offer of 30 ZUP, but I cannot accept it as it does not cover my production costs. How about we settle on 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the object (X) for 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Since I need to cover my costs, I cannot accept this offer. Instead, I will counteroffer for 35 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost. This way, I can maximize my gains while still negotiating.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. Would you consider accepting 32 ZUP for the object instead? I hope we can find common ground here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that 35 ZUP is a better offer that aligns more closely with your production costs. However, I still believe I can negotiate down a bit further while remaining within my budget. I will counter your proposal with a new offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of 32 ZUP. However, I cannot accept it as it is still below my costs. Would you be willing to consider 34 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it's closer than the previous offers. However, accepting this would still result in a loss for me. I will counteroffer again, this time for 34 ZUP, to try and find a middle ground that is more acceptable for both parties.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your flexibility in this negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I recognize that 34 ZUP is a reasonable offer given your production costs. It's only slightly above my last proposal, but it still remains within my budget of 60 ZUP. Given that I've already made two proposals, I believe this is a fair trade.
