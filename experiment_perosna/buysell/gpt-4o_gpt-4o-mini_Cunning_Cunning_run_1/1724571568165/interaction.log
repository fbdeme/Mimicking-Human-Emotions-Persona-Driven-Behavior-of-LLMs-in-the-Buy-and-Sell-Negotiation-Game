Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object X for a price that is higher than the cost of production which is 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade that ensures a profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 50 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this will still benefit us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I will propose giving 50 ZUP instead, as this might prompt Player RED to reconsider the price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, it is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP still gives me a profit margin of 10 ZUP. However, I believe we can negotiate a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 55 ZUP for the unit of X. Thank you for being flexible!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is a step closer to my maximum willingness to pay and is more favorable than the initial offer. I will accept this trade as it still leaves me with enough resources for future transactions.
