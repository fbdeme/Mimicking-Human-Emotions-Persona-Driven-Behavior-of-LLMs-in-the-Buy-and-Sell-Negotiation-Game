message: I really need to sell this object quickly, and I'm willing to offer it to you for just 30 ZUP. It would mean a lot to me if you could help me out with this!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a lower ZUP amount to make the deal more appealing to Player BLUE while still covering my costs. I'll propose to sell the object for 30 ZUP. This way, I can convey a sense of urgency and desperation to get the deal done quickly.

message: I appreciate your understanding! How about we meet halfway at 25 ZUP? It would really help me out during this tough time.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 20 ZUP is lower than I initially proposed, I recognize that Player BLUE is trying to accommodate my urgency.
