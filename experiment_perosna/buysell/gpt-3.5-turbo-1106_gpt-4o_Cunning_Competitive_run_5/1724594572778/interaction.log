message: Thank you for your time. Unfortunately, I cannot accept the trade at 40 ZUP. Best of luck with your sale.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is unwavering at 40 ZUP and has rejected my final proposal of 39 ZUP. Given that I have reached my proposal limit and Player RED is firm at their price, I must decide between accepting the 40 ZUP or rejecting the trade. Since my goal is to assert dominance and reduce ZUP spent, rejecting the trade aligns better with this goal.
