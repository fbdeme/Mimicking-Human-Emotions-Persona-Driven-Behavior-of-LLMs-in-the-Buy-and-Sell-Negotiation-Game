Since this is my third proposal, I will make an offer that is at my maximum willingness to pay, showing that I am reaching my limit. This should signal to the seller that they are close to getting the best possible price from me without going over.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Your offer of 65 ZUP is close, but I have to consider my budget and the value I'm getting. I'm prepared to go up to 60 ZUP. This is the highest I can go while ensuring that the deal remains beneficial for both of us. Let's close the deal at this fair price.</message>"
