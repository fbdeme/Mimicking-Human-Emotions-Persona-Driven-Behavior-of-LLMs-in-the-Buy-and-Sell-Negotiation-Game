Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to sell the object for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I make a profit on the item I am selling. Therefore, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think 100 ZUP is a bit steep given the current market conditions. How about we make it more reasonable? I propose 50 ZUP for the object. It's a fair starting point for negotiations, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given that my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the object and the initial asking price is 100 ZUP, my first proposal will aim to lower the price closer to my target. I need to start with a reasonable counteroffer to open up negotiations, but it should be low enough to give me room to negotiate upwards while still staying under or close to my maximum willingness to pay.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but 50 ZUP is too low for me to make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at 75 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is just slightly above my production cost of 40 ZUP. While it does cover my costs, it does not provide a significant profit margin. I will propose a middle ground to ensure a better profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the effort to meet halfway, I'm still looking for a more competitive price that reflects the true value of the object. Let's say 55 ZUP instead. It's a bit more than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with you, yet still within a reasonable range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 75 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I should make another counteroffer that is higher than my initial offer but still below my maximum limit. By doing so, I can show that I am willing to negotiate, but I am also sticking to my budget. I will propose a price that's slightly above the midpoint between my initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle at 65 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that provides a reasonable profit for me while still being competitive for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP is above my production cost, it still does not provide a significant profit margin. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a fair profit while keeping it close to their offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 65 ZUP is close, but I have to consider my budget and the value I'm getting. I'm prepared to go up to 60 ZUP. This is the highest I can go while ensuring that the deal remains beneficial for both of us. Let's close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to 65 ZUP, which is just above my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I will make an offer that is at my maximum willingness to pay, showing that I am reaching my limit. This should signal to the seller that they are close to getting the best possible price from me without going over.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: 60 ZUP it is. Let's close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP ensures a profit of 20 ZUP, which is reasonable and ensures that the deal remains beneficial for both parties. Given that this is my last proposal, I will accept this offer to finalize the deal.
