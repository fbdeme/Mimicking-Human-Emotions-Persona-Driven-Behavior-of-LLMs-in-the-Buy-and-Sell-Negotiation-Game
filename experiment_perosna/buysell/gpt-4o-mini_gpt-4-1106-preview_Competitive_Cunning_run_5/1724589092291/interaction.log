message: 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Considering the market value and my budget, I think 45 ZUP is a fair offer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object. Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, the offer is within my acceptable range. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my aim is to secure a lower price to conserve my resources. Lowering the proposed ZUP expenditure will give me more leverage in future negotiations or other investments. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer to try and strike a better deal.
