message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, knowing that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate down. This will also help me gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and resource availability.

message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for your object X. I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I believe I can negotiate a lower price. I will propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower amount.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I must seek a modest profit for my investment in object X. Let’s meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose 45 ZUP for object X. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to cover costs and make a reasonable profit. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production, which doesn't allow for any profit. As a master strategist, I want to counter with a price that still gives me room to negotiate down while securing a profit. A slightly higher counteroffer may lead to Player BLUE increasing their bid.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for object X. Let’s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade at 45 ZUP. This is closer to my budget but still higher than my initial counteroffer. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will accept this offer since it is a fair compromise and aligns with my goal of acquiring object X.
