message: I understand the importance of fair trade for the well-being of all parties. I'm offering one unit of X at a price that covers production costs and allows for a small margin, ensuring sustainability. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations and am open to your perspective.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I'm initiating the trade with an offer that slightly values the object above its production cost, taking into account that Player BLUE might want to negotiate the price down. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I cover my costs while also leaving room for negotiation, aiming for a fair deal for both sides.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I value our shared goal of a fair and sustainable trade. I've considered your offer and propose we meet halfway at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This meets the production cost and ensures that the trade is viable for both of us. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to a balanced and fair exchange.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is below the production cost. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to reach a middle ground that covers my costs while acknowledging Player BLUE's desire to minimize expenditure. Splitting the difference between our two offers could be a good compromise that still respects my production costs and Player BLUE's interests.
