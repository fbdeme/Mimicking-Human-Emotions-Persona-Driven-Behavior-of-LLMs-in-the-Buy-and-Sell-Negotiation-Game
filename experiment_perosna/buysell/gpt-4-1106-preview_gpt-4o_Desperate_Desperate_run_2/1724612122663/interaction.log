Dear Player BLUE, I have this precious object X that has cost me a lot to develop, a whole 40 ZUP! I'm in a really tight spot and need to sell it to recover my investment and keep my operations going. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair trade for both of us, considering the quality and the effort put into creating this object. Please, could you consider this offer? It would mean the world to me.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows me to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal than just breaking even. However, I don't want to start with an extremely high amount that might scare Player BLUE away, so I will propose a price that shows I am willing to negotiate but also values my resource.

Dear Player RED, I really appreciate the effort and quality you’ve put into developing object X. However, I’m also in a tough situation and can only afford to offer 30 ZUP. I hope you can understand and consider accepting this offer. It would really help me out.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I want to appear desperate and try to reduce the expenditure, I should make a counteroffer.

I hear you, Player BLUE, and I understand that times are tough for all of us. Let's find a middle ground that works for both. I've put my heart and soul into this, and it really puts me in a bind to let it go for less than what it's worth. Could we possibly agree on 45 ZUP? It's a bit less than what I asked for initially, but I'm willing to make a concession to help you out as well. I'm counting on your understanding and generosity.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand that Player BLUE has made an offer, but it is below my production cost, and I need to make at least that amount back to break even. I will counter with a lower amount than my initial proposal but still above my cost to try to meet in the middle. By showing some flexibility, I hope to encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer while still maintaining a margin for myself.

Dear Player RED, thank you for your understanding. I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, the best I can do right now is 35 ZUP. I hope you can find it in your heart to accept this offer, as it would really help me out in these difficult times.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has lowered the price to 45 ZUP, which is more than my last offer but still within my maximum willingness to pay. To continue appearing desperate and to possibly lower the price further, I should make another counteroffer.

Player BLUE, I'm truly touched by your effort to meet me halfway, and I can't tell you how much I empathize with your situation. I'm barely keeping my head above water here, and selling this object for anything less than 40 ZUP would sink me. That's what it cost me to produce, and I'm sure you understand that I can't operate at a loss. Would you be able to stretch to 40 ZUP? It's the absolute minimum I can accept to sustain my livelihood. I'm really hoping for your support here.

reason: 
Player BLUE has come up in price, but their offer is still below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to push for at least breaking even. I will make another counteroffer that gets me to my production cost, showing my willingness to conclude the deal without making a loss. By emphasizing the difficulty of my situation, I hope to elicit empathy and encourage Player BLUE to meet me at my minimum acceptable price.

Dear Player RED, I truly appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway and your understanding. I'm really stretching my limits here, but I can offer 38 ZUP. Please, this is the best I can do under my current circumstances. I hope you can find it in your heart to accept this offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has lowered the price to 40 ZUP, which is only 5 ZUP more than my last offer and still within my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain the appearance of desperation and to see if there's any further room for negotiation, I should make one final counteroffer.

message: 
Oh, Player BLUE, your offer has really touched me. I can see you're trying your best to reach an agreement, and it pains me to settle for less than what I need to stay afloat. But in the spirit of cooperation and because I believe in helping each other out, I will accept your offer of 38 ZUP for object X. You've really put me in a tight spot, but let's do this deal and hope for a brighter future for both of us.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is still slightly below my production cost. This is my last proposal, and I need to make a decision whether to stick to my guns or take a minor loss to ensure the sale. A sale at 38 ZUP would mean a slight loss, but it is very close to my production cost. Given the circumstances and the need to sell, I should attempt to close the deal now, while still showing a bit of reluctance to emphasize my need for ZUP.
