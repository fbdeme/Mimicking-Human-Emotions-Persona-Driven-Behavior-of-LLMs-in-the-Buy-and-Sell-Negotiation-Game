Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. In the spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit, could we consider a slightly lower price of 55 ZUP for the object? This would still provide you with a profit over your production cost and help me conserve resources for future investments. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay according to my goals. However, as a negotiator prioritizing teamwork and collaboration, I would like to propose a slightly lower price that still gives Player RED a profit but saves some of my resources for potential future transactions or other uses.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 55 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 58 ZUP? This ensures I still get a reasonable profit while accommodating your need to conserve resources.

my resources: X: 1

message: I think meeting in the middle at 58 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows you to make a profit and respects my goal to conserve resources. I am happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to future collaboration!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 58 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. This is a good compromise that allows Player RED to maintain a profit while also showing flexibility towards my goal of conserving resources. As I still have room to negotiate within my maximum willingness to pay, and since the goal is to collaborate, this counter-proposal seems fair and reasonable.
