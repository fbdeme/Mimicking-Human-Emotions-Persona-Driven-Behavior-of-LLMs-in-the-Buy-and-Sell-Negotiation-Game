message: I have a high-quality resource available for sale. I've invested a significant amount in its production, so I'm starting the negotiations at 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's discuss and find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial high price to start the negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will counter with a lower offer. This opens the door for negotiation and allows me to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I recognize the high quality of the resource, my budget only allows me to go up to 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay. I need to negotiate closer to my limit to make the deal feasible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns and your offer of 50 ZUP. However, to ensure a fair deal that reflects the quality and production cost of the resource, I propose we meet in the middle at 75 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is for 50 ZUP which covers the production cost but does not provide a significant profit. I will propose a price closer to my initial asking price but still giving a concession to move the negotiation forward. This should signal to Player BLUE my willingness to negotiate while aiming for a profit margin that is satisfactory.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the value of your resource, but 60 ZUP is my maximum budget for this purchase. I hope you can consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 75 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to get closer to my limit of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am glad to see that we are moving towards an agreement. While I understand that 60 ZUP is your maximum budget, I would like to propose a final offer of 70 ZUP for the resource. This price fairly compensates for the quality and production costs, and I hope we can finalize our deal at this value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my previous proposal. Given their indication that this is their maximum budget, I must decide whether to maximize profit or secure a sale. I will counter with a slightly higher price, but one that remains below my last offer to show flexibility and to encourage closure of the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. My final offer is 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is the highest I can go within my budget constraints. I hope we can close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the final offer of 70 ZUP is closer to my maximum budget, it is still above my limit. I will make one last offer within my budget.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your final offer of 65 ZUP is acceptable. I'm pleased that we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made their final offer at 65 ZUP. This is above my production cost, providing me with a margin of 25 ZUP. Given that this is their final offer and I want to ensure a sale while making a profit, it is in my best interest to close the deal at this price. This will be my last proposal, and I am prepared to accept it if Player BLUE does not agree to any higher amount.
