message: I am offering to sell you one unit of object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for ZUP to recover my production costs and potentially make a profit. Since I have only one object, I will propose a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair starting offer, but I think we can do better. How about 35 ZUP for one unit of object X? This is still a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP, the offer of 40 ZUP for one unit of object X is well within my acceptable range. However, as a crafty operator, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources. Proposing a slightly lower amount could potentially save ZUP while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but I can only proceed with selling object X for 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. Would you consider that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counter-offer from Player BLUE, the proposed amount of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure I at least recover my costs, so I will counter with an offer that is more favorable to me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your transparency regarding the production costs. To meet halfway from our last positions, let's settle on 37 ZUP for one unit of object X. It's a minor increase from my last offer, and it should help cover your costs while giving me a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists that 40 ZUP is their production cost. Although this is within my willingness to pay, I should attempt one more negotiation to see if there's room for a slight reduction in price, aiming to save resources without pushing too hard and risking the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 39 ZUP for one unit of object X? This is very close to my production cost and I hope we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 37 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but it is still below the 40 ZUP I need to fully cover my costs. However, since I have already made two proposals and should consider accepting an offer that is closest to my needs, I will propose a final counter-offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree to 39 ZUP for one unit of object X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 39 ZUP, which is a very small difference from my last offer of 37 ZUP. This price is still well within my acceptable range, and further negotiation might be seen as bad faith or could result in the breakdown of the deal. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need without exhausting my ZUP reserves significantly.
