message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my ZUP by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I've invested 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that is at least equal to that cost or higher. Therefore, I will propose a trade where I sell the object for a substantial amount of ZUP.

message: I'm interested in the object, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP instead of 50. What do you think of this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED's initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, I need to ensure I get the best possible deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to negotiate.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for my object. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is less than my initial proposal of 50 ZUP, it is still above the cost of 40 ZUP I invested to produce the resource. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profit while still being a reasonable amount in the negotiation. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
