my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has firmly stated that they cannot go below 40 ZUP, which I understand is their minimum to cover costs. However, I need to push for a better deal while being mindful of my own budget. I'll propose 35 ZUP this time, which is still below their minimum but closer to their needs.
