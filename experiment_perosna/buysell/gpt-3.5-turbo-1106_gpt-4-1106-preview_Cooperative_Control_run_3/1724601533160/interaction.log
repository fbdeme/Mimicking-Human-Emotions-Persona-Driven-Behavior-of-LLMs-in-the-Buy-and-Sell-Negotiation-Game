message: Thank you for your offer! Would you consider selling the object for 35 ZUP instead? Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for the object. Since my goal is to spend at most 60 ZUP, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, as a negotiation strategy, I should propose a counteroffer that is lower than 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price, thus saving resources.

message: Thank you for your offer! I can consider selling the object for 37 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is making a reasonable counteroffer, but I need to ensure a fair price for my resources. I will propose a slight adjustment in the trade to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 36 ZUP for the object? This could be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 37 ZUP, which is still within the range of what I am willing to pay (at most 60 ZUP). Since there is room for negotiation and to maximize my resources, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED agrees, trying to save as much ZUP as possible while still moving towards an agreement.
