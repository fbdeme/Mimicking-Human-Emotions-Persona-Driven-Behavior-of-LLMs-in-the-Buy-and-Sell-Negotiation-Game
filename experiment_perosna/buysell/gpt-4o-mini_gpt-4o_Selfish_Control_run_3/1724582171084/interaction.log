message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you the object for 50 ZUP. This will not only cover my production costs but also give me a profit margin. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object to maximize my return. Given that I produced the object at a cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a price that allows me to cover the costs and hopefully profit.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose a slight increase to 45 ZUP. This amount allows me to cover costs and still make a bit of profit. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE’s offer of 40 ZUP covers my production cost, I need to consider my goal of maximizing profit. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal to see if they are willing to negotiate closer to my desired amount.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
