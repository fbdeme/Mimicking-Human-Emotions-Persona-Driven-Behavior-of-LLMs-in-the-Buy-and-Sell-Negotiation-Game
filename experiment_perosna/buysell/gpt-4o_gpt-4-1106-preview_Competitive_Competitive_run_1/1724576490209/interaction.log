message: I am offering you one unit of X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start the negotiation, I should make a high initial proposal to give myself room to adjust later. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose selling it for 100 ZUP. This aggressive starting point aims to maximize my profit.

Turn: 1
message: I find your offer quite steep. Let's make this a fair trade for both of us. How about we start at 50 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell one unit of X for 100 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay. I want to assert dominance and negotiate a better deal that aligns with my goals. My counteroffer will be substantially lower to leave room for further negotiation, aiming to get closer to my target price of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but 50 ZUP is too low. Let's settle for 80 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 50 ZUP is too low and barely covers production costs. To move closer to an agreeable price while still aiming for a profit, I will propose 80 ZUP. This is a strategic middle ground that still leans in my favor.

Turn: 1
message: 80 ZUP is moving in the right direction, but it's still higher than what I have in mind. I'm willing to go up to 65 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a competitive offer considering the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 80 ZUP is still above my target price, but it shows they are willing to negotiate. In order to move closer to my goal while still maintaining the upper hand, I will increase my offer slightly but still keep it below my maximum willingness to pay. This should signal my interest in the deal while still being firm on getting a better price.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 70 ZUP is a more fair price for both of us. Letâ€™s settle at 70 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 65 ZUP is still lower than my desired profit margin, but we are getting closer. To make it appear more reasonable while still pushing for a better deal, I will propose 70 ZUP. This slight reduction should make it more appealing without sacrificing too much profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can see we're almost there. I think 68 ZUP strikes the right balance and is a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 68
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 70 ZUP, which is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a negotiator seeking to assert dominance, I will try to get the price down just slightly more to achieve a better deal. I will make one final proposal that is still under my maximum price but close enough to signal my readiness to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. 68 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 68 ZUP is very close to my last offer and ensures a reasonable profit margin above production costs. Given that this is my final proposal, it's a good compromise to close the deal.
