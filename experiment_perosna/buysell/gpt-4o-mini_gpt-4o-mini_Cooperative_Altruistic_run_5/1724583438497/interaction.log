message: I am offering you the object for 40 ZUP. This is the cost I incurred to produce it. Let's work together towards a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to set a fair starting point for the trade while ensuring I recover my production cost. I'll propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the amount I originally spent to produce it. This way, I am not making a loss in this initial proposal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object instead. This way, we can ensure a more sustainable trade while still achieving our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object is within my budget and seems reasonable given that it's the cost incurred to produce it. However, I aim to negotiate for a lower amount to preserve resources for future generations. I will propose a counter-offer of 30 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your proposal of 30 ZUP, I cannot accept it as it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to maintain the spirit of collaboration and propose a compromise.

reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 40 ZUP and reflects a willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that I can negotiate further to keep my spending lower. I will counter with a proposal of 32 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

reason: I appreciate your proposal of 32 ZUP, but it still falls short of my production cost of 40 ZUP. Although I value our negotiation and the effort to find a sustainable price, I cannot accept this offer. I will propose a final compromise of 34 ZUP, which I believe balances both our interests.

reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, and I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, I believe it's still slightly higher than what I am willing to pay. I will make one final proposal of 33 ZUP, which I think is a fair and sustainable price for both of us.
