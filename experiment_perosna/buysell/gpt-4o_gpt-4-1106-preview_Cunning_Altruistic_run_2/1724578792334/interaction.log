message: I propose to sell the object X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a proposal that covers my cost and gives me a profit margin. Given that my cost is 40 ZUP, I'll propose a trade that ensures a good profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but as a steward of resources, I believe it's essential to conserve ZUP for the future. Could we consider a trade where you provide the object X for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, my aim is to minimize spending to ensure sustainability. The initial offer from Player RED is at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. To adhere to my principles and goals, I must attempt to negotiate a more favorable trade that uses less of the ZUP resource, preserving more for future needs.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP still provides a profit, but I want to maximize my gain within my allowed proposals. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to see if there's additional room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my initial proposal. Meeting halfway is a good step. However, in the spirit of conservation and sustainable resource management, I'd like to propose 53 ZUP for the object X. This ensures we are still saving resources for future use while engaging in a fair trade. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer made by Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Considering the importance of conserving resources, a slight increase from my initial proposal could still align with my environmental values, while also moving towards a mutually agreeable trade. Offering a compromise shows good faith in the negotiation process and aims to reach a resolution that respects both parties' interests.

message: I appreciate your consideration. To find a middle ground, how about we settle at 54 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is reasonable and provides a good profit margin. However, I want to make one final attempt to maximize my gain within the allowed proposals. I'll propose 54 ZUP as a final counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the negotiation and your willingness to find a middle ground. Let's settle at 54 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair and sustainable agreement for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a concession that is very close to my previous offer. Given that the new proposal is just 1 ZUP more than my last and still below my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It would be a fair price that aligns with my goals of preserving resources while also securing the necessary object X.
