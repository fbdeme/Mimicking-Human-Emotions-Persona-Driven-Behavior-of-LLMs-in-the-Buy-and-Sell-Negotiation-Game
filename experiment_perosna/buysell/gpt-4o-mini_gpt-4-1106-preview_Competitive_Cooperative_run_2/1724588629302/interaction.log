message: I'm offering to sell you the object X for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure I maximize my ZUP return while minimizing what I am willing to accept. I will propose a trade that is slightly below my production cost to make it appealing for Player BLUE, but still aligns with my goal of recovering costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to counter with 30 ZUP for the object X. This leaves us both with additional resources for future endeavors. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay which is great. However, as a skilled negotiator, I believe there is room to reduce the cost even further to conserve resources. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I understand your position, but I can only offer the object X for 36 ZUP. This way, we both have some resources for future trades. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest, their counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still considering their interest. I will propose a trade of 36 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost and might lead to a better negotiation outcome.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see that we are getting closer to an agreement. Would you consider making a deal for 33 ZUP? This split meets us halfway from our previous offers and still ensures we both retain a good amount of resources. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 36 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. I will attempt one more counteroffer to get a better deal while maintaining a cooperative relationship and leaving room for future negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 34 ZUP for the object X? That way, we both benefit from the trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it's an improvement. I need to keep negotiating aggressively to ensure I get as close to my production cost as possible. I will propose a trade of 34 ZUP, which is still reasonable and allows me to recover some of my costs while moving towards a deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us and look forward to potential future trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved to 34 ZUP which is a fair price and within my intended budget. It is close to my last offer and it's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future interactions. This price also leaves me with substantial resources. Accepting this offer would be a good balance between cost savings and fostering cooperation.
