my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 20 ZUP for the object is acceptable to me, and I appreciate the fair trade. Let's proceed with this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, and the current offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, I find this initial offer acceptable. It benefits my objectives and leaves me with substantial ZUP for future transactions or other uses, which aligns with the selfless negotiator role by preserving resources for the greater good.
