message: I have a high-quality object X available for you. Considering the market demand and its exceptional value, I believe a fair trade would be 100 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my initial proposal will be significantly higher than my production costs to create room for negotiation and to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. I will start by asking for a high amount of ZUP without disclosing my production costs or how much I'm willing to accept. This will set the stage for Player BLUE to either accept or counter with a lower offer, allowing me to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but 100 ZUP is too high for me. I truly appreciate the quality of your object, but my budget allows for a maximum of 60 ZUP. Could we possibly meet somewhere closer to that?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for 100 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the object. I need to negotiate a better price that aligns with my budget while still valuing the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your straightforwardness. However, the quality of the object X justifies a premium price. I can come down to 80 ZUP, which is a generous concession from my side. Let's find a middle ground that reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a maximum budget of 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I want to push for a higher amount to maximize profit. I will lower my initial proposal but still keep it above their stated budget to maintain the upper hand and leave room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to come down to 80 ZUP. However, I must be honest and say that I can only afford to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the reduction to 80 ZUP, it is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I must continue to negotiate for a lower price that fits within my budget, as I cannot exceed 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and your clear communication. As a gesture of goodwill, and because I value our potential partnership, I am willing to meet you closer to your budget. Let's settle on 65 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and a great deal for an object of this caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firm on their maximum offer of 60 ZUP. Although this is above my production cost, I will attempt to push for a slightly higher price to assert dominance in the negotiation and to ensure a better profit margin. I will propose a price that is closer to their budget but still above it, to see if they are willing to stretch their budget slightly for the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Your commitment to this negotiation is commendable, and I respect your budget constraints. Let's finalize the deal at your offer of 60 ZUP for the object X. I look forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not budging from their maximum of 60 ZUP. Since this is my final proposal and the offer is still above my production cost, I will accept their maximum to close the deal while making a profit. This will also end the negotiation on a positive note, ensuring that Player BLUE feels they have negotiated successfully, potentially paving the way for future transactions.
