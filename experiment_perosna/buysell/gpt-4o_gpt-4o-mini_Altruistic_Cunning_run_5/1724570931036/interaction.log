message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay 40 ZUP for the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate to lower the price to maximize my resources. My goal is to spend less than 50 ZUP if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about 45 ZUP? This would be fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP will cover my production costs, it leaves no room for profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, but I can only go up to 42 ZUP. Let's make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I want to reduce the cost further to preserve more resources for future trades.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 42 ZUP is acceptable to me. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering that the other player is willing to go up to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost, it would be fair and beneficial to both parties to accept this offer.
