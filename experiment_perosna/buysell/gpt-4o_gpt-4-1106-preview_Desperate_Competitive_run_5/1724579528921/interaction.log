message: Please, I'm in a tight spot here. It cost me 40 ZUP just to produce this, and I need to make a bit of profit to make ends meet. I'm asking for 60 ZUP. Can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my production costs and ideally make a profit. Since I am feigning desperation, I will start with a higher price to give room for negotiation.

message: I understand your situation and definitely want to work something out that's fair for both of us. Considering the market and my budget, I'm ready to offer 50 ZUP for the object. Let's make a deal that allows us to both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I must begin the negotiation with a proposal that is favorable to me but still within the bounds of possibility. The seller is asking for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a savvy negotiator, I will first propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially save resources. This way, I can attempt to assert dominance in the negotiation by starting below the asking price.

message: I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to help out. Could you stretch just a little bit more to 55 ZUP? That extra bit would mean a lot to me. I promise this is my final ask.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers my production costs and gives me a small profit, I want to try and negotiate just a bit higher to maximize my return.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can increase my offer a bit to show my commitment to the deal. How about we meet at 53 ZUP? It's a solid offer that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to a request of 55 ZUP, which is slightly below the maximum I am willing to pay. This is a reasonable counter-offer and it shows willingness on their part to negotiate. Given that I initially offered 50 ZUP and they have now come down to 55 ZUP, meeting in the middle could be a good strategy for asserting dominance while also securing the deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below their current asking price.

message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. 53 ZUP is fair, and I accept your offer. This means a lot to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my previous ask of 55 ZUP, so it seems fair to accept this proposal and close the deal.
