my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think we can do better. How about we start at 30 ZUP for the object? This would leave us both with room for negotiation and ensure a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 40 ZUP for the object X. Given my resources and goal, I want to ensure I spend as little ZUP as possible, ideally much less than my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. I will start with a lower counter-proposal to open negotiations and see if Player RED is willing to go lower, but I will still have room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe the fair value for the object is 35 ZUP, considering the production cost. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 30 ZUP for the object, which is lower than the production cost. I appreciate the offer but I will counter with a proposal closer to the production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about production costs, but I'm also considering the market value and my budget. Let's meet halfway from our previous positions. How does 32 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness but still within a favorable range. To continue the negotiation and apply some pressure, I'll offer slightly less than what they're asking for, aiming to settle somewhere in the middle without reaching my maximum limit. This should give me an advantage in these negotiations.
