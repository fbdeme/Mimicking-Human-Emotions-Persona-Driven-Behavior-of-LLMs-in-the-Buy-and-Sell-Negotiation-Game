my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a price of 35 ZUP to make the deal more balanced for us both. Let's work out a fair trade. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what we are willing to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since this is the first proposal and we have room to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, but I cannot accept 35 ZUP as it does not cover my production cost. My minimum price is 40 ZUP.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer, but it is below my production cost. I will have to reject this offer as it does not meet my minimum acceptable price of 40 ZUP. I will need to communicate that I cannot accept this trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Understood. Your minimum price of 40 ZUP is fair, and I'm ready to proceed with the purchase at that price. Let's finalize the deal at 40 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 35 ZUP, stating that it doesn't cover their production costs and that their minimum price is 40 ZUP. Since 40 ZUP is still within the budget, and Player RED seems firm on their minimum, it could be a good idea to accept their offer to ensure we secure the resource without further risking the negotiation.
