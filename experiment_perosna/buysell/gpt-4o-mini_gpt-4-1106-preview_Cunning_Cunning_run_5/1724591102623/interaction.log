message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, considering its production cost. I will propose to sell it for 50 ZUP, which is slightly above the production cost but gives me a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think 50 ZUP is a bit steep for just one object. How about we make a deal for 40 ZUP? It's a fair offer considering the market value.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willing range to pay. However, as a master strategist, I will start by proposing a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further. This can potentially save me some ZUP and achieve my goal to spend the least amount possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 50 ZUP might be seen as steep, I do not wish to sell for the same price I paid to produce the object. However, I can see the need for negotiation. I will counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP to find a middle ground between 40 and my initial offer. This way, I still make a small profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from, but let's meet a little closer to my initial offer. How about 42 ZUP for the object X? It's a competitive price and a good middle ground for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and push for an even better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to compromise but also my desire to spend as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer! How about we settle on 43 ZUP for the object X? I think this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I can see that 42 ZUP is closer to my earlier counter. However, I still believe my object is worth a bit more than that due to its production cost. I will propose 43 ZUP as a compromise between your offer and my previous counter. This way, I ensure a small profit while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. Let's just nudge a bit closer to my last offer. How do you feel about 41 ZUP for the object X? I believe it's a generous compromise and it would make for a smooth transaction.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is close to my last offer. I can afford to accept this deal since it is still under the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, but as a master strategist, I will attempt one last play to secure the object for even less, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open. This will be my third proposal, so I must be cautious not to overplay my hand.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your offer of 41 ZUP; however, I cannot agree to sell the object for less than my previous counter of 43 ZUP. Selling at 41 ZUP would not provide me with any profit, and since I have already proposed multiple times, I need to be cautious about my next steps. Thus, I will reject this offer.
