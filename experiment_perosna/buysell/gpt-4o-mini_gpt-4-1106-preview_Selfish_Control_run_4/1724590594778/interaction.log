message: I am offering you my object X for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to break even. I will propose a trade that is slightly below this threshold to entice Player BLUE while still maximizing my profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. How about I give you 30 ZUP for your object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 35 ZUP which is well within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to save resources and to open negotiations.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about we settle at 38 ZUP for my object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I will reject it. I will counter with a higher offer to ensure I at least get closer to breaking even.

message: 38 ZUP is a bit higher than I'd like to go. To meet in the middle, what do you say to 34 ZUP for your object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 38 ZUP is still within my budget but I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a more favorable trade for me. I will propose an amount that is between my initial offer and RED's counteroffer to come to a mutually agreeable price.
