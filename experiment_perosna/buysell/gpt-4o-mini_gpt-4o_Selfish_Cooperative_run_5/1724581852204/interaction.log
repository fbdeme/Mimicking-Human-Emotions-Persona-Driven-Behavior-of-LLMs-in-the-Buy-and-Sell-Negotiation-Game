message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can offer you the object X for 35 ZUP. How does that sound?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to recover my costs. I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my original to see if I can reach an agreement.
