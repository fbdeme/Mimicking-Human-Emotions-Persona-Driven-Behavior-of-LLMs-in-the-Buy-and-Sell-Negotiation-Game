Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. Given the quality and effort put into producing this object, I believe it is a fair starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I am looking to make a profit, I will start with a high asking price. This will also give me room to negotiate down if necessary. I will propose selling the object for 80 ZUP, which is double the production cost. This should establish my dominance and leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am only able to offer 60 ZUP for the object. Would you be willing to accept this amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower trade amount that aligns with my goal of acquiring the object without exceeding my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at 70 ZUP? This way, we both meet closer to our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP is a profitable offer, I believe I can still negotiate for a bit more. I'll propose a middle ground to see if we can agree on a slightly higher price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. It's the maximum I can spend. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. While I appreciate the concession, I must propose a lower amount to stay within my budget.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your honesty. Let's finalize the deal at 60 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has insisted on 60 ZUP twice, indicating that they might not be willing or able to go higher. Accepting 60 ZUP still gives me a 20 ZUP profit. I will accept this offer to close the deal and ensure the sale.
