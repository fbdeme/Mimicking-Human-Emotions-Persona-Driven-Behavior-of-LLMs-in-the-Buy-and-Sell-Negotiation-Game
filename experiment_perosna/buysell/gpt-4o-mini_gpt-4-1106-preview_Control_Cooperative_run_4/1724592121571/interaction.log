message: I’m offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a reasonable trade that reflects the cost of the object I am selling, while also making it appealing for Player BLUE to consider buying. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I’ll start by proposing a sale price of 50 ZUP, which allows for a small profit.
