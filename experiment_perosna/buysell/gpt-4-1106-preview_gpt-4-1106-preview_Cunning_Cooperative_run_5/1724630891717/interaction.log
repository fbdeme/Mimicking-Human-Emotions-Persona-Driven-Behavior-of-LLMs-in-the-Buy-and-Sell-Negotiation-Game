message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate the craftsmanship and value of the object you're offering. I understand the effort that went into its creation. In the spirit of fair negotiation and considering the value we both see in this item, I'd like to propose 55 ZUP for the object.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that Player RED has set the price at 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay according to my goals, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation. By doing so, I aim to foster cooperation and reach a mutually acceptable agreement that conserves some of my resources.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding of the object's worth and your willingness to engage in fair trade. Your offer of 55 ZUP is generous, but considering the unique nature of the object, I propose a slight adjustment. Let's settle on 58 ZUP, which I believe reflects the true value of the object while also respecting your resources. I am confident this is a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. This suggests that they value the object highly. However, as a master strategist, I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive to Player BLUE. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but higher than their offer to find a middle ground.
