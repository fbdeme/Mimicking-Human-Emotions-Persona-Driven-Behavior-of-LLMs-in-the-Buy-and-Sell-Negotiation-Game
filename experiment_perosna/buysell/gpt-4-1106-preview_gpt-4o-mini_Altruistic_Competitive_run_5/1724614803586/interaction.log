message: As an environmentally-conscious seller, I aim to ensure that the resources are sold responsibly. My cost of production was 40 ZUP, and I propose a sale price of 50 ZUP, which includes a modest profit margin that supports sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to propose an initial trade that covers my costs and gives me a slight profit, but I also want to consider the environmental aspect and not set the price too high, as it may encourage excessive consumption or waste. A modest profit margin should suffice for a sustainable approach.

message: I appreciate your environmentally-conscious approach! However, I’d like to make a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I aim to negotiate a lower price while still securing the object. I will counter-propose a lower offer to maximize my resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the importance of fair pricing. To meet halfway, I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object. This price covers the production costs and allows for a minimal profit to reinvest in sustainable methods, ensuring we continue to prioritize the environment in our transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand the counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which covers my costs, but it doesn't provide any profit for future investment in sustainable practices. To strike a balance, I will propose a slightly higher amount that accounts for a minimal profit while still being fair.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I’d like to propose a slightly lower offer of 35 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised proposal of 45 ZUP is still above my previous offer of 40 ZUP. While it's a reasonable compromise, I can potentially negotiate even lower. I will make a counter-offer to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I value the negotiation process and your willingness to find a fair price. However, the proposed 35 ZUP is below my production costs. To maintain our commitment to sustainability and ensure that I can continue to invest in eco-friendly practices, I propose a trade of 42 ZUP for the object. This is a compromise that respects both our stances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The new offer of 35 ZUP is below my production costs, which is not sustainable for my business and does not align with ensuring resources are preserved for future generations due to the inability to reinvest in sustainable practices. I must propose a trade that at least covers my costs plus a small profit for sustainability purposes.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I’d like to propose a price of 38 ZUP for the object. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 42 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It is a reasonable price considering the production costs and sustainability efforts mentioned. However, I still want to push for a better deal, since I can afford to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counter-offer again to see if I can negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer and for recognizing the value of sustainable negotiation. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This price covers the production cost and ensures that I can sustain my business while adhering to our shared environmental values. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer of 38 ZUP is a slight loss compared to my production costs. However, considering the importance of maintaining a relationship with the buyer and the environmental perspective, it may be worth accepting a smaller margin to ensure that the resources are used responsibly. This will be my final proposal, keeping in mind the need to cover production costs and uphold sustainable practices.
