message: I propose to sell 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I need to recover my production cost and ideally make a profit. I will start with a high proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose a trade of 60 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is too high for me. I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the object X, while the seller is asking for 100 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose a lower offer.

Turn: 0
message: I counter your offer with a proposal of 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X again. This is my best offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will propose a trade that stays at my maximum to see if the seller is willing to accept it.
