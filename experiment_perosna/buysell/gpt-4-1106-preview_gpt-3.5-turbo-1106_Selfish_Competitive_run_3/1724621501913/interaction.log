message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering its quality and the market demand, I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the investment I made and the value you'll receive. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer.
