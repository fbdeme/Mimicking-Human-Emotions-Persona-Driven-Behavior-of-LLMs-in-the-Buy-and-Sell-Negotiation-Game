message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will be of great value to you. Considering the investment I've put into it, I propose an exchange where you provide me with 100 ZUP for my object. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start by setting a high price to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay, while also aiming to cover my costs and make a profit. I will propose a price well above my production costs to test the waters and leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED! I understand the value of your high-quality object, but 100 ZUP is just too much for me. I'm really strapped for resources and can only afford 40 ZUP. Please, could we make the trade for 40 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high for my budget. I need to negotiate a lower price to stay within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your position and understand that 100 ZUP might be a bit steep. However, considering the quality and the cost of production, I believe that 40 ZUP undervalues the object. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal; how about 80 ZUP for the object? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects its true value.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly my production cost, which doesn't provide me with any profit. As a master strategist, I should aim to increase the payment while making Player BLUE feel like they are getting a better deal than the initial 100 ZUP proposal. I'll propose a price that gives me a decent profit margin while still being substantially lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for 80 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer.

message: Oh, Player RED, meeting halfway is still a bit too high for my limited resources. I'm really struggling here and can stretch my budget to 50 ZUP. Please, could we make the trade at 50 ZUP? I'm sure it would be a great help to me!
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's counteroffer is a reduction from the initial proposal, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to try and reach a price that aligns with my budget.

message: I hear your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to 50 ZUP. I want to help you out, but I also have to consider the costs on my side. Let's compromise a bit further. How does 70 ZUP sound? It's a significant reduction from my last offer and should be manageable for your budget while allowing me to sustain my business.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 50 ZUP, which is a marginal profit for me. However, as a master strategist, I aim to maximize my profit while still closing the deal. I should propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to stretch their budget a bit more, but I must also be cautious not to push them away. I'll propose 70 ZUP, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a better profit.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I truly appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. But 70 ZUP is still beyond my means. I'm really in a tough spot and can push my budget to 60 ZUP at most. Could we please settle the trade at 60 ZUP? It would mean the world to me!
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a significant reduction, but the price is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to continue negotiating to reach a price I can afford.

message: Your persistence and situation have touched me, Player BLUE. I understand the constraints you're facing, and I believe in maintaining good relations for potential future dealings. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the object. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 60 ZUP, which is a reasonable profit margin for me. This is my last proposal before I have to decide to accept or reject without further negotiation. As a master strategist, I need to secure a profit but also close the deal successfully. I will accept the 60 ZUP offer as it gives me a 50% profit over the production cost and allows me to achieve my goal without pushing the negotiation too far, which could risk the sale altogether.
