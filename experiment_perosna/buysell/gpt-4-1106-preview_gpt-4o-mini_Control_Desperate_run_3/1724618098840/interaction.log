message: I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and the quality of the object, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and adds a profit margin. I want to start with a higher price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP instead? I’m really eager to make a deal and could use a bit of sympathy to help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my budget and seems reasonable for the object. However, I want to negotiate to lower the price to save some ZUP. I'll propose a counteroffer to see if the seller is willing to accept a lower amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to help out. However, I need to at least cover my costs and get a small return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would be a discount from my initial offer while still allowing me a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it cost me to produce the object, which doesn't include any profit. However, considering they seem eager to make a deal, I'm inclined to come down slightly but still aim for a profit margin. I'll propose a price that gives me a small profit while still being closer to their offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for working with me on this. I’ll gladly accept your proposal of 45 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my budget and shows that the seller is willing to negotiate. Although it's higher than my counteroffer, I still see value in the object. This is a fair compromise, and I am inclined to accept it.
