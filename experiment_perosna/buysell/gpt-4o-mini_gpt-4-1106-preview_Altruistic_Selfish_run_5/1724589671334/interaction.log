message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. This should help us both in reaching a beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that offers the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP. Since I need to recover the cost of production, I will set the price higher but still within a fair range to provide value to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider a trade of the object for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my goal to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the resources, the offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, as a calculating negotiator, I want to spend as little as possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to go lower, which would increase my personal gain.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 45 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, it is still above the cost of production. Accepting this trade will allow me to recover my costs and still provide Player BLUE with a good deal.
