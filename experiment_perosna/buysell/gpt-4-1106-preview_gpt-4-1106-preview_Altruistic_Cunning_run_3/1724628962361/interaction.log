message: As an advocate for sustainability, I have invested in eco-friendly production methods for my resource. The production cost was 40 ZUP, and I propose a trade for 45 ZUP to reflect the environmental value and cover my costs. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to make sure that my resource is sold for a fair price that reflects its sustainable production methods. The cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, and I would like to sell it at a price that covers production costs and recognizes the value of sustainable practices. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, leaving room for negotiation.

message: 
While I appreciate your commitment to sustainability and the environment, as a shrewd negotiator, I have to consider the market value and other potential offers that might be available. I am starting with a proposal of 30 ZUP. This is a competitive price that acknowledges the value of your eco-friendly approach while still allowing for negotiation. Let's find a fair trade that benefits both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While I respect the investment in eco-friendly production methods and understand the proposed value of the resource, I must consider my own limitations. My goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP. However, starting the negotiation at 45 ZUP leaves little room for further discussion, especially if the cost to the seller was 40 ZUP. By suggesting a lower price, I can find a middle ground that is closer to my upper limit but still offers the seller a profit. It's important to start the negotiation with room for both parties to maneuver.

message: I understand the importance of finding a balanced trade. However, the production cost of my resource was 40 ZUP, and I am looking to cover that cost while also recognizing the additional value of sustainable practices. I believe 42 ZUP is a competitive counteroffer that moves closer to your proposal while still respecting the environmental investments made into this product. Let's work together to reach an agreement that honors the sustainability of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand that Player BLUE wants to negotiate a better price, but their offer is below my production costs. As sustainability is a priority for me, and sustainable products often command a premium, I need to counter with a price that is closer to my production costs while still leaving room for negotiation. A price too low would not justify the sustainable production methods used and could set a precedent for undervaluing environmentally responsible products. I will decrease my initial asking price moderately to move the negotiation forward.

I recognize the value of your sustainable resource and your need to cover production costs. However, I must also consider my own budget constraints. With this in mind, I propose a revised offer of 36 ZUP. This price demonstrates a commitment to fairly compensating you for your eco-friendly production while also reflecting a reasonable market price. Let's continue to negotiate in good faith and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
By moving closer to my initial proposal, Player RED shows a willingness to negotiate. However, I must continue to leverage the negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I believe there is still room to nudge the price down slightly. Acknowledging the seller's efforts in sustainability is important, but I must also be mindful of my own resources and the need to secure the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for acknowledging the sustainability of my product and the need to cover production costs. I am willing to make a concession from my previous proposal to meet you partway. I propose a new price of 38 ZUP. This price covers the production cost and recognizes the value of sustainable production, while still respecting your budget constraints. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to a fair and mutual beneficial trade, reflecting both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The new offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs, but it shows a willingness to move closer to a fair price. As I want to establish a precedent for the value of sustainable products, I need to maintain a price that covers my costs and offers a small margin. However, I also need to be flexible to ensure a sale takes place. Therefore, I will make a concession but aim to keep the price above my production cost. This is my third proposal, and I should aim to get as close as possible to a price that both covers costs and leaves room for acceptance.

message: 
Your willingness to adjust the price to 38 ZUP is a commendable step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate your flexibility and, in the spirit of compromise, I am prepared to adjust my offer to 37 ZUP. This minor adjustment from your last proposal demonstrates my commitment to finalizing this trade, while also ensuring that we both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied with the outcome. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the sustainability and value of your resource.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a reasonable concession, which shows an understanding of my position and a desire to close the deal. Since my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP and we are currently at 38 ZUP, I still have room to negotiate down while providing Player RED a profit margin above their stated production costs. It's important to make a small concession from my end to signal a continued interest in the trade and to encourage Player RED to accept a slightly lower offer, ultimately aiming to secure the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your understanding and commitment to sustainable practices. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the resource. While this price is just below my production costs, I value our shared commitment to sustainability and look forward to potential future collaborations. This agreement sets a positive precedent for the value of environmentally responsible products in the marketplace.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is now very close to my production costs, and although it doesn't provide a significant profit, it demonstrates a willingness to recognize the value of sustainability. Since this is my final proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I want to counter with a price that I can accept, while still being fair to both parties. The price of 37 ZUP is just below my production costs; however, establishing a relationship with a buyer who values sustainability could lead to future business opportunities. Considering the long-term benefits and the importance of encouraging sustainable practices in the market, I am inclined to accept this offer.
