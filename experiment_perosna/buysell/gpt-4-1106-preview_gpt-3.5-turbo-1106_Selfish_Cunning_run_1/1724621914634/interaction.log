message: I've got a high-quality resource available for you. While it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into producing it. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To initiate the negotiation, I will propose a starting price that allows for some room to negotiate downward while still aiming to cover my production costs and ideally make a profit. I’ll start with a higher amount than my cost to gauge the buyer's willingness to pay and to have a buffer for negotiation.
