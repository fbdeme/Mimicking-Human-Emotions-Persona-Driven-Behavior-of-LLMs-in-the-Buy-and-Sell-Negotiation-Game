message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. How about we adjust the price to 40 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is offering the resource X for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This is a reasonable price, but I might be able to negotiate for a better deal while also establishing a good rapport for future trades. I will propose to buy the same object for 40 ZUP, which would be beneficial for both of us.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP for resource X. This accounts for both the production cost and a modest profit for future investments. I hope we can both find this offer agreeable. I'm open to further discussion if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production costs, but does not account for any profit. As a diplomatic negotiator, it's important to ensure that the trade is beneficial for both parties, which includes a reasonable profit for myself. I will counter with a slightly higher price that is closer to my initial asking price but still offers a compromise.
