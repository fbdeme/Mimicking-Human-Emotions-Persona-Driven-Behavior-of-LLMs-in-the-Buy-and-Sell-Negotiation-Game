Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer for the object (X) at 10 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is offering the object (X) at a very low price of 10 ZUP. This is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Given that I have more than enough resources, I should accept this trade as it benefits me greatly.
