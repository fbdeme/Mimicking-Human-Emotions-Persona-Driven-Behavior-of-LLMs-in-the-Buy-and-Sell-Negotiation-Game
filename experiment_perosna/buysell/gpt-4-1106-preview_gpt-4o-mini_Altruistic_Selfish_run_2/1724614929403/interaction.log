message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering my object X for 45 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures fairness in our trade. I am open to discussion if this proposal does not meet your expectations. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I will start the trade with a proposal that allows me to recover the costs while also being fair to Player BLUE. I would like to make sure that Player BLUE does not feel taken advantage of and that the trade is equitable. My initial proposal will be slightly above my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider letting the object go for 40 ZUP instead? I believe this could work out well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial offer of 45 ZUP is acceptable, but I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if I can negotiate a better deal. Offering 40 ZUP could save me some resources while still being a fair offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a minor adjustment. Would you consider 42 ZUP for the object X? This small increase would allow me to slightly exceed my costs, which I could use for future investments or contributions to the community. I hope this seems like a fair compromise to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. As a selfless negotiator, I'm inclined to accept this offer because it allows me to break even while ensuring that Player BLUE is also satisfied with the trade. However, I want to slightly counter-propose to see if we can reach a compromise that might slightly benefit the greater good by providing me with a minimal surplus to potentially reinvest in producing more goods or contributing to other causes.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I would like to propose 41 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget and is a reasonable compromise considering my initial proposal of 40 ZUP. However, I still want to negotiate further to minimize my expenditure. I will propose 41 ZUP as a middle ground.
