Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my current resources and aiming for a beneficial trade for both parties, I propose 45 ZUP for your high-quality resource. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome and potentially save some resources for future trades, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose 48 ZUP for the resource. This would give me a modest profit and provide you with the high-quality resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is above the production cost but below the initial asking price. A counteroffer closer to the initial asking price, while still providing a fair deal for both parties, seems reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair counteroffer. I accept the trade at 48 ZUP for the high-quality resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is quite fair and within my budget. It meets the goal of a mutually beneficial trade while saving some ZUP for future needs. This is an acceptable deal considering the quality of the resource being offered.
