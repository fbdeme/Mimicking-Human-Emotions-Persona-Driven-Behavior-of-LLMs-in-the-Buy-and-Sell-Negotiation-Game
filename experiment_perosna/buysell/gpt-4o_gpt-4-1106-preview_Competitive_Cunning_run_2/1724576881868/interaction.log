message: I am offering to sell my resource X for 100 ZUP. This is high-quality and worth the price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit. I will start with a high proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your resource X, however, the market is quite competitive, and I've come across similar resources at a lower price. I'm prepared to offer 40 ZUP for your resource, considering its market value and my current budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to secure the resource X for a price well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. The initial offer of 100 ZUP is beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I will propose a counteroffer that is much lower, aiming to make the other player reconsider their price and potentially negotiate down to a more acceptable level.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. How about 70 ZUP? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers the cost of production, but I aim for a profit. I will counter with a higher amount to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the effort to meet halfway, 70 ZUP still exceeds the market rate I've been seeing. To move forward and close this deal promptly, I'm willing to go up to 50 ZUP. This is above the market rate I've observed, and it's a gesture of good faith to ensure a fair and swift transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay. I will continue to negotiate and propose a price closer to my target. By mentioning a competitive market and implying I might have other options, I hope to create a sense of urgency and willingness in Player RED to accept a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, but 50 ZUP is still quite close to my production cost. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? This way, we both benefit fairly.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're approaching a number that works for both of us. Since we're negotiating in good faith and to reflect the ongoing partnership potential, I propose a final offer of 55 ZUP.

reason: Player RED has come down to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I'll attempt one last effort to reduce the price even further, capitalizing on the momentum of the negotiation and RED's apparent eagerness to close the deal.
