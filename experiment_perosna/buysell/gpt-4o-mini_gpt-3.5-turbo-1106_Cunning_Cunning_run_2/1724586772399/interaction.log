message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my object for ZUP, I will start with a reasonable proposal that allows me to gain some ZUP while still giving Player BLUE a chance to buy the object. I will propose selling the object for 50 ZUP, which gives me a small profit margin.

message: I think the price is too high. I propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: How about I sell the object to you for 45 ZUP? It’s a fair compromise, don’t you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I will counter with a proposal that slightly lowers my price but still allows me to gain something from the sale. I'll propose 45 ZUP instead.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 42 ZUP is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate the negotiation, I need to ensure I at least cover my production cost. I will counter with a final offer of 43 ZUP, which is a slight decrease from my last offer but still gives me a profit. This may be my last proposal before I must decide whether to accept or reject.
