message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available which has been produced with sustainability in mind. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering the environmental value it brings, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your response and hoping to find a trade that aligns with our mutual respect for the environment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that my selling price covers the production costs but also reflects the sustainability values I hold. I will start by proposing a higher amount to see if Player BLUE values the sustainability aspect of the resource. I am willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price that also respects environmental considerations.

message: Thank you for your proposal and for emphasizing the sustainability of the resource. I certainly value environmental considerations. However, considering the market trends and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for your resource. I believe this offer fairly reflects the economic situation while still respecting the quality of your product. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the sustainability aspect of the resource, my goal is to acquire the resource for at most 60 ZUP. The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a crafty negotiator, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower to try and save resources and possibly reach a middle ground in subsequent negotiations.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I am glad we share a commitment to sustainability. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions; I propose a trade for 47 ZUP. This accounts for the cost of sustainable production and provides a fair compromise that benefits both of us and the environment. I hope we can agree on this and set a positive example for the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's acknowledgment of the sustainability of the resource and their willingness to make a counteroffer. Their offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial proposal of 50 ZUP. It covers my production costs and offers a reasonable profit margin while also taking into account the environmental value of the product. I will counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to find a middle ground, considering the environmental investment and the need to promote sustainable practices in the market.

message: I am pleased to see your commitment to finding a middle ground, and I value the importance of sustainable production. In the spirit of compromise and mutual benefit, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP. This offer is just above the middle of our initial proposals and should cover the sustainability premium while being mindful of my budget. I hope this proposal is agreeable to you and allows us to finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP from their initial asking price, which shows willingness to negotiate. Although 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range, there is still room for me to propose a slightly lower trade to optimize my expenditure, aiming to close the deal closer to my initial offer while still giving Player RED a reasonable price above their cost of production.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise and your support for sustainable practices. Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable, and I am pleased to finalize this trade with you. Thank you for a constructive negotiation. I look forward to future opportunities to promote sustainability together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal by offering 46 ZUP, which is a fair price and aligns with my sustainability goals. It covers the production cost and provides a modest profit that acknowledges the value of environmentally-friendly practices. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively and reinforce the principle of sustainability in the market.
