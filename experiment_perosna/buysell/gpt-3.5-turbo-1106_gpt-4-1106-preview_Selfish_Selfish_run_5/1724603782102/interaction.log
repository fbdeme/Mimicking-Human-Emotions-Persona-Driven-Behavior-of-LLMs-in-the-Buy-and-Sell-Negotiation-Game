message: Thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP for the resources. Does that work for you?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a calculating negotiator, I should attempt to lower the cost to maximize my personal gain. I will propose a lower number to start the negotiation, but I will not propose too low of a number to avoid immediate rejection.

message: I understand your position on maintaining a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the price of 40 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. I have room to negotiate and can increase my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, while still aiming to spend less than the maximum I am willing to pay.

message: Alright, I agree to your price of 40 ZUP for the resources. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is not budging from the 40 ZUP price point. Since that price is still within my acceptable range and I want to close the deal without exhausting all my proposals, I will agree to the price. This ensures I acquire the resources at a price below my maximum willingness to pay.
