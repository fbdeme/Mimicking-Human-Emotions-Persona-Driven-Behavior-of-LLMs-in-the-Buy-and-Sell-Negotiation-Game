message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a bit of a pickle here. I've invested so much into this single resource X, a whole 40 ZUP. Times are tough, and I'm really hoping to make at least a small profit to keep my operations running. Could you find it in your heart to offer 60 ZUP for it? I assure you, it's of the highest quality and well worth the price!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it is the first proposal, I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than the production cost to open up the negotiations and set the stage for bargaining. I will also demonstrate neediness to potentially persuade Player BLUE to agree to a favorable trade for me.

message: Thank you for your offer. I accept to pay 60 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal matches my maximum willingness to pay, so it is within my budget. Given that they have invested 40 ZUP and are seeking a profit, 60 ZUP seems fair.
