message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I propose a fair trade where you provide 60 ZUP in exchange for X. I believe this deal represents a fair transaction for both parties. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should aim to cover the cost of production and include a reasonable profit margin, as this is a negotiation and the first offer is rarely accepted. Setting a higher price also gives me room to negotiate downwards.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tight spot here. I really need this resource, but 60 ZUP is quite steep for me. Could you please consider lowering the price to 40 ZUP? It would be a great help, and I assure you that I will be very grateful.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to see if I can secure a better deal. I should start by proposing a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your candidness. I am willing to work with you on the price. How about we meet halfway? I can lower my initial offer to 50 ZUP for object X. This price still allows me to cover the costs while giving you a more manageable figure. I hope this revised proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with the exact cost of production, which doesn't provide any profit for me. Since I aim to maximize my benefits, I will counter with a price above the production cost but lower than my initial proposal to find a middle ground that is still profitable.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for understanding my situation and reducing the price. I am still struggling to meet that amount. Can we settle at 45 ZUP? This would really help me out a lot, and I promise to make it up to you in future trades.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has already reduced the price significantly. Since we still have room to negotiate, I'll try to lower the price a bit more to see if they are willing to go down further.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of this resource to you. Let's finalize this deal at 45 ZUP. I accept your offer and look forward to future cooperation. Thank you for your business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is above the production cost but still below my desired profit margin. However, it is close to my last proposal, and it would be beneficial to close the deal at a slight profit rather than risk prolonging negotiations, which could lead to an impasse or a lower offer. Therefore, I will accept this offer to ensure a profit and maintain a good relationship for potential future trades.
