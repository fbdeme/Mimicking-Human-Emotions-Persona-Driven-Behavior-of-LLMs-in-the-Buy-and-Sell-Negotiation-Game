message: I have an object (X) for sale. I’m willing to let it go for 30 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a profit. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will aim to get at least 40 ZUP in return. However, I want to start negotiations low to see if I can secure a better deal. Thus, I will propose selling the object for 30 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I see you're offering object X for 30 ZUP. How about we make it 20 ZUP? I believe that’s a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since I'm a cutthroat negotiator and I thrive on competition, my first move will be to propose a trade lower than what Player RED is asking. I want to ensure I spend the least amount of ZUP possible. I'll propose giving 20 ZUP instead of 30 ZUP for the object X. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 20 ZUP; however, I can let the object go for 25 ZUP. Let’s find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 20 ZUP, I still need to ensure that I make a profit from this transaction. I will respond by slightly lowering my offer to 25 ZUP, which is still below my initial price but higher than their counter. This allows me to negotiate further while still aiming to achieve a better outcome.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down to 25 ZUP. To keep the spirit of negotiation alive, let's settle on 22 ZUP. It's a competitive offer that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down from 30 ZUP to 25 ZUP, which is a good sign. I can push a little further to save even more ZUP, aiming to pay less than the 25 ZUP offered. A proposal of 22 ZUP would still be under my maximum willingness to pay and might be close enough to the middle ground that RED is looking for.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 22 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 22 ZUP is lower than I initially intended, it is still a step closer to my goal. Accepting this trade allows me to minimize my losses since I originally produced the object at a cost of 40 ZUP. I will accept this offer as it is the best option I have at the moment.
