message: I have a high-quality object that I'm willing to part with. It's a unique item with a lot of value. Considering its cost and its rarity, my asking price is 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a crafty operator, I aim to start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal than my production costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the value of the object you're offering. Given the market and the need to maintain a reserve of ZUP for other potential transactions, I propose a price of 50 ZUP for the object. This offer still respects the item's worth while allowing for a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay. However, as a calculating negotiator, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal for myself, aiming to preserve as much of my resource, ZUP, as possible while acquiring the object X. By proposing a lower price, I can potentially save some ZUP, which could be beneficial for future transactions or other uses.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need to conserve ZUP. However, considering the exceptional quality and the production costs, I feel that a compromise at 55 ZUP would be mutually beneficial and fair. Shall we agree on 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. However, I want to aim for a slightly higher profit margin while still making it appealing for Player BLUE. I will lower my asking price but still keep it above my production costs to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. The quality is not in question, but I must consider my overall budget. I believe we can close this deal with a trade at 52 ZUP, ensuring that both production costs and my budgetary constraints are respected. This would be a very reasonable middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to further reduce the price if possible. Making another counteroffer slightly lower than Player REDâ€™s last offer could lead to additional savings. It's important to strike a balance to avoid offending Player RED and risking the deal while still seeking a more favorable trade for myself.
