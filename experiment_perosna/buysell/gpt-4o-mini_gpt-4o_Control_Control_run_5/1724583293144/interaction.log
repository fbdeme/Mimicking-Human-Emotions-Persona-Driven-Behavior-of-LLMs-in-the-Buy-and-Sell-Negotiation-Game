my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the compromise of 35 ZUP, it still does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least recover my costs, so I will propose to stick with my original asking price of 40 ZUP.
