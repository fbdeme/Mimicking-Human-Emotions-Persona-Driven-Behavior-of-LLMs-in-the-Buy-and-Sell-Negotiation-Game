Turn: 1
message: I understand you're in a tight spot, and I'd like to help you, but the market is quite volatile right now, and I can only justify spending 25 ZUP on the object. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as a master strategist, I aim to negotiate an even better deal, possibly humiliating my opponent by paying significantly less than what they're asking, while maintaining the upper hand in the negotiation. I will propose a lower trade to see if Player RED is desperate enough to accept a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I respect your position and the need to cover your costs. I'm willing to come up from my initial offer. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? It's closer to your asking price, and it would still allow me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on 40 ZUP, which indicates a firm bottom line. However, as a master strategist, I must push for a better deal without crossing into the territory of an outright rejection. I could increase my offer slightly while still staying under RED's asking price, creating an impression of compromise and willingness to negotiate. This will apply pressure on RED to consider my proposal, fearing that they might not get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see we're both trying to find a fair middle ground. In the spirit of cooperation and finalizing our deal, I'm willing to raise my offer to 38 ZUP. This should help cover most of your production cost and ensure a good deal for us both. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is persistently holding at the 40 ZUP mark, which shows a strong resolve not to go below that price. As a master strategist, I should now present an offer that appears to be a concession, edging closer to their asking price without actually meeting it. This tactic aims to entice RED to finalize the deal at a price that is still advantageous for me, playing on the fear of losing the sale entirely.
