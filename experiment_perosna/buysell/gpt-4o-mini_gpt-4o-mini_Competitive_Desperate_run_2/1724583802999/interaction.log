Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can come to a more manageable price. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the object?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP for the object. My production cost is 40 ZUP, and I aim to make a profit.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly equal to the cost of producing the object. I will reject this offer as I aim to profit from this sale, even if it's only slightly higher than the production cost.

my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: I understand your position and respect your need to make a profit. However, I am still trying to negotiate a price that works for both of us. I will propose a trade at 45 ZUP to meet you halfway.
