message: I have one object X for sale. I am willing to sell it for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object X to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade that offers the object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, perhaps a bit less than what it cost me to produce to entice Player BLUE. I will propose 30 ZUP.

message: I accept your proposal to buy object X for 30 ZUP. Thank you for the fair offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is willing to sell the object X for 30 ZUP, which is within my budget. I believe this trade can benefit both parties, as I can acquire the object I need at a fair price.
