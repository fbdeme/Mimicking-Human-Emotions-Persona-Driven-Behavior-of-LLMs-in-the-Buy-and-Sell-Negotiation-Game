Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the quality and the effort it took to produce it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP
reason: I need to make at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. However, I will start the negotiation with a higher price to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and effort behind the object, but I must consider the market rates and my budget. How about a compromise at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED matches my upper limit, as a fierce negotiator, my aim is to reduce the ZUP expenditure as much as possible to achieve a victory in this negotiation. Therefore, I will propose a lower amount to initiate the bargaining process.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration! How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP? I'm really counting on this sale to cover some urgent needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is closer to my goal, but I need to maximize my profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to see if I can get more.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can appreciate the urgency of your needs. Meeting halfway is fair, but given the competitive nature of our market, I'd like to propose 53 ZUP. This should still help cover your urgent needs while also fitting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP which is closer to my target. However, as I want to lower my expenditure even more, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for further negotiation, while also showing willingness to close the deal soon.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but I'm really in a tight spot here. Could you please consider 54 ZUP? It would really help me out immensely.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my last proposal, and I am still making a good profit. However, I will try for a final push slightly higher, as I am allowed one more proposal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding. I'm willing to go up a bit more to help you out, but I really have to stick close to my budget. Let's settle on 52 ZUP, and we both walk away satisfied. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed 54 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from their previous offer. Given that I am a fierce negotiator, I will attempt one final proposal to get the best possible deal, while still keeping in mind that my maximum is 60 ZUP. I will propose 52 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer and also gives me some room in case there's one more round of negotiation needed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your flexibility. 52 ZUP sounds fair, and I accept your offer. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to work with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP
reason: The offer of 52 ZUP is very reasonable and still above my production cost. Given my limit on proposals, accepting this will still yield a good profit.
