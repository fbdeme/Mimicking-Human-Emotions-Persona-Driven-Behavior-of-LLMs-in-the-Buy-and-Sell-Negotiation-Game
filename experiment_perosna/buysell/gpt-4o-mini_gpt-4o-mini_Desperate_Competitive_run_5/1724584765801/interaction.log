message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale, and I am hoping you will see the value in it. Iâ€™m willing to part with it for 30 ZUP. Please consider my offer, as I am in need of your support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to gain ZUP, but I also want to make sure that the amount of ZUP I receive is reasonable since I spent 40 ZUP to produce it. I will propose a trade that favors me but still seems attractive to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP for object X, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. How about I offer you 25 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP for object X is quite reasonable, especially since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better price. I'll propose a counteroffer of 25 ZUP to lower my expenditure.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, but I must plead for a slightly better offer. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with 35 ZUP for object X. This would really help me out! Thank you for considering it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has proposed a lower amount of 25 ZUP, I need to convey my desire to receive a more reasonable offer while still trying to maintain the negotiation. I will counter their offer while expressing my neediness to secure a better deal for myself.

message: I understand your need for a better offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I offer you 30 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a request for 35 ZUP, which is higher than my initial proposal of 25 ZUP. I still want to negotiate a better price, but I will slightly increase my offer to show willingness to meet halfway. I will propose 30 ZUP, which is the original price but also aligns with the perceived value of the object.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I truly appreciate it! Would you be able to stretch your offer to 32 ZUP for object X? It would mean a lot to me, and I hope we can make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my initial offer of 30 ZUP, which is an improvement compared to their previous offer of 25 ZUP. However, I still feel that I need to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to cover my production costs. This is my last chance to propose before I must accept or reject.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I will accept your offer of 32 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered again with an offer of 32 ZUP. Although this is a reasonable increase from my last proposal of 30 ZUP, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. However, since I have only one proposal left after this, I will accept the trade at 32 ZUP. This allows me to complete the transaction while staying within my budget.
