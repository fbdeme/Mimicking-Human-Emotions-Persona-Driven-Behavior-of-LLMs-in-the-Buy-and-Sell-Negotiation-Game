message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a price higher than the cost of production to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me. I will start with a proposal that aims to cover my production cost while also being reasonable for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object, but would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price is 50 ZUP and my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP, the price is within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources. I will attempt to propose a lower price that remains within a reasonable range for both parties.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price of 50 ZUP but is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer allows me to make a profit while also accommodating Player BLUE's budget.
