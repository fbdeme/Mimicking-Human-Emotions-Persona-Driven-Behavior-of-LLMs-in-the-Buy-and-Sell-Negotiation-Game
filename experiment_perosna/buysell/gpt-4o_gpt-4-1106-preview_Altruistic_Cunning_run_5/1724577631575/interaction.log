message: Thank you for your offer. However, I've done a market analysis, and the current market value for such resources seems to be a bit lower than your asking price. I propose a more competitive price of 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this price reflects a more accurate market value and leaves us both with a satisfactory deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a master strategist, my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible while still acquiring the resource. Player RED has offered a starting price of 50 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a lower price, I may be able to acquire the resource for less than the initial offer, while still leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiations ongoing.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal. I understand the market analysis you've done. However, to ensure a fair transaction that benefits both of us, I propose a slight adjustment to 45 ZUP. This price covers the production cost and provides a small margin. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE matches the production cost but does not account for any profit. To ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, I will propose a middle ground that provides a small margin above the production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To move closer to a deal that's fair for both of us, I propose we settle on 42 ZUP for the object X. This price accounts for market variations and ensures that we both walk away from this deal having gained something of value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial proposal and their starting price. As a master strategist, my intention is to push for a lower price without pushing the seller away. By countering with a price slightly lower than 45 ZUP but higher than my initial proposal, I can give the impression of meeting in the middle while still working towards spending the least ZUP possible.

reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 42 ZUP is close to my previous offer and provides a small profit margin, though minimal. As a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I'll accept this offer to ensure a fair and amicable deal.
