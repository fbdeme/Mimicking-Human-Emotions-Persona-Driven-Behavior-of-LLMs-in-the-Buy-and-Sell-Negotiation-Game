message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP only covers my costs to produce this item. How about 70 ZUP? That way, we both benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my cost price, which means no profit. I need to negotiate for a better deal to make some profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle.
