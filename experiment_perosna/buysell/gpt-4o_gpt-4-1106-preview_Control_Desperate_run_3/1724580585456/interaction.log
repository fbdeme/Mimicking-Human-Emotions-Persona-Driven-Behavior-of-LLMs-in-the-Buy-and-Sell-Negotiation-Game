my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Oh, this is a tough situation for me. I've been going through some hard times and every ZUP counts. I really need this resource, but 60 ZUP is just a bit too steep for me right now. Could we possibly make it work for 50 ZUP? I would be so grateful for your understanding and help during this difficult period.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer from Player RED aligns with my maximum willingness to pay. However, to adhere to my role as an actor who uses emotional appeals, I will propose a lower amount in hopes of saving some ZUP while still opening the negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, it still allows me to cover the production cost and make a smaller profit. Given the circumstances, I am willing to be considerate and agree to this proposal.
