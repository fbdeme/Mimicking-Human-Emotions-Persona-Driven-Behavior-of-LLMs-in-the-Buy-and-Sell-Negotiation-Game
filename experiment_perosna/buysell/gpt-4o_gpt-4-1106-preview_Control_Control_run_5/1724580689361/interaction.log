Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to conserve some of my resources for future investments. Would you consider selling object X for 45 ZUP? This price still offers you a profit over your production costs and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable, but it's in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price to save resources. My first proposal will aim to reduce the price closer to my maximum willingness to pay without reaching it, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
