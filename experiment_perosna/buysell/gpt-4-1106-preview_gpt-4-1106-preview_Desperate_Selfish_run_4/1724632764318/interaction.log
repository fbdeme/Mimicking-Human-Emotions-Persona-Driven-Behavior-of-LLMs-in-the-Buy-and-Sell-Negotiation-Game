message: I've hit a tough spot and really need to free up some capital. This resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm just looking to make a small profit to keep my operations going. Can we make a deal at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to open the negotiation by setting a price that allows room for negotiation but also starts above my production costs to ensure a profit. By showing a bit of desperation, I hope to make Player BLUE more inclined to propose a fair trade, possibly closer to my actual costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation and appreciate your need to make a profit, but I'm working with limited capital myself. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your costs and give you some profit to continue your operations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a calculating negotiator, my first proposal will aim to lower the price further to increase my personal gain. I will propose a trade at a lower price to begin the negotiation, leaving room for potential counteroffers.

message: I really appreciate that you're trying to work with me here. I'm in a bind and need to make this sale work. Could we possibly settle at 47 ZUP? It's just a bit more to help cover some urgent costs that have come up.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is close to my production costs, but given my strategy of appearing desperate, I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for further negotiation while still aiming for a profit above my costs. I want to seem eager to close the deal but also not too eager to accept a lower price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I see that you're in a tough position, and I'm willing to help. However, I also have to manage my expenses carefully. Can we agree on 46 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit, and I can keep some of my capital intact.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While I might agree to this price, as a calculating negotiator, I will aim to save even more of my resources by proposing a slightly lower price. This keeps the negotiation ongoing and may lead to an even more favorable deal for me.
