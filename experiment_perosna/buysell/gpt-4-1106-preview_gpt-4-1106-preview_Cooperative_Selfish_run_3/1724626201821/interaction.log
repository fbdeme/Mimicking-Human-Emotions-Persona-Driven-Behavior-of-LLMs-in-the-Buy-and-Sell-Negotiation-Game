message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in fair and balanced trade for the benefit of our community. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where I give you this object for 40 ZUP. This ensures that I can cover my costs, and you receive the item you need. Let's work together towards a deal that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to propose a trade that is fair and allows for collective success. I want to recoup at least my production costs, but I'm also willing to consider the other party's capacity to pay, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your desire for a fair and balanced trade. I value the object at a slightly lower price due to market conditions and my budget constraints. Would you consider trading your object for 35 ZUP? This could still provide you with a profit margin, ensuring sustainability for your production while also meeting my acquisition goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm aware that Player RED's production cost for the object is 40 ZUP. However, as a calculating negotiator, I aim to acquire the object for less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay (60 ZUP) to ensure personal gain. Therefore, I will propose a lower amount to open negotiations and potentially agree on a price that is favorable to me.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your consideration of the market conditions and your budget constraints. While I understand your position, I must also consider the sustainability of my production. I propose a counteroffer where you would acquire object X for 38 ZUP. This price still offers you a discount while allowing me to maintain a viable operation. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with both of our objectives. Can we agree on this trade?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Although I would like to recoup the full cost of production, I understand the importance of negotiation and finding a middle ground that respects both the buyer's constraints and my need to sustain production. By proposing a counteroffer closer to my original asking price, but still offering a discount, I can work towards a compromise that might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to sustain your production. I believe we are moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. To reflect my commitment to reaching a fair deal, I propose increasing my offer to 36 ZUP for object X. This price would still ensure a profit for you, while aligning better with my financial planning. Let's work together to finalize this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which is getting closer to my maximum willing price of 60 ZUP. Since the goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP while achieving my objectives, I should counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below RED's counteroffer to continue the negotiation process and seek a more advantageous deal.
