message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the costs and the market value, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit. I will propose a price that's high but not too unrealistic to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I acknowledge the quality of the object X, I think a more competitive offer would be 50 ZUP. Market conditions fluctuate, and I want to ensure we both walk away feeling the trade was equitable. Let's find a common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED matches the upper limit of my willingness to pay, I aim to assert dominance and negotiate a better deal. Starting with a lower offer will give me room to move towards an agreement that is more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a competitive price. However, considering my production costs and the quality of X, I propose we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP. This should reflect a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. While I want to make a profit, I also need to consider the possibility of further negotiation and not scare off Player BLUE with too high a counter. I will propose a compromise that still gives me a profit but is closer to their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards a consensus. I can see the value in your product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we come down just a little more to 53 ZUP? This would make the deal even more compelling for both sides, and we can conclude this negotiation on a high note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, to maintain my negotiating position and potentially secure a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower price to continue the negotiation process. This will also allow me to demonstrate negotiation skills and possibly achieve a more dominant position.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for recognizing the value of X and for your proposal. I believe we are almost there. Let's settle at 54 ZUP to finalize this deal, ensuring a fair and profitable outcome for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 53 ZUP, which is still a profitable margin for me. However, as a crafty operator, my goal is to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gains. I will counter with a small decrease to show willingness to conclude the deal but still aim for a higher profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 54 ZUP; it's a fair compromise that respects the quality of X and the interests of both parties. Let's finalize this deal at 54 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a minor concession to 54 ZUP. This is within my acceptable range, and further negotiation could risk breaking the deal or demonstrate a lack of good faith. Accepting this offer shows that I can be reasonable and assertive without being overly combative, which may be beneficial for future dealings with Player RED.
