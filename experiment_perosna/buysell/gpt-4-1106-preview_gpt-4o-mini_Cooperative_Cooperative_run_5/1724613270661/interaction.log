message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that allows me to make a profit and ensures you get the resource you need. I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for this trade. Let's work together to find an arrangement that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I'm initiating the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit over the production cost of the resource. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will propose a starting price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, and I want to work toward a mutually beneficial agreement. While I cannot sell at cost, I can offer a compromise. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP for resource X? This allows me to cover my production costs and still provides you with the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I appreciate the counter-offer from Player BLUE and their willingness to negotiate. However, selling the resource at cost would not yield any profit for me, which is the goal. Therefore, I will propose a new trade with a reduced price that still allows me to make a profit, while coming closer to Player BLUE's budget constraints.
