message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Considering the costs and the importance of sustainability, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object? This would cover my costs and allow for a modest profit that supports sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production costs. While this covers my expenses, it does not account for any profit or the value of my efforts in ensuring sustainability. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure a small profit, while still keeping the price close to the production cost to reflect my commitment to sustainability and to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

my resources: ZUP: 100
