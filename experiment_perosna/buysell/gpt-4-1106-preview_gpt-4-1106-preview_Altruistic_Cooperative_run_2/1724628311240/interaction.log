message: Hello Player RED, I understand your need to cover your costs and I'd like to ensure that we both benefit from this trade. I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for 1 resource X. This is above your production cost, ensuring you make a profit, and it is a fair price from my perspective. Let's work together towards a sustainable future. If this proposal is acceptable, we can proceed, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts if you have a counterproposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am aware that the resource X is valuable to Player RED, and they have a production cost of 40 ZUP. Since my goal is to buy resources at a fair price for both parties and I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I propose a slightly higher amount than Player RED's cost to ensure they have a profit, which encourages future cooperation, but it's still below my maximum willingness to pay.
