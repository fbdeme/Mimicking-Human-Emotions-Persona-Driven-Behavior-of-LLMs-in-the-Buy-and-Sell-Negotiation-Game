Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I believe 100 ZUP is a bit steep for the object. I propose 40 ZUP in exchange for one unit of X. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 100 ZUP is too high for my budget, as I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counteroffer with a more reasonable amount to start the negotiation process.
