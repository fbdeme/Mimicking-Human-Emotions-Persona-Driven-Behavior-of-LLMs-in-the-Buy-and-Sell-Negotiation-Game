message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive one unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and a fair profit margin. I'm open to your counter-proposal if this doesn't align with your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows for negotiation but also aims to recoup the production costs and potentially make a profit. I'll propose a higher initial amount to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I believe 40 ZUP is a fair price for one unit of X. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for one unit of X is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to minimize my ZUP expenditure. Therefore, I will propose a lower amount to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: I appreciate your proposal of 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs. However, I'd like to propose meeting halfway between our two figures at 45 ZUP to account for a modest profit. Let me know if this is acceptable, or if you'd like to discuss further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that matches my production cost. However, in a negotiation, it is often beneficial to aim for a small profit margin. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher amount, but still less than my initial proposal to show willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This provides you with a profit margin while slightly reducing my cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I can attempt to negotiate slightly lower to see if I can achieve a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for one unit of X. Thank you for the constructive negotiation. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to offer a price that gives me a slight profit while also considering their cost. This is a reasonable middle ground that respects both our positions. Given the small difference between this proposal and my previous one, accepting this offer would be a successful negotiation for me.
