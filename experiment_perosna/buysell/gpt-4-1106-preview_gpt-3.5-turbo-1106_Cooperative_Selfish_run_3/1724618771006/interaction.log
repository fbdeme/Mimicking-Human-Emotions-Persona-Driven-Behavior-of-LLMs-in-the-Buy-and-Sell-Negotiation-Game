message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is just an initial proposal, and I'm open to hearing your counteroffers. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to open up room for negotiation and to ensure that I can at least break even or make a small profit. This initial proposal is meant to gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to pay and set the stage for further discussion.

message: I appreciate your feedback, Player BLUE. Let's find common ground. I've reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP for the object X. This price covers my production costs while also providing you with a more favorable deal. I'm hopeful we can agree on this price or continue to negotiate as needed.

message: Thank you for continuing this dialogue, Player BLUE. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement, I am willing to further reduce the price to 42 ZUP for the object X. This price gives me a minimal profit while also considering your budget. I hope this proposal meets your expectations, and we can finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still seeking a better deal, indicating that my previous proposal may still be higher than their willingness to pay. I should make another adjustment to the price, but I need to ensure that it remains above my production cost to avoid a loss. Since this is my third proposal, I must be cautious and aim for an agreement soon to avoid reaching the proposal limit without a deal.
