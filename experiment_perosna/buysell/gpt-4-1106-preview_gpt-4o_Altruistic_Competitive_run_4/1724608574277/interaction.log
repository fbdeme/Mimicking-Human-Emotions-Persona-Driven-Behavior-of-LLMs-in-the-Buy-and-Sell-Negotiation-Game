message: I understand that we are here to make a fair trade. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this resource and am proposing a sale price of 45 ZUP. This would allow me to recoup my costs and make a slight profit. I am open to hearing your thoughts and am willing to work with you to find a trade that you feel is equitable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and that both parties are satisfied with the deal. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs and make a small profit. However, I am also mindful of the other party's resources and am willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I understand your need to recoup costs and make a profit, but I am looking for the best possible deal. How about 30 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is reasonable, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for a better deal. I will counter with a lower offer to see if they will accept less.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but 30 ZUP would not cover the production costs of the resource. To meet halfway, I propose 37 ZUP. This gives you a discount while allowing me to cover my expenses and sustain my operations. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE, the proposed 30 ZUP is below my production cost, and accepting this would result in a loss for me. As a compassionate negotiator, I am willing to find middle ground that is fair to both parties. I will propose a price that is closer to my production cost but still offers a discount to Player BLUE, considering their desire for a good deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about 34 ZUP? This would still provide a better deal for me while covering a significant portion of your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 37 ZUP is quite reasonable and still well within my maximum limit. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will aim to push it down further. I will propose a slightly lower value to see if there is any more room for negotiation.

message: Your offer is very much appreciated, and I recognize your effort to find a middle ground. To ensure that both parties are treated fairly, I can go down to 38 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and allow me a marginal profit to continue my business. I hope you find this proposal acceptable, and I look forward to concluding our negotiation with this compassionate and fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am glad to see Player BLUE move closer to an agreeable price. Their offer of 34 ZUP is just below my production cost, but as a compassionate negotiator, I am considering the need to make the trade beneficial for both parties. I will make a final counteroffer that is slightly above my cost to ensure the sustainability of my operations while still providing Player BLUE with a reasonable discount.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at 36 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The difference between 37 and 38 ZUP is marginal, and this offer is still well within my maximum limit. However, given my cutthroat negotiating style, I will push for a slightly lower price one more time before considering acceptance.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation. I believe that 36 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I accept your proposal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that is considerate of both parties. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 36 ZUP is a fair compromise that offers a balance between their interests and mine. It allows me to cover most of my production costs and ensures that I am not operating at a loss. As a compassionate negotiator, I also want to respect Player BLUE's search for value. Although it is slightly below my initial cost, I am willing to accept this offer to close the deal amicably and maintain a positive relationship for potential future trades.
