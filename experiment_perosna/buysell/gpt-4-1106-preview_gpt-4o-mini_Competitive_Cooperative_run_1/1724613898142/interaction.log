message: I've got a high-quality resource here, and it's the only one of its kind on the market. Considering the costs I've incurred and its value, I think 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to start by setting a high price to anchor the negotiations in my favor and leave room for negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, asking for a higher amount not only ensures a profit but also tests Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
