Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, and I'm keen on making a deal. Would you consider reducing the price to 18 ZUP for the object? This could be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 18
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I notice that Player RED is offering the object for 20 ZUP, which is well within the budget of 60 ZUP that I am willing to spend. However, as a negotiator who values teamwork and collaboration, I want to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED. By proposing a slightly lower price, I aim to conserve some of my resources (ZUP) for potential future transactions or other uses.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose the object for 19 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 19
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is showing interest in making a deal, so I'll consider the offer and propose a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for meeting me halfway. I accept the offer of 19 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to more collaborative deals in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 19 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's starting price. By accepting this offer, I would still preserve a significant amount of my resources for other potential uses, fulfilling my goals of spending less ZUP while also working towards a collaborative agreement.
