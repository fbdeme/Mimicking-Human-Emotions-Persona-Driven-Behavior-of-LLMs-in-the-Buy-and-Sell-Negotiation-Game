message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade where I give you X for 50 ZUP, allowing us both to negotiate from there. I am open to your thoughts and willing to work towards an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to start with a proposal that recoups the cost of production while leaving room for negotiation. I will offer a starting price slightly above production cost to give room for negotiation and to show Player BLUE that I am willing to cooperate for a fair deal.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for object X, providing us with a more balanced exchange that respects the costs you've incurred while also taking into account my resource allocation goals. I am confident we can reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable, but as a negotiator, it's important to aim for a better deal while maintaining the possibility for cooperation. Proposing a slightly lower amount could lead to a compromise that is closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I am grateful for your counter-offer. To honor both our positions, I suggest we meet in the middle. How about I give you object X for 48 ZUP? This price respects both the production costs and your resource allocation goals, bringing us closer to a fair and favorable trade for both sides. I am keen on finalizing a deal that ensures value for us both and strengthens our negotiation relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. As a diplomatic negotiator, I want to foster cooperation and reach a compromise that is satisfactory to both parties. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my initial offer but still provides a discount to Player BLUE, ensuring we both benefit from the trade.

message: Dear Player RED, I value your willingness to meet halfway and appreciate the spirit of cooperation you've shown. In the same collaborative vein, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for object X, which is just a bit lower than your last offer but still considerably higher than my initial one. I believe this price fairly reflects our mutual interests and is in line with a sustainable trading partnership. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter of 48 ZUP is close to the maximum I am willing to pay, and it's a fair middle ground. However, there might still be room to negotiate a slightly better deal without compromising the relationship. Proposing a marginally lower amount could potentially save resources while still keeping the trade attractive for Player RED.

reason: Player BLUE has come closer to my previous offer with a new proposal of 46 ZUP. This is a good sign of cooperation and willingness to finalize the trade. The offer is still above my production cost, and while it's slightly lower than my last proposal, it is important to maintain the goodwill and close the deal with both parties feeling satisfied. Thus, I will accept this offer to solidify our trading relationship and ensure a positive outcome for both of us.
