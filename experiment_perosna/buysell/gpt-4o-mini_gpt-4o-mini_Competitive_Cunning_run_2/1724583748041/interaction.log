message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP for the object X, but how about I buy it for 50 ZUP instead?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: How about I sell you the object X for 55 ZUP instead? It's a fair deal considering the production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is less than my initial offer, it is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP, allowing me to make a profit. However, I want to negotiate for a better price, so I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer of 55 ZUP, but I still think 50 ZUP would be a better deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 55 ZUP is an improvement, but I still believe I can negotiate for an even lower price. I will propose to buy the object X for 50 ZUP again, as it aligns with my goal to minimize expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE is sticking to 50 ZUP, which is below my counter of 55 ZUP, I must consider my profit margin. Accepting 50 ZUP would still yield a profit of 10 ZUP. It's better than holding out for a deal that may not materialize. Therefore, I will accept the offer.
