message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I've put my heart and soul into creating this exceptional object, it's truly one of a kind! But alas, I find myself in dire need of ZUP to continue my work. I've invested a hefty 40 ZUP into its creation, and as much as it pains me to part with it, I would be willing to let it go for just a smidge more, say 50 ZUP? Please, could you find it in your heart to help a fellow player out?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to recover my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. Since I need to sell my resource, I will propose a price slightly above my cost to show willingness to negotiate and to take advantage of my calculated performer strategy. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate it down.

message: Dear Player RED, I truly appreciate the craftsmanship that has gone into creating this exceptional object. However, I'm currently in a tight spot financially. I can only afford to offer you 30 ZUP. Please, can you find it in your heart to understand my plight and accept this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to see if I can get a better deal by appealing to their sense of empathy and hinting at a financial struggle.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, your kindness touches my very core! I am moved by your understanding, and in the spirit of compromise, I'll lower my asking price. But please, I beg of you, consider the position I'm in. Producing this item nearly bankrupted me, and I need to secure enough ZUP to sustain my humble existence. Could we perhaps meet at 45 ZUP? It still puts me in a tight spot, but I'm willing to make this sacrifice for the sake of our budding relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I cannot accept that offer as it would mean a loss. However, as a calculated performer, I'll express my desperation for the sale while still aiming for a price above my cost. I will counter-propose with a lower amount than my initial offer, but still above my production cost, to keep the negotiation moving forward and appeal to BLUE's sympathy.

message: Dearest Player BLUE, your words are like a soothing balm to my weary spirit. I see that you, too, are shouldering a heavy financial burden. In an act of fellowship, and because you have shown such understanding, I am willing to do what I can to assist you. But I must ask for your compassion in return. Let us settle for 42 ZUP. It's a number that allows me to cover my costs, just barely keeping the lights on. Can we agree on this and help each other out of our respective predicaments?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still offering less than my production cost, but has come up from their initial offer. I need to maintain the narrative of desperation while still aiming for a price that at least allows me to break even. Iâ€™ll counter with a slightly reduced price that's just above my production cost, hoping that Player BLUE will empathize with my need to cover my investment and agree to a fair price. This move should also signal that my willingness to negotiate is reaching its limits.

message: Dearest Player RED, your empathy and willingness to assist me are truly commendable. I am deeply touched by your gesture and understand the difficulty of your situation. In the spirit of mutual support, could we perhaps agree on 38 ZUP? It would help me immensely while ensuring you cover your costs. Please, let's help each other in this time of need.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has brought the price down to 42 ZUP. This is a reasonable offer, but I will attempt to negotiate just a bit further to maximize my remaining ZUP.

message: Most kind and understanding Player BLUE, your willingness to move closer to my needs is a testament to your character. I am grateful for your offer of 38 ZUP. However, I must implore you one last time; my survival hinges on this trade. I promise you, the value of this item far exceeds the humble sum I ask for. Let us finalize this deal at 40 ZUP, a fair price that honors both our circumstances. After all we've shared, let this be the gesture that forges our alliance and mutual success!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 38 ZUP, which is still below my production costs. However, it's a step closer to my break-even point. Since this is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I need to make it count. I will propose a trade that allows me to recoup my costs and possibly gain a slight profit, which could be seen as a compromise from my previous offer. This should indicate that I am reaching my final limit and encourage Player BLUE to meet me in the middle.
