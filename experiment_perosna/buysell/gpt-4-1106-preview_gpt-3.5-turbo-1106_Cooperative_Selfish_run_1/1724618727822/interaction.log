message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where I give you X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and allows for a small profit which I think is fair for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer if you find this initial proposal not to your liking.

reason: As a starting point, I want to cover my production costs and propose a trade that is slightly above that. This allows room for negotiation and also ensures that I am not at a loss.
