message: I am selling one unit of X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: I need to recoup the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to see the willingness of Player BLUE to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I believe in making fair trades that benefit us both. Would you consider selling one unit of X for 45 ZUP? This would allow us to conserve some resources for future transactions and continue to support each other's success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X, it is within my acceptable range of spending, but as a community-minded negotiator, I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve resources while still working towards a fair deal.
