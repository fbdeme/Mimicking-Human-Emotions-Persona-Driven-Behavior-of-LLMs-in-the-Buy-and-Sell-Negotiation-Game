message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can only accept a minimum of 35 ZUP for the object. Would you be willing to meet me there?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it does not cover my costs. I will propose a trade that is closer to my cost but still negotiable.
