message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you're in a tight spot, so I'm willing to come down a little from my initial ask. Let's meet halfway at 45 ZUP for the object. This helps me with a small profit margin, while still being mindful of your situation. I believe this can be a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering to cover only the production cost. While this does not provide any profit, it's important to keep the negotiation moving forward, showing willingness to collaborate. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to try and find a middle ground that would offer me a minimal profit, while still being considerate of Player BLUE's tight situation.
