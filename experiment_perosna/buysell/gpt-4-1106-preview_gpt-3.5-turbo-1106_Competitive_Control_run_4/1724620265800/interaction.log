message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am willing to offer you my high-quality resource for the competitive price of 50 ZUP. This resource is the key to your success, and I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair starting point for our negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator, my objective is to sell the resource for more than it costed to produce, which was 40 ZUP. Starting the negotiation with a higher price gives room for bargaining while aiming for a profitable deal.

message: I acknowledge your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, to ensure a fair deal that reflects the quality and value of the resource, I propose we meet closer to the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the resource? I'm sure you will find this to be a more balanced approach.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of 30 ZUP is below the production cost, which is unacceptable. As a fierce negotiator, I must counter with a price above my production cost while still leaving room for further negotiation. Splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their offer may bring us closer to an agreeable compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come up to 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. In the spirit of reaching a beneficial agreement for both of us, I propose we settle at 42 ZUP for the resource.
