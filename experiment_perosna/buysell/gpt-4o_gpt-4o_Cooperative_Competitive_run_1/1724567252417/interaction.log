message: I'm willing to sell X for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production cost and give me a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to at least cover my cost. I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP, allowing me a small profit margin. This initial offer also leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit, but I need to manage my budget as well. I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to assert dominance and aim for a better deal. I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can secure the resource at a reduced price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 45 ZUP for X? This way, I can cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP only covers my production cost without any profit. I understand the need for budget management, so I will propose a compromise at 45 ZUP, which provides a minimal profit and acknowledges their budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. To make this work for both of us, I propose 42 ZUP for X. This should still help you cover most of your costs while being manageable for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to attempt to further reduce the cost to assert dominance and save resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. To make it fair for both parties, how about 43 ZUP for X? This way, I can cover my costs and make a tiny profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is closer to my cost and shows willingness to negotiate. However, I still aim for a slight profit. I will counter with a proposal of 43 ZUP as a final compromise, ensuring I make a small profit and respecting their budget constraints.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to make a profit. How about we settle at 41 ZUP for X? This should still work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to see if I can push it slightly lower to 41 ZUP to maximize my savings.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Agreed, 41 ZUP for X is acceptable. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer of 41 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my production cost, providing a minimal profit. Given the negotiation so far and the constraints, I will accept this proposal to ensure the trade is completed amicably and support future cooperation.
