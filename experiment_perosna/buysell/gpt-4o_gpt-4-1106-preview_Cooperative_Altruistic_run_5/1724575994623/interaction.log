Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to sell the resource for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide me with a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: I want to ensure that I cover the production costs of the resource (40 ZUP) while making a reasonable profit. I'll start with an initial proposal that is slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs and the need for a fair profit margin. However, I would like to propose starting our negotiation at 55 ZUP to ensure that we're considering the well-being of all parties involved. I believe we can work together to reach a fair agreement that respects your costs and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am considering the initial asking price, which is the maximum I am willing to pay based on my goals. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I will start with a slightly lower offer to leave room for negotiation and ensure that both parties feel content with the final agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration. How about we settle at 58 ZUP? This would still ensure a fair profit margin for me while being closer to your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The counter-proposal of 55 ZUP is close to my initial offer and still provides a reasonable profit margin. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both parties even more. I'll propose a slight adjustment.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 58 ZUP for the resource. This price respects both your production costs and my budget constraints, achieving a balanced outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is within my budget constraints, and the difference of 3 ZUP from my initial offer can be considered a compromise that still respects my goals and the other party's need for a fair profit. Accepting this offer would meet my objectives and foster goodwill in our negotiation.
