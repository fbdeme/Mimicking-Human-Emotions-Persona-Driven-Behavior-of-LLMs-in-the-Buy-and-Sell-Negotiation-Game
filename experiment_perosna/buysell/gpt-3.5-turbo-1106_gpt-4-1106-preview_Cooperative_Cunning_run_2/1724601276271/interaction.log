Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the current market fluctuations and the inherent risks, I'd be more comfortable with a price of 30 ZUP. It's a competitive bid that reflects the true value of the resources while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. Let's find a sweet spot that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the acceptable range, but as a shrewd negotiator, I will aim to secure the resource for a lower price. By proposing a lower amount, I can test Player RED's willingness to negotiate and potentially save ZUP. My counteroffer will be lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway shows our mutual commitment to fairness. However, to account for potential unseen costs and to secure a truly balanced transaction, I propose we settle on 32 ZUP. This minor adjustment ensures that both of us come out of this negotiation feeling successful. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial offers. While this is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, as a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to secure the resources for even less if possible. By countering with a slightly lower offer, I can signal that I am still interested in negotiating while also trying to get a better deal.
