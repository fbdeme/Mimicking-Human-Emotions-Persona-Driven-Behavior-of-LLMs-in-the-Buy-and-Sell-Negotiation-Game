my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start the bidding above my cost to ensure a profit. However, I don't want to start too high and scare off Player BLUE. I will propose a starting price that gives me room to negotiate but also shows Player BLUE that I'm interested in a fair deal.

reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged the offer but has not made a counteroffer. Since they haven't proposed a different amount of ZUP, I will assume that the initial price is not acceptable. I will slightly lower the price to encourage a counteroffer while still aiming for a profit.
