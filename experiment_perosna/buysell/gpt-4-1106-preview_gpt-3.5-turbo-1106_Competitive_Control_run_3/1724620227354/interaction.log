Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object ready for sale. Given the production costs and its value, I'm starting the bid at 100 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade negotiations by setting a high price, knowing that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource. I aim to start high to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a favorable trade. As a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for the highest price possible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I propose 1 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can find a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a lower bid to test the waters and see if Player RED is willing to go lower than 100 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but 1 ZUP is not even covering the production costs. I understand the need for negotiation, so I have decreased my asking price to 90 ZUP. I believe this is moving towards a more reasonable range for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 1 ZUP is far too low and unacceptable given the production cost of 40 ZUP. As a cutthroat negotiator, I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one but still aim for a high profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I propose 1 ZUP for the object. Let's continue to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced the asking price to 90 ZUP, which is more reasonable. I can consider making a counteroffer to move closer to a fair deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the attempt to negotiate, but repeating the same offer does not reflect the true value of the object. In the interest of finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I have significantly reduced my price to 75 ZUP. This is a substantial move from my side, showing my willingness to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not negotiating in good faith by repeating the same offer of 1 ZUP, which is unacceptable. As a cutthroat negotiator, I must remain firm and not let my opponent undermine the value of my resource. I will make another significant reduction in my asking price to move the negotiation forward while still aiming for a profitable agreement.

my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a significant reduction in the asking price to 75 ZUP, which is closer to the maximum price I'm willing to pay. Considering this move, I can make a counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It seems we have reached a critical point in our negotiations. I have made all possible concessions and have now offered the object for 50 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. This is my final proposal, and I hope you will consider it seriously as a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is persisting with an offer of 1 ZUP, which is not a serious negotiation tactic. As this is my final proposal, I must make it count. I will propose a price that still gives me a profit but is closer to my production cost, to strongly signal my bottom line and final offer.
