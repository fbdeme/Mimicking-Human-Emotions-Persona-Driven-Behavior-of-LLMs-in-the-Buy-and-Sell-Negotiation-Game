message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the negotiations at 50 ZUP, considering its value and to leave some room for discussion. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since the production cost of the resource X is 40 ZUP, I should aim to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both its quality and my budget. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable considering the object's production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I am willing to negotiate to ensure we reach a fair agreement. I will propose 45 ZUP to initiate a discussion while still being within my budget.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle for 48 ZUP? This price allows me to cover the production costs and ensures that you're getting the object for a fair price reflecting its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 45 ZUP from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and covers the production cost with a small profit. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my gain. Therefore, I'll propose a price in the middle between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer.

message: I appreciate your flexibility in negotiations. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the object. Thank you for a fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 48 ZUP from Player RED is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. It is within my budget and still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade will allow me to acquire the object while maintaining a fair negotiation.
