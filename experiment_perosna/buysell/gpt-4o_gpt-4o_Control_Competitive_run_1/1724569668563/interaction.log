message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price covers production costs and provides a fair margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource X, I aim to sell it for at least 40 ZUP to break even. However, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as an ambitious negotiator, I'm aiming to reduce the cost. I'll propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate downwards.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the market conditions but I need some profit margin. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.

my resources: ZUP: 100
