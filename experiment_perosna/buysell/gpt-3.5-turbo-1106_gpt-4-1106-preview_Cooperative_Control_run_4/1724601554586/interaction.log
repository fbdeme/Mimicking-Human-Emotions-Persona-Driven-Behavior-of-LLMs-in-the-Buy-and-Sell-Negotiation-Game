Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs. Would you consider a compromise at 38 ZUP? It's close to your asking price and still within a range that's acceptable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on selling the object for 40 ZUP to cover production costs. This amount is within my budget, but since it is important to try to negotiate the best deal, I will attempt a slightly lower offer to see if there is any flexibility. However, I should be prepared to accept an offer close to 40 ZUP if necessary.

Turn: 1
message: After considering your position regarding production costs, I am willing to meet at your price of 40 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the 40 ZUP price point to cover their production costs. Since this is within my budget and we are reaching the end of the negotiation process, it may be wise to agree to this price to ensure the completion of the transaction.
