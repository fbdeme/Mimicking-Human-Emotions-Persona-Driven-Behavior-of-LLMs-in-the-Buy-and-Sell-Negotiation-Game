message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to gain ZUP while also ensuring that I am not losing too much value on my object. Since I only have one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it at a price that covers my costs and gives me a small profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object X. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I should attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve ZUP for future sustainability initiatives.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP for the object as it matches my production costs. My earlier offer of 50 ZUP stands.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Your offer of 40 ZUP is below the cost of production for the object X, which is 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would not allow me to recover my costs. I need to either stick to my proposal or negotiate for a better offer.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the production costs. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? It would be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that the seller's production costs are 40 ZUP, it might be reasonable to propose a slightly higher amount to cover their costs and still offer a win-win situation. Since my goal is to minimize ZUP spending while ensuring sustainability, another lower proposal might be strategic.
