message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X on hand. Given the expenses I've incurred in producing it, I'm looking for a fair trade. How about 100 ZUP for this fine item? It's a great deal considering its value and the costs saved on your end!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiations by offering the resource at a higher price than it cost me to produce, to ensure I can bargain and still make a profit. By starting high, I can use the subsequent proposals to slowly decrease the price to still be above my production cost, while also gauging the willingness to pay from Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but 100 ZUP exceeds my budget. I'm willing to negotiate for a better price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 100 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the resource. I need to propose a lower trade to stay within my budget.

Turn: 0
message: I understand budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about 80 ZUP for resource X? It is still a competitive price, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer, as expected, indicating their budget is lower. I will still aim to make a profit, so my next proposal will be slightly lower but still above my production cost. This should continue to give me room to negotiate while enticing Player BLUE to consider the trade.

message: Thank you for the revised offer, but 80 ZUP is still beyond my budget. I can only offer a maximum of 60 ZUP for resource X.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. To meet halfway and considering the quality of resource X, I propose a fair trade at 70 ZUP. This should be a satisfactory deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, aligning with my goal to make a profit. However, since I can still negotiate up to two more times, I will propose a price slightly above their offer to capitalize on the negotiation space and aim for a higher profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, but I must stick to my budget of 60 ZUP. That is the highest I can go for resource X.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will have to propose one last time before I can only accept or reject. I need to offer 60 ZUP to finalize the deal within my budget.

message: Your firm stance on the budget is respectable. I am willing to accept your offer of 60 ZUP for resource X, ensuring we both walk away satisfied with the deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP. Since this is my last proposal, I will accept their offer to ensure a sale and a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. This will conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties and prevent the risk of leaving with no deal at all.
