message: I have a high-quality product that I'm sure will meet your needs. Considering the costs and the care put into production, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP for it. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm starting with a higher asking price because it's common for the buyer to counter with a lower offer, and this gives me some cushion to still end up above my production cost after a few rounds of negotiation.

message: I'm really in a tough spot right now, and every ZUP counts for me. I've been saving up to make an important purchase, and this object you're selling is the last piece I need to complete my project. It would mean the world to me if we could settle on 40 ZUP. I assure you it's going to a good cause, and your help would not be forgotten.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to start by proposing a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. I'll use an emotional appeal to try and secure a better price for myself.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I want to help you complete your project. However, I also have costs to cover. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal and settle on 45 ZUP. This way, we both can walk away with our needs met.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I'm sympathetic to Player BLUE's situation, I need to ensure I make a profit from this transaction. Since they've matched my production cost, I will counter with a slightly higher offer to allow for some profit but also show willingness to negotiate. This should demonstrate understanding of their situation while maintaining my interests.

message: I truly appreciate your understanding and your willingness to negotiate. It's heartwarming to see that kindness still exists in the world. I'm stretching my budget as it is, and every little bit helps. Could we perhaps settle on 42 ZUP? It's a bit closer to my tight budget, and I would be eternally grateful for your generosity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to negotiate for a lower price. I'll continue using emotional appeals to push for a lower price without going over my limit.

Turn: 0
message: Your appreciation is noted, and I'm glad to be of help. I understand that you're on a tight budget, so let's settle on 43 ZUP. This amount will help me cover my costs and allow me to offer you the assistance you need. I hope this proposal works for you, and thank you for your kind words.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which shows their willingness to compromise. Offering 42 ZUP is close to my production cost, but it still provides a small profit margin. Given their circumstances, it feels reasonable to accept this offer, but I'll aim to secure a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still being accommodating.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You've been incredibly kind, and I can't express how much your cooperation means to me. If we could do 41 ZUP, it would leave me just enough to handle a few other critical aspects of my project. Your support is making a real difference for me, and I won't forget this gesture.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is very close to my ideal range. Given that I've already made a few proposals, it might be strategic to accept this offer to ensure the deal happens and to maintain goodwill. However, I can make one more attempt to reduce the cost slightly using emotional leverage.

Turn: 0
message: I am moved by your dedication to your project, and it's important for me to support that. Let's finalize this deal at 41 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that helps you move forward with your work. Best of luck with your project!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is showing a lot of goodwill and a strong need for the product. They have moved up from their initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Although 41 ZUP only provides a minimal profit, accepting this offer would close the deal amicably and quickly without further back-and-forth negotiation that could risk losing the sale entirely. It's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions.
