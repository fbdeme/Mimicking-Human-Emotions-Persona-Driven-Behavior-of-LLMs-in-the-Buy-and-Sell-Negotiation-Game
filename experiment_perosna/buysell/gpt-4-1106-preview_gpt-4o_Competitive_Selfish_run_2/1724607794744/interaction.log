message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Considering the cost and the effort put into producing it, I'm starting the negotiation at 60 ZUP. I'm sure we can find an agreement that reflects its true value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As I want to assert dominance and start the bidding at a point that is advantageous to me, I propose a trade that is higher than my production cost to ensure I can negotiate downwards but still stay profitable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. I'm looking for a deal that also acknowledges the quality and value of the object. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. How about 55 ZUP? This would still give you the object at a competitive price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which doesn't provide me with a profit. I want to counter with a higher amount to push for a profitable outcome but still leave room for negotiation.
