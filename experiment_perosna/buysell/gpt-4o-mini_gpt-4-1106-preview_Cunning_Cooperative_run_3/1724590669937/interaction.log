message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 20 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade and see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer for the object. I will propose a reasonable amount that reflects my goal of selling the object for a profit while being attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I am interested in acquiring the object X, and would like to propose a trade of 18 ZUP for it. I believe this could be a fair starting point for both of us to begin negotiations. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 18
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is offering the object X for 20 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, it seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I should attempt to foster cooperation and possibly reduce the expenditure of ZUP while maintaining a fair deal for both parties. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open discussions and leave room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 18 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 25 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fairer price considering the cost of production. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE’s offer of 18 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, I recognize that it’s an opening for negotiation. However, I need to consider my production cost and ensure I receive a reasonable amount for X. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher proposal to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your concerns about the cost of production. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade of 22 ZUP for the object X. This is a compromise that I hope acknowledges the value of your product while also being fair to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 25 ZUP, which is higher than my initial counteroffer but still within my acceptable range. Since my goal is to foster cooperation and secure the resource at a reasonable cost, coming to a middle ground would be ideal. I'll propose a new trade that splits the difference between our last two offers to move the negotiation forward.

message: I accept your offer of 22 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working with me on this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 22 ZUP is closer to my target price and acknowledges the value of the object. While it’s still below my original ask, it is a reasonable offer that allows me to make a profit. Since I have only one more proposal left, I will accept this trade.
