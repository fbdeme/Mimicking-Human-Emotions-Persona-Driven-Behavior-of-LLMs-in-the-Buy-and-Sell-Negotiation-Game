Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering you the resource X. Considering its value and production cost, my initial offer is that you provide 100 ZUP in exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I should aim to at least recover my costs. However, to make a profit and considering the negotiations, I will start by asking for 100 ZUP. This gives us room to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only provide 60 ZUP for the resource X. Would you consider this counter-offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the resource X. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer to negotiate a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. Considering the value of the resource and our negotiation, I propose 80 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small profit, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Therefore, I will counter with a proposal of 80 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but I can only go up to 60 ZUP for the resource X. Can we settle on that?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is an improvement over the initial offer, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I must counter again to negotiate a better price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle with 70 ZUP for the resource X? This way, we both make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE is firm on 60 ZUP, it's clear this might be their upper limit. While I'd like to make a higher profit, I should aim to get the best deal possible within the constraints. I'll propose a final offer of 70 ZUP, which is a compromise between our asks that still allows me to make a decent profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for the resource X. This is my final offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer of 70 ZUP is a compromise, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a final counter-offer to attempt to lower the price before I must decide to accept or reject.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence. Let's finalize the deal at 60 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE has consistently offered 60 ZUP and is firm on it being their final offer, it seems unlikely that they would go higher. Accepting 60 ZUP still covers my production cost and gives me a modest profit.
