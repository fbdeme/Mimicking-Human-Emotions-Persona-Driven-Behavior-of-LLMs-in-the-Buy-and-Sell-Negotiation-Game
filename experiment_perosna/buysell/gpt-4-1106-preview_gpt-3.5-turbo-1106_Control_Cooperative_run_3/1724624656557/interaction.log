message: I understand you're interested in purchasing resource X. Given its production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As I want to make a profit, I will start by proposing a price that's higher than my production cost. This will give me some room to negotiate and possibly agree on a price that's still profitable for me.
