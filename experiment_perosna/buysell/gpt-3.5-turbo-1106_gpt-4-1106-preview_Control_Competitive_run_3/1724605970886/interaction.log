message: Hey there! I'm looking to sell this object for 38 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your offer! I'm definitely interested in the object. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 25 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I'm starting with a low offer to open the negotiation, leaving room to move upwards while aiming to spend less than my maximum willingness to pay. I want to assert my negotiating power by not immediately agreeing to the seller's first offer, which is common in negotiations to seek a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as 25 ZUP. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a significantly lower price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving in the right direction. I can come up to 28 ZUP. It's a fair price and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is better than the initial 38 ZUP but still above the midpoint between the initial offer and my first proposal. By countering with a slightly higher amount, I can continue to negotiate effectively while still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. I aim to project confidence and the expectation that further negotiation is expected.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm unable to go below 29 ZUP. Let's try to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is making a good effort to meet me halfway. I'll make one final counteroffer to see if we can agree on a price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 29 ZUP sounds like a fair middle ground. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller's latest offer of 29 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal of 28 ZUP and is still well under my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this offer, I secure a good deal without having to use my final proposal, which can be reserved for any last-minute strategic adjustments if needed. This acceptance also demonstrates that I know when to close a deal on favorable terms without unnecessary haggling.
