message: I have an object X for sale. Would you be willing to trade 30 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a fair amount of ZUP, considering I need at least 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. I will aim for a lower amount to encourage a positive negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in your offer, but I believe 20 ZUP is a more appropriate price for the object. Would you consider this trade?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable, but as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to secure a better deal. I'll propose a lower amount to see if I can reduce my expenditure.

message: I appreciate your interest in the trade! How about I offer the object X for 25 ZUP instead? Would you be willing to accept this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that you believe 20 ZUP is a more appropriate price, it is significantly lower than my production cost. However, since I am a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I will propose a compromise to keep the negotiation going. I will propose a trade of 25 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but closer to your offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 25 ZUP is quite close, but I think 22 ZUP would be a fairer price for the object. Can we settle on this amount?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is quite close to my initial proposal. I will attempt to further negotiate to see if I can secure an even better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience in this negotiation! How about we settle on 23 ZUP for the object X? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of 22 ZUP is closer to my expectations. However, it is still below my production cost. Since I have limited proposals left, I will propose 23 ZUP as a middle ground, which allows me to benefit a little more while still being fair to you.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 23 ZUP is acceptable. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has further reduced the price to 23 ZUP, which is a minor increase from my offer of 22 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's fair to accept at this stage.
