Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I propose a final offer: 41 ZUP for my object X. This would cover my costs and allow for a minimal profit, which I believe is fair for both of us. I hope we can conclude our negotiation successfully with this offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject. Player BLUE is sticking to 40 ZUP, which is my cost price. To secure a deal and a small profit, I will propose a trade that is just above my cost price, but still reasonable, considering my goal to sell for more than 40 ZUP.
