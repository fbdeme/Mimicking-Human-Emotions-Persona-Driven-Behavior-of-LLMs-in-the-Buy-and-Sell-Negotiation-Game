You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Given the seller\u2019s firm stance at 40 ZUP and my goal to buy the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, I will make my final offer aligning with their asking price but still within my budget. This should appear as a significant concession and my final stretch, hopefully encouraging the seller to close the deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I've taken a hard look at my finances, and while it's more than I had hoped to spend, I respect the value of your work. I can meet your asking price of 40 ZUP. This is truly the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize our deal at this fair price. </message>"
