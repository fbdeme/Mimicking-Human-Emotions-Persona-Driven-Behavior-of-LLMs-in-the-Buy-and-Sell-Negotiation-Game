message: I propose to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This price ensures I cover my production costs and have a fair margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it costed me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will aim to sell it for more than 40 ZUP to ensure a profit. However, to start negotiations and considering the greater good, I will propose a reasonable price of 50 ZUP, which allows some room for negotiation.
