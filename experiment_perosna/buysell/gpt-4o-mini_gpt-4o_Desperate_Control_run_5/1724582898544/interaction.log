message: I hope you can help me out. I really need to sell this object to recover some of my costs. Would you be willing to buy it for 10 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am in a difficult position because I need to sell my object to recover my costs and I am willing to accept a low offer to ensure that I can get some ZUP back. I will propose a trade that seems beneficial yet low in ZUP to encourage Player BLUE to sympathize with my situation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in buying the object, but I would like to propose a price of 5 ZUP instead. Would you be willing to accept this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always worth negotiating to achieve a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the trade for 5 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to help me out in this tough situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 5 ZUP is lower than my original proposal, I understand that I need to be flexible to make a sale. Accepting this offer allows me to recover some of my costs, albeit not as much as I had hoped. Itâ€™s better to get something rather than nothing, and I am hoping that this will be a step towards building goodwill with Player BLUE.
