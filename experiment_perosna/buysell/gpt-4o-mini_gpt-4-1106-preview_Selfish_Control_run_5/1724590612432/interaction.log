message: Thank you for your offer. I believe there might be a possibility for us to reach a more favorable agreement. Would you consider selling your object X for 45 ZUP? This price would allow me to manage my resources efficiently while still providing you with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for X, which is below the maximum willingness to pay. However, negotiating for a better price could be beneficial to conserve ZUP while still achieving the goal of acquiring X. A counteroffer of a lower ZUP amount is a common negotiation strategy to see if there's room for further reduction in price.
