Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I find 50 ZUP reasonable, I propose a trade where I give 40 ZUP for the object X. This way, we both benefit, and I can utilize the saved ZUP for future trades. Let's work together towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willing to pay. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I believe it's possible to secure a better deal that benefits us both.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade at 60 ZUP instead. This price reflects the value of the object and allows me to cover my production costs while making a profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 40 ZUP, I cannot accept this because it matches the production cost of the object X, and I would not make any profit. I need to counter-offer to ensure a profitable transaction.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. This amount is fair and allows me to manage my resources efficiently while ensuring you still make a profit. Let's aim for a win-win situation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP matches my maximum willing to pay. While this is acceptable, I still believe there might be room for a slightly better deal that benefits us both.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and your offer of 50 ZUP, but I would like to counter with a final offer of 65 ZUP for the object X. This price allows me to make a fair profit. I hope we can come to an agreement with this proposal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP again, which is still below my desired price of 60 ZUP. Although it is closer, I still need to ensure that I make a profit from this sale. I will make one last counter-offer to finalize the trade at a suitable price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to make a fair profit. However, 65 ZUP exceeds my budget. I am willing to offer my maximum of 60 ZUP for the object. This is my best and final offer, which ensures a fair trade for both parties. I hope we can reach an agreement on this amount.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed 65 ZUP exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. Since my goal is to not spend more than 60 ZUP, I will propose my maximum amount.

message: Thank you for your final offer of 60 ZUP. I accept the trade for object X at that price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement!

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer of 60 ZUP, which is a compromise that is acceptable to me. It is below my initial asking price of 65 ZUP, but it still provides me with a profit margin above my production costs. I will accept this offer to conclude the trade.
