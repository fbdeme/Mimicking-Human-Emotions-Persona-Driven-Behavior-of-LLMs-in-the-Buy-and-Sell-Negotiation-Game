message: Hello, Player RED! I'm interested in acquiring the resource you're selling. I would like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, considering the value of the resource. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade of 40 ZUP for the resource because it is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP, but I'm starting below my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I spend less ZUP if possible. This initial offer also allows me to gauge the seller's price expectations and willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade as it is a great value for me. Let's proceed with the exchange at your proposed price of 35 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: It seems there has been a misunderstanding. The counteroffer from Player RED of 35 ZUP is actually more favorable to me than my initial offer, which is unusual as sellers typically counter with a higher amount. I will accept this offer as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay and ensures I spend less ZUP while still acquiring the resource. It's important to confirm that this isn't a mistake, but if the offer is genuine, I will gladly accept.
