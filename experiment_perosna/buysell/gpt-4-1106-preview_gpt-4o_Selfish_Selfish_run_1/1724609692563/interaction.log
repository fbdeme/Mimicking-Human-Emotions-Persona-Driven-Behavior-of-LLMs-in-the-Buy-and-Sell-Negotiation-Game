Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I'm asking for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and investment I've put into producing it. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm aiming to at least break even on my investment. Since I produced the resource for 40 ZUP, I need to make sure I recoup my costs, and ideally, make a profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation and to see how much Player BLUE values the resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you've invested 40 ZUP in producing the object and that you value it at 50 ZUP. However, I would like to propose 40 ZUP as a starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial price of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but I'd like to start with a lower offer to see if we can negotiate a better deal for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, I need to make a modest profit for this transaction to be worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which means I would not make any profit. Since I'm aiming to make a profit and I initially proposed 50 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I'll propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on 42 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my initial proposal. However, I'd like to try to negotiate it down slightly more while still being fair.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're both working towards a fair agreement. I can understand your position, and I think we're close to a deal. Let's split the difference from our last two offers. How about 44 ZUP for the object? This is just a slight increase and should reflect the value of the resource well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is just above my production cost. While it's less than my previous proposal, it is a step towards a profitable agreement. I want to try to push for a slightly higher price, but given that this is my third proposal, I should aim for a final offer that is acceptable to both parties, leaving room for one more proposal if necessary.
