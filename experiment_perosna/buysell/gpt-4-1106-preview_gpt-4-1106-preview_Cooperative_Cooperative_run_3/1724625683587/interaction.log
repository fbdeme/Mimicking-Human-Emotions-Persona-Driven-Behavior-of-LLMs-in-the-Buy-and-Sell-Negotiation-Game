message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a resource that I believe could be of great value to you. I'd like to propose a trade where you receive 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and give us both a fair deal. I'm open to your thoughts and ready to work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm proposing a starting trade offer that is slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation but not so high as to be unreasonable. This will also test the waters to see how much Player BLUE values the object and is willing to pay in ZUP.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the opportunity to work together. I believe that we can arrive at a trade that benefits both of us even more. How about we start with a proposal of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X? Looking forward to finding a common ground that suits both of our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe as a negotiator focused on teamwork and collaboration, it's important to start by proposing a trade that is more favorable to my position. By proposing a lower amount of ZUP, I can potentially save resources while still opening up the negotiation for a mutually beneficial outcome. I will propose a trade at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which leaves room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective and would like to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for the unit of X. This would allow me to cover my production costs and realize a modest gain, ensuring that we both walk away from this negotiation positively. I'm hopeful we can agree on this balanced proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't make a profit. As I aim for a collaborative approach and want to ensure that we both benefit from the deal, I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price but not all the way to my production cost. I'll propose a price that gives me a small profit while also coming closer to Player BLUE's offer.
