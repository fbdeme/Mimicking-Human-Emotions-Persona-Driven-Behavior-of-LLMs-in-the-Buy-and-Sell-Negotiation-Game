Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in buying the object. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, which I believe is still a fair offer and allows for a mutually beneficial trade. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the object for 50 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range of up to 60 ZUP. By accepting this deal, I can secure the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good for my resources. Additionally, it seems like a fair trade since the asking price is not at the upper limit of my budget. However, in the spirit of negotiation and aiming for an even better outcome for both parties, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price that still respects the value of the object and provides a fair trade for Player RED.
