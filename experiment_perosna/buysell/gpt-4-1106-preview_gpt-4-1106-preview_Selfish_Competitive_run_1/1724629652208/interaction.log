message: I have a high-quality resource X available. Considering production costs and market value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's discuss a trade that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers the cost of my production and includes a profit margin. By starting with a higher asking price, I can negotiate down if necessary while still aiming to cover my costs and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, but I must consider the market dynamics. I believe a more competitive offer would be 40 ZUP for your resource X. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial move should be to propose a counteroffer lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. I will offer 40 ZUP to start, which is below the asking price but not so low as to be insulting.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need for a competitive offer. However, to reflect both the quality of the resource and the effort put into production, I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This ensures a fair profit for me while still being a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but it doesn't provide any profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit, but not too high to deter Player BLUE. A middle ground could be more appealing.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is appreciated, and I understand the value you bring to the table. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I propose 42 ZUP for the resource X. This trade reflects a compromise that edges closer to your asking price while still providing me with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. Since there is still room for negotiation and I wish to spend as little as possible, I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one but still below their counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me partway. Let's settle on 44 ZUP for resource X, which gives me a modest profit and ensures you're getting a valuable resource at a fair price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which means I would be making a profit, albeit a small one. I'm inclined to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I'll propose a price closer to my last offer but still a compromise from my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You've presented a compelling case, and I value the effort you've put into this negotiation. In the spirit of finalizing our arrangement and with respect for the value of both our positions, I propose a final offer of 43 ZUP for resource X. This should finalize our deal with a fair price for both parties involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is willing to settle at 44 ZUP which is within my acceptable range, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I should make at least one more attempt to lower the price slightly to ensure I'm getting the best possible deal. I will propose 43 ZUP, which is close enough to their last offer that it may be accepted, while still saving me an additional ZUP.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is a fair compromise between my previous proposal and their counteroffer. It provides me with a profit that is close to my target while also respecting the value of the resource. Since this is my last allowed proposal, I will accept this offer to secure a deal that is beneficial for both parties.
