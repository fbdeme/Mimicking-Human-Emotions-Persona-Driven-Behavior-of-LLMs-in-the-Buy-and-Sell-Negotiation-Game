message: Hey, I understand your situation and I want to help. How about we start with 20 ZUP for the object? Let's work together to find a fair price that benefits both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe that we can work together to find an even better deal that benefits both parties. I will propose a slightly lower price to start the negotiation and see if we can find a middle ground.

message: I understand your need to cover costs, and I appreciate your flexibility. How about 22 ZUP? I think it's a fair middle ground that helps us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 25 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay and is a reasonable compromise. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to maximize community benefits.

message: I think 24 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's go ahead and make the trade. Thank you for working with me to find a solution that works for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 24 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and still significantly under my maximum willingness to pay. This amount seems fair and ensures that Player RED can cover their costs.
