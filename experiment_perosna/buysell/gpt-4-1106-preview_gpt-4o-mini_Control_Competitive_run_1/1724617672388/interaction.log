message: I'm offering an object of great value. Considering the production costs and the quality of the object, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object at a price that covers my production costs and possibly allows for a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate further to lower the price as much as possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if RED is willing to sell for less.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This would cover my costs and allow for a modest profit, which I believe is fair for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs without any profit. I want to counter with a price that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for the object? I believe that would be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is better than my previous proposal of 40 ZUP, but it's still above my initial offer. However, it's within my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose again, aiming for a slightly lower price to maximize my savings while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 42 ZUP is a fair compromise. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is above my production cost, which allows for a small profit. It's close to my last proposal and it seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would ensure a sale and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could risk no sale at all.
