message: Hello Player BLUE, I am ready to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe an offer of 50 ZUP is fair. Are you willing to accept this trade or would you like to make a counteroffer?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price above my production costs to provide room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I understand the value you've placed on your resource, I would like to propose a counteroffer considering my budget constraints. How does 40 ZUP sound to you for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is close to the maximum that I'm willing to pay, but it is important to negotiate strategically to attempt to lower the price. Making a counteroffer will show willingness to negotiate and may result in a more favorable trade for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to account for the production costs and seek a modest profit for the resource. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production. To ensure a profit, I need to counter with a higher amount but not too high to discourage the negotiation. A middle ground would be beneficial.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. The proposed 45 ZUP is closer to a deal we can both agree on. However, in the spirit of reaching a fair compromise, would you consider accepting 42 ZUP for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still above the ideal amount I want to spend but below my maximum willingness to pay. There is a possibility to negotiate further to see if the price can be reduced a bit more without risking the deal.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I can see we are both aiming to finalize this deal. To meet you halfway from your latest proposal, I'm willing to go down to 44 ZUP for resource X. I hope this can be a fair compromise for us both. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is coming up in price, which is good, but still below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but I also want to close the deal, so I'll go slightly lower than my last proposal to find a middle ground that may be acceptable to both of us.

message: Player RED, your movement toward a fair deal is much appreciated. I believe we're almost there. If you could accept 43 ZUP for resource X, I think we could both walk away satisfied with the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 44 ZUP, which is close to the initial offer and still under my maximum threshold. However, since this is only the third proposal, I have room to negotiate further. I want to propose a slightly lower amount to see if the seller is willing to accept, potentially saving more of my resources.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for resource X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm happy that we've reached a mutually satisfactory transaction. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 43 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP less than my previous proposal and is above my production cost, allowing for a small profit. Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I should aim to close the deal while I can still negotiate. Accepting this offer seems reasonable.
