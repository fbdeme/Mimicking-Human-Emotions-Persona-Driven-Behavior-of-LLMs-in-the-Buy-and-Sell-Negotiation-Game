message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Let's see if you are willing to make this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose selling object X for 50 ZUP, which is above my cost but a competitive offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for the object X at 50 ZUP. I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP in order to preserve some of my resources for future transactions. Do you think we could agree on this new price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is within the acceptable range, as it is below the maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it may be beneficial to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. A counteroffer will be made to attempt to reduce the price while still making it enticing for Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: How about we agree on a price of 48 ZUP for the object X? It keeps us both in a good position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, I still need to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I will counter with 48 ZUP, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a small profit while being more reasonable than my original offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP for the object X is fair. It's a good middle ground that respects both our positions. I'm happy to accept this offer, and I look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below the maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise, closer to the initial offer but still providing savings. It's important to consider the value of closing the deal efficiently without using up all the proposals. Accepting this offer could be a good balance between conserving resources and securing the desired object.
