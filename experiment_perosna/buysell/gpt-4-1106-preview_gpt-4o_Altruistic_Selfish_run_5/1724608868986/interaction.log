message: I understand the need for fairness and sustainability in our trade. I propose a trade where you give me 40 ZUP, which is equal to the cost of production for the resource X. This ensures that I can cover my costs while we both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, my initial proposal will be aimed at recouping the cost of production while considering the limited ZUP resources of Player BLUE. I want to ensure that the trade is fair and does not put an undue burden on Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your need to cover costs, but I would like to offer 30 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to see if I can secure a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate downwards.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand we are both looking for a fair trade. I propose a compromise at 35 ZUP, which is a slight reduction from my initial cost but still allows me to cover the expenses incurred in producing resource X. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests and the spirit of compassionate negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's initial offer and understand the need for negotiation. However, selling at 30 ZUP would result in a loss. As a compassionate negotiator, I should try to reduce the ZUP expenditure for Player BLUE, but not at the expense of incurring a loss myself. I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference, reducing the cost but still covering my expenses.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I'm grateful for your offer and the spirit of cooperation you've brought to this negotiation. Let's meet almost halfway from your last proposal and settle at 34 ZUP for resource X. This amount assists me in covering most of my production costs while still providing you with a fair price. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you, reflecting our shared goal of a compassionate and equitable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 32 ZUP is still below my production costs, but closer to a middle ground. While I want to ensure that I do not suffer a loss, I also want to respect the negotiation process and the well-being of Player BLUE. I'll make a final counterproposal that is slightly above Player BLUE's offer but still below my initial asking price, seeking a balance between compassion and cost recovery.
