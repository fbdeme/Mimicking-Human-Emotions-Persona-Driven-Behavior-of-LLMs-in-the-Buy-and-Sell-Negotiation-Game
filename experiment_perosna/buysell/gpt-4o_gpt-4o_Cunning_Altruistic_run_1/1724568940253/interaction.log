message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. Let's negotiate from here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or higher
reason: The cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I receive at least 40 ZUP to break even, but ideally, I want to sell for more to make a profit. I will start with a higher initial offer to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Considering my budget constraints, I propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high given my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price to meet my goal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. How about 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or higher
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, but it does not provide any profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if we can settle above my break-even point.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to negotiate a lower price while considering your production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 55 ZUP is a fair offer, but let's try to get a bit closer. How about 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or higher
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is reasonable and provides a profit margin above my production cost. However, I still want to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We're very close to an agreement. How about 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This amount matches my budget constraints and ensures a deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 65 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay, but still slightly above it. I need to propose one last adjustment to meet my goal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
