Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your final offer of 50 ZUP is noted, but it does not adequately reflect the value of resource X. However, in the spirit of closing a deal that benefits us both, I can make a concession. My new proposal is 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a generous compromise to finalize our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has decreased their offer, which is a common negotiation tactic to pressure the seller into a lower deal. As a master strategist, I will reject this offer because it is too close to the production cost and does not meet my goal for a profitable margin. I will counter with a price that is above the production cost but still below my previous offer to appear flexible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your final counteroffer of 55 ZUP is still lower than expected for the quality of X. However, in the interest of reaching an agreement and as my final proposal, I am willing to accept 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price takes into account the production cost and provides a modest profit margin, making it a fair and equitable deal for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has slightly increased their offer, but it remains below my desired profit margin.
