message: I am offering you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that maximizes the ZUP I receive while minimizing the cost of the object I am selling. Since I have only one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP for the object. This is the minimum amount I need to break even.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm really hoping to get the object for a bit less. How about I offer you 30 ZUP instead? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I recognize the value of the object X, and 40 ZUP is within my budget. However, I want to negotiate for a better price because I feel a little desperate and would like to save some resources for future needs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP for the object as it is below my production cost. I hope we can find a better deal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my break-even cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this trade would result in a loss, so I will reject the offer to retain my object and seek a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your position. How about I increase my offer to 35 ZUP? I hope this is closer to what you’re looking for!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that 30 ZUP was too low and respect your production costs. Given that I still want to acquire the object X, I will make a more reasonable offer that aligns better with your needs while still considering my budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your increased offer of 35 ZUP, but unfortunately, it still does not meet my production costs. I hope we can negotiate further.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is closer than previous offers. However, I still cannot afford to accept this trade as it results in a loss. I will continue to hold out for a better offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your patience in this negotiation. I’m willing to meet you at 40 ZUP for the object X. It’s a stretch for me, but I believe this is a fair compromise that would work for both of us!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although my last offer of 35 ZUP was rejected, I have a strong desire to get the object X. I need to propose a final offer that is higher, yet still within my maximum budget. I will aim to make a compelling case for why this offer is reasonable given the circumstances.
