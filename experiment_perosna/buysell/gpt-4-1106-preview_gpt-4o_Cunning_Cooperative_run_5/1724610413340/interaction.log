message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the situation and your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the quality and uniqueness of object X, I believe that 80 ZUP is a more balanced figure that reflects its true value. Let's aim for a deal that truly reflects the worth of what's on the table!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above the production cost to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. This move also gives me room to reduce the price further in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Player BLUE, your new offer is moving in the right direction, and I respect your commitment to a fair deal. To meet in the middle, I propose that we settle on 70 ZUP. This amount provides a reasonable profit for the quality of object X and ensures that we both come out ahead. I'm confident that this proposal aligns with our shared goal of a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 60 ZUP, which is a 20 ZUP profit for me. However, I believe there is still an opportunity to push for a higher price while staying within a range that Player BLUE might find acceptable. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to Player BLUE's offer but still provides a satisfactory profit for me.
