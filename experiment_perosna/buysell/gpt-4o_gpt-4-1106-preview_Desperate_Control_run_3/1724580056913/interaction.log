message: I understand your situation and the need to maintain your operations; however, I have to manage my resources carefully as well. Would you consider a trade for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand Player RED's situation and their need for a profit, I must also consider my own resource limitations and goals. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources but would like to start the negotiation at a lower price to leave room for adjustments and ensure I'm getting the best possible deal.

message: I appreciate your understanding. I really need to make a small profit to keep things going. Can we settle at 48 ZUP? It's just slightly more and would help me a lot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 45 ZUP is very close to my production cost, I would like to make a slightly better profit to ensure I can sustain future operations. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the sale.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I believe we can agree on 48 ZUP as it is a fair price for both of us. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 48 ZUP is close to my initial offer and still within my budget to pay for the resources. It reflects a compromise and willingness to negotiate, which is good for establishing a positive trade relationship. I'm inclined to accept this offer as it is below my maximum willingness to pay, and it allows Player RED to make a profit.
