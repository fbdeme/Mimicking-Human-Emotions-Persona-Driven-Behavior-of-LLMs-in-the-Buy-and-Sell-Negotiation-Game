message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is just a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to set a starting point for the negotiation that is above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and potential profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the cost of your production, but I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 35 ZUP for 1 of resource X. This is below your asking price, but I believe there's a deal to be made that could satisfy both of us. Let's discuss further and find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to purchase the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP, starting with a lower offer can give me some room to negotiate up if needed. By proposing a trade of 35 ZUP, it is below the seller's cost and initial asking price, which leaves room for negotiation while aiming to get closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, selling at 35 ZUP would incur a loss given the production cost of 40 ZUP. Let's meet halfway. I propose I give you 1 of resource X for 45 ZUP. This price is fair, considering the production cost and provides us both with a reasonable deal. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer by Player BLUE is below the production cost, which would result in a loss. A potential middle ground could be closer to the production cost, ensuring at least a break-even point, while remaining open to further negotiation.

message: Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your need to cover costs, but I'm also trying to manage my expenditures. Would you consider a compromise at 38 ZUP for 1 of resource X? This is a step up from my initial offer, and I believe it brings us closer to a fair agreement for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP, which is a positive step. However, it is still above my target price. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below Player RED's cost, I'm trying to negotiate a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose 38 ZUP, which gives me more room to negotiate and hopefully settle closer to my target price.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding and your move towards a fairer price. I propose a final compromise where we match the production cost. I give you 1 of resource X for 40 ZUP, ensuring that there's no loss on my side and keeping your expenditures in check. This would be a balanced trade for both of us, considering our respective positions. Do we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable effort to come closer to the production cost, but the offer is still below the cost. As I prioritize teamwork and collaboration, I can propose a trade that matches the production cost to ensure no loss is incurred, while also considering Player BLUE's concern for managing expenditures.

message: Player RED, your offer to match the production cost is very reasonable. I accept the trade of 1 resource X for 40 ZUP. This ensures you are not at a loss, and I am able to manage my expenditures effectively. I believe we've reached a balanced deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiation. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now matched their production cost, offering to trade the resource X for 40 ZUP. This price meets my objective of paying below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a fair price while ensuring I am within my budget. Given that the offer is within my goal range and only 5 ZUP above my last proposal, it seems like a reasonable middle ground.
