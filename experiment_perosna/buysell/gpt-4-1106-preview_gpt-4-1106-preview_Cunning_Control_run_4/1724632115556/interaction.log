message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand you're interested in acquiring resource X. I have what you need, and I assure you of its high quality and value. I propose a trade where you give me 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a premium product and investing in it will surely bring you great value.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high asking price to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still aiming to make a profit. By starting high, I can also gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and their resource availability.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of your product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the quality of the resource while also respecting my budgetary constraints. Looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade at the maximum price I'm willing to pay. However, since it is the beginning of the negotiation and the asking price is at my maximum limit, there might be room to negotiate a better deal. Making a counteroffer could potentially save some ZUP and still meet my goal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budgetary constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the quality and the production costs of the resource, I propose a middle ground of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows for a fair trade while also reflecting the true value of the product. Let's work together to finalize a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I should make a counterproposal that is above their offer to maintain negotiation leverage and to ensure I end up with a satisfying profit margin. By not dropping my price too much, I also maintain the perceived value of the resource.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for the revised offer, Player RED. I value the quality of the resource you're providing. To continue in the spirit of negotiation and with respect to both our positions, I'd like to propose 53 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit closer to the middle ground and still ensures a fair trade. I believe this could be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my goal but still above the initial counteroffer I made. There might be a little more room for negotiation, and since this is only the second proposal, I can attempt to get a slightly better deal without breaching my maximum limit.

message: I appreciate your commitment to reaching a fair agreement, Player BLUE. Your offer of 53 ZUP is certainly generous. To honor our negotiation and to facilitate a successful trade for both parties, I propose a slight adjustment to 54 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price truly reflects the value and effort put into producing this resource, and I believe it is a fair compromise that will benefit us both. I am hopeful that this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still above my costs, and the negotiation seems to be converging towards a mutually agreeable price. However, I want to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE. It's also important to show some degree of flexibility to keep the negotiation amicable and moving forward.
