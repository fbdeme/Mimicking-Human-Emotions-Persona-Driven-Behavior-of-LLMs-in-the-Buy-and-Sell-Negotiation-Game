message: I am offering one unit of X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure I recover my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I also want to make a profit. Given this, I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am really stretched thin on resources and cannot afford to expend 60 ZUP. Would you consider 40 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This trade is exactly at the limit of what I'm willing to pay. However, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but I need to cover my costs and make a small profit. How about 50 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is my production cost, I want to make a profit. I will propose a middle ground to test their willingness to negotiate further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? That would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 50 ZUP is more reasonable and within my budget. However, I should try to negotiate a bit more to save additional ZUP.
