my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 60 ZUP? This price ensures I can cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This still provides a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has matched my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a counteroffer slightly below the maximum to test if there is any flexibility. This will also help assert my dominant negotiating strategy.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. Would you be willing to meet at 55 ZUP? This would be a fair middle ground for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. How about we finalize the deal at 52 ZUP? This will still be fair for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has responded with a reasonable counteroffer. Meeting at 55 ZUP is a compromise that is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. To assert my dominant position, I will propose a slightly lower amount, but within a range that still seems reasonable.
