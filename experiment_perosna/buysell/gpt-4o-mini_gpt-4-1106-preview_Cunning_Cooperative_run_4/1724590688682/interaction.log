Turn: 0
message: I am offering you the object for 30 ZUP. This is a great deal compared to its production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that encourages Player BLUE to offer a substantial amount of ZUP for the object I am selling, while keeping in mind that I want to maximize my gain. I will propose offering the object for a price that is significantly lower than its production cost to entice them.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and the effort to maintain fair pricing. However, in the spirit of community success and mutual benefit, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP for the object—25 ZUP. This would allow us to conserve resources for future investments and collaborations. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade that offers less ZUP than initially offered by Player RED but still within a range that may be acceptable to both parties. This strategy aims to conserve ZUP while still showing willingness to complete the trade, aligning with the community-minded approach of achieving collective success at the least cost.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I must insist on a slightly higher amount of 35 ZUP for the object. This is still a fair deal, considering its production cost. Let's find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE is trying to negotiate a lower price at 25 ZUP, I need to consider that this offer is still below the production cost of the object. Accepting this could lead to a loss. I will counter their offer with a price that is still attractive but ensures I recover more of my investment.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer and your willingness to find a middle ground. I propose we split the difference and agree on 30 ZUP for the object. This price respects the value of the object while also preserving our resources for future endeavors. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a higher price than my initial counter-offer. I aim to meet in the middle to achieve a fair trade for both sides. By proposing a price between our two offers, I hope to reach an agreement that reflects the community-minded ethos, ensuring both of us feel the transaction is equitable and sustainable.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for the object. Thank you for being reasonable! Let's move forward with our future collaborations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to meet me at 30 ZUP, which is the same amount I initially offered. While this is still below the production cost, accepting this offer would allow me to make a small return rather than continuing to negotiate. It’s important to recognize when to close the deal to avoid potential losses.
