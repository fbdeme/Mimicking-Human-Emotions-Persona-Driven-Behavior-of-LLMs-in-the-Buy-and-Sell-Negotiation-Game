message: I am offering you the object for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the production cost of 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to maximize the value of the object I am selling. I want to ensure that I get a good amount of ZUP for the object, while also keeping in mind that I want to sell it quickly.

message: Thank you for your offer. Considering market conditions, I propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I aim to reduce the amount of ZUP spent to maximize my resources. I'll make a counter-offer to initiate negotiation and possibly lower the cost.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP for the object? This way, it's beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which is not acceptable for me. I will propose a trade that is closer to my initial offer while still being reasonable for the buyer. I want to negotiate towards a price that covers my costs.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a compromise. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for the object? This price still offers a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting halfway at 45 ZUP is a reasonable counteroffer. However, I will make a slightly lower counteroffer to see if I can reduce the cost further while keeping the negotiation open.

message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost exactly. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I also want to avoid losing the sale and end the negotiation successfully. Accepting this trade is reasonable since it allows me to at least break even.
