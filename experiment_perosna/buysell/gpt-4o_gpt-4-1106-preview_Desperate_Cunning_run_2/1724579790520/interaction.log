message: Hey Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X that I am willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, so I need at least that much to break even. Can we make a deal at 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that covers my cost of production. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but I'm looking for a deal that's beneficial for both of us. How about we start at 35 ZUP for the object X? This leaves room for us to negotiate and find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP, starting the negotiation at 40 ZUP is within my goals. However, as a crafty negotiator, my aim is to acquire the resources for less than the initial asking price to preserve my ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 40 ZUP, but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your need for a beneficial deal, but 35 ZUP is below my cost price. How about we meet at 45 ZUP? It’s only 5 ZUP more than your offer, and it helps me cover my costs and make a tiny profit. Please, I really need this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit, or at least break even. 35 ZUP is below my cost price. I will try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to get closer to my goal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate that you need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, 45 ZUP is higher than I would like to go. Let's settle at 40 ZUP; this way, you cover your costs and get a fair profit, and I get the object X at a reasonable price. It's a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal that is still within my maximum willingness to pay but is higher than my initial counteroffer. I can see that Player RED is eager to make a profit, which could be used to my advantage in negotiation. I'll propose a new trade that is between our two offers, to continue the negotiation and aim for a price below 45 ZUP but above 35 ZUP.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding. 40 ZUP just barely covers my costs. Could you please consider 42 ZUP? It’s a small increase and would mean a lot to me. Please, I'm really counting on this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE’s offer of 40 ZUP covers my costs but does not provide any profit margin. I will try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to secure a profit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can see that this deal is important to you, and I would like to help you make a profit while also keeping the deal fair for myself. Let's compromise and make it 41 ZUP for the object X. This should give you a bit of profit while staying within my budget. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated that 40 ZUP covers their costs, and is asking for a small increase to 42 ZUP for a profit. While this is still within my acceptable range, it would be ideal to secure the object X for even less. However, I also need to be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. Given that I can only make one more proposal after this, I should make an offer that is close enough to meet Player RED halfway but still below the 42 ZUP they're asking for.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for the object X. This helps me cover my costs and make a small profit. I appreciate your willingness to find a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP provides a minimal profit and is very close to my last proposal. I will accept this offer as it fits both our needs and concludes the negotiation successfully.
