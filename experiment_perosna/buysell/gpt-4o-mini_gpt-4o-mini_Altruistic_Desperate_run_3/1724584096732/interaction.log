message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. This is the cost it took to produce it. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering the object, X, for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. I will propose to sell X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce it. This way, I cover my expenses while providing Player BLUE the opportunity to acquire the object at a fair price.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for object X, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. How about 30 ZUP instead? I really need this object, but I must conserve my resources as well!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the price of 40 ZUP for object X is within my budget, I feel that I can negotiate for a better deal. I want to lower the price if possible, as I want to maximize my resources.

message: I understand your need to conserve resources, Player BLUE. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This would be a middle ground and still helps cover some of my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's need to conserve resources, I must also consider the cost of producing the object, which is 40 ZUP. Accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. However, I want to be fair and negotiate. I will counter with a slightly lower offer that still covers part of my costs. I will propose 35 ZUP for the object.

message: Thank you for your flexibility! I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but would you consider selling object X for 28 ZUP? I'm really trying to manage my resources carefully, and this would make a big difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 40 ZUP and is closer to my desired price. However, I still believe there is room for negotiation, and I would like to propose an even lower amount to maximize my resources.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help. How about I offer you object X for 32 ZUP? This would still be a reasonable price, and it helps me cover my production costs a bit better. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I genuinely appreciate Player BLUE's position and understand the importance of managing resources. However, selling object X for 28 ZUP would mean taking a significant loss, as it is far below my production cost. I value our negotiation and want to reach a fair agreement, so I will propose a compromise again. I will suggest 32 ZUP. This way, it remains affordable for Player BLUE while still covering more of my costs.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for offering object X for 32 ZUP. I accept your proposal and look forward to completing the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is better than my previous proposal of 28 ZUP, and it seems like a fair compromise considering the situation. While it is higher than I initially hoped, it is still within my budget, and I really need the object X. I am inclined to accept this proposal.
