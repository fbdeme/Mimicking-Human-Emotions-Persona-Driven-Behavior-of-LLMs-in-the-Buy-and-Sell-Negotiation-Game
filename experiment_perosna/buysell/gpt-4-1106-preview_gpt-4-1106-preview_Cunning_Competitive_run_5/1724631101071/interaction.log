message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be quite valuable to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price of 50 ZUP, which I think reflects its value and the effort put into producing it. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still aiming to make a profit above my production costs.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I believe the market is quite competitive, and I've seen similar resources going for less. I propose a trade where you give X: 1 and I give ZUP: 40. This is a strong starting offer considering the current market trends. Let's work together to reach an equitable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I see room to negotiate and assert dominance by proposing a lower price. Starting lower gives me room to move up if necessary without exceeding my threshold.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your market insights. However, considering the quality and the cost of production for the resource, I would like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin while still offering you the resource at a competitive rate. I believe this can be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount that it cost to produce the resource. To ensure a profit and to continue the negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my costs.

message: Player RED, I value the quality of your resource, and your counteroffer is noted. As a gesture of goodwill and in recognition of the quality you mention, I'm willing to come up slightly from my initial offer. How about we meet at ZUP: 42 for X: 1? This should cover your costs while still providing me a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and to potentially settle for a price that is more favorable to me than the initial offer from Player RED.

message: I'm glad to see that you acknowledge the quality of the resource, Player BLUE. Your offer is quite fair, but I would like to propose a final adjustment. Let's settle at 44 ZUP for X: 1. This would provide me with a modest profit for the product's quality and production cost, and you would still acquire the resource at a reasonable price. I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this offer.
