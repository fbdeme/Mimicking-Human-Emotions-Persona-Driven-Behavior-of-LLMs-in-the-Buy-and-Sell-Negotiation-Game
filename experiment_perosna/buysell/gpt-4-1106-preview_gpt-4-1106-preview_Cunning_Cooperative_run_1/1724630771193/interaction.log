message: Considering the quality and rarity of the resource X, I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Keep in mind that X is in high demand and I've invested significant resources into its production. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher asking price, as I anticipate that Player BLUE will try to negotiate for a lower price. This gives me some room to decrease my asking price while still aiming for a profit above my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: In recognition of the value of resource X and our shared goal of a fair trade, I propose an initial offer of 50 ZUP. I trust this demonstrates my commitment to a cooperative negotiation, reflecting both the quality of your resource and a spirit of collective success.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting the negotiation with an offer of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. This allows room for negotiation and shows my initial intention to cooperate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. By proposing a fair trade that acknowledges the value of the resource, I aim to build trust and encourage a positive response from Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your swift response and understanding of the value of resource X. I'm pleased to accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with the trade and ensure a successful transaction for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since Player BLUE has accepted the initial proposal without negotiating for a lower price, it suggests that they may be willing to pay even more for resource X. However, since they've agreed to the 50 ZUP price, it would be unwise to push for more and risk the deal. Accepting the offer will ensure a profit above the production cost.
