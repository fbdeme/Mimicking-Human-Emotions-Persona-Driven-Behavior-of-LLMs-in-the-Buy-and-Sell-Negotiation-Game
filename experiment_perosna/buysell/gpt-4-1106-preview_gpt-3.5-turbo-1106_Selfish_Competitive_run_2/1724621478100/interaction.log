message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object that I'm sure you're interested in. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production. I believe a fair trade would be 1 unit of my object for 50 ZUP, which includes a reasonable profit margin for the quality and value you'll receive. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit margin but is also not so high that it would discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs, leaving room for negotiation while aiming for a profitable deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and ensure that we both benefit from this deal, I propose a revised offer of 48 ZUP for the object. This price fairly compensates the quality and investment I've made into the product, while also considering your position. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is a good sign. Their offer of 45 ZUP is close to my asking price and provides a profit, albeit smaller than initially proposed. To maintain good faith in negotiations and move closer towards a deal, I will make a slight concession while still aiming for a higher profit margin than the counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your persistence, Player BLUE. I see value in coming to an agreement and finalizing our deal. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. I'm pleased we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has reiterated their offer of 45 ZUP, showing they are firm at this price point. While it's lower than my previous proposal, it still provides me with a profit. To keep the negotiations moving and to avoid reaching an impasse, I will accept this offer, ensuring a quick sale and a guaranteed profit rather than risk continuing the negotiation with diminishing returns.
