message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I have a high-quality resource X available for your projects. Understanding the market, I'm sure you'll find this offer more than reasonable for the value it provides. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start by setting a high price for the resource, knowing that it may be negotiated down. This will give me leeway to still secure a profit over my production cost without revealing my actual cost or desperation to sell.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, given the exceptional quality and the demand for resource X, I propose a more balanced trade of 80 ZUP. This price reflects the true market value while still giving you a fair deal. I'm sure you will find the benefits of acquiring resource X to be worth the investment.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that meets my production costs but does not provide a significant profit. As a strategist, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still well above my production cost to maintain the upper hand and encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer.
