message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. I would like to propose a slightly reduced price of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which allows me to manage my resources effectively while still providing you with a fair compensation for your product. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations and we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade that respects my goals and looks out for the well-being of both parties. The initial offer made by Player RED is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay. However, considering I am a compassionate negotiator, I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP while still offering a fair price to Player RED.

message: Hi Player RED, I am pleased with your counteroffer of 58 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe that it represents a fair compromise and is within my budget. I accept this offer, and I look forward to finalizing our trade. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counteroffer. The proposed 58 ZUP is still within my budget and meets the goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. This counteroffer seems to be a fair compromise, and accepting it would ensure a balanced deal for both parties, in line with my compassionate negotiation style.
