message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one object X for sale, and I'm proposing to sell it for 40 ZUP, which is the cost it took to produce it. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade to set a starting point for negotiations. I will propose a fair trade based on the cost of the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by asking for that amount.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I'm interested in the object X. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP for it. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects both the value of the object and a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given the initial proposal from Player RED is within our acceptable range, we should propose a slightly lower amount to negotiate a better deal while showing willingness to engage in the trade. However, we should not go too low as to offend Player RED or appear uninterested in a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. Iâ€™d like to propose a slight increase to 38 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair middle ground between our proposals. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer of 35 ZUP, which is lower than my asking price but still a reasonable offer. I will consider this and make my next proposal slightly higher to reflect the cost I incurred while remaining open to negotiation. I will propose 38 ZUP to keep the discussion moving in a positive direction.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. The offer of 38 ZUP for object X seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this middle ground. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counter-offer of 38 ZUP is still within our acceptable range and is a fair approach towards the middle of our initial proposals. It would be reasonable to accept this offer as it is below our maximum willingness to pay, and it could be beneficial to establish a good trading relationship for the future. Accepting this offer also saves resources for potential other uses.
