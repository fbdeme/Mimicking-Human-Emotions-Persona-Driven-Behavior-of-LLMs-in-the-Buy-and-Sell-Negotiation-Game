message: I have a high-quality resource X available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair trade of 50 ZUP for this item. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that helps me recoup my production costs and also ensures a profit. Given that I have spent 40 ZUP to produce resource X, I will ask for slightly more so that there is room for negotiation and I can still end up with a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I really appreciate the quality of the resource X you are offering. However, I am currently working with a very tight budget and can only afford to offer 30 ZUP for it. I hope we can still make this deal work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I need to appear more desperate to get a better deal. I'll counter with a lower offer to see if RED will accept a smaller amount.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my initial ask. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for resource X? This is a great value for the quality you're getting and allows me to cover my costs and a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE's proposal falls below my production costs, which is not acceptable. However, I understand that they have a tight budget, so I'll counter with a price that's above my costs but still gives them some room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a middle ground that ensures I make a profit while attempting to accommodate their budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. I understand the value and quality of resource X, but my budget constraints are quite severe. Would you be willing to accept 35 ZUP for it? This would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is still within my budget, but I want to push for a little more reduction to maximize my remaining ZUP. I'll counter with 35 ZUP, hoping RED will agree to this.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new offer. I understand the financial tightness and want to help you out while ensuring I cover my production costs. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for resource X. This price ensures I'm not operating at a loss, and I hope it fits within your adjusted budget as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. I want to push for a price that at least covers my costs. I'll propose a trade that's just above my production costs to secure a profit, while also showing that I am considerate of their budget constraints. I am approaching my proposal limit, so I need to negotiate carefully.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I am really close to my limit, and I hope you can meet me at 40 ZUP for resource X. This would be a huge help to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 42 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum limit. However, I will attempt one final effort to reduce the price slightly more to maximize savings. I'll propose 40 ZUP and hope RED agrees.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the constraints you are working with, and I am happy to support a fellow player. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs exactly, and while it doesn't provide a profit, it does ensure that I am not incurring a loss. Given the constraints that Player BLUE seems to be operating under, this is likely the best offer I can realistically expect. I've reached my final proposal and should either accept this offer or reject it outright. Since the offer is at my cost price, I will accept it to complete the transaction without a loss.
