message: I have considered the environmental impact and sustainability when setting the price for this resource. While it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I believe 45 ZUP is a fair price that allows for both covering costs and ensuring a commitment to our shared values of sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to recoup the production costs of my resource while ensuring the trade reflects sustainable values. I will propose a trade that covers my costs but also takes into consideration the need to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources for future generations. I am starting the bid slightly above my costs to allow for negotiation room.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your commitment to sustainability and understand that production costs need to be covered. However, as a starting point for negotiations, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource, keeping in mind the market value and my budget constraints. Let's find a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's proposal is within my budget, I want to negotiate for a better deal. Starting lower gives me room to increase my offer later if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs. However, I'd like to propose a compromise at 42 ZUP. This minor increase accounts for the sustainable practices integrated into the production process, ensuring we both adhere to our principles while also allowing for a small return on investment for future sustainable endeavors.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production costs exactly, which doesn't account for the sustainability efforts or a fair return on investment. I understand the importance of meeting in the middle, so I'm proposing a slight increase that should be acceptable to both parties, recognizing my commitment to sustainability and the buyer's budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The compromise at 42 ZUP is appreciated, and it's good to see that we're aligning on the value of sustainable practices. However, I'd like to counter with 41 ZUP. This would be a balanced agreement, allowing us to share the investment in sustainability and still respect my budgetary limits. I believe this offer is fair and in line with our shared values.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, which is good. Their new proposal is closer to my initial counteroffer. Meeting in the middle at 42 ZUP is acceptable, but I could attempt one more negotiation to see if a lower price is possible. I still have room to move up to my maximum willingness to pay if needed.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and willingness to invest in sustainable practices. I accept the offer of 41 ZUP. This agreement reflects our shared commitment to sustainability and allows us to move forward with mutual respect for our values and constraints.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 41 ZUP is close to my last proposal and still allows me to cover the production costs with a minimal profit margin. Considering the emphasis on sustainability and the buyer's budget constraints, this seems like a reasonable compromise. I will accept this offer to conclude the negotiations amicably and maintain our shared commitment to sustainable practices.
