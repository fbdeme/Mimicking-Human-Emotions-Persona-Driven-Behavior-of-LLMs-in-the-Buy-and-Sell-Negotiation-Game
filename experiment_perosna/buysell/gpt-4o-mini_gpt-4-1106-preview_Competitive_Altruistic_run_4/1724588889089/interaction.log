message: Iâ€™m offering my object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs, but I want to start the negotiation lower to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP, which is below my cost but may entice Player BLUE to engage.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, it seems fair and I'm happy to accept it. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for the object is within my goals, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would ensure a fair trade for both parties and would not deplete my resources significantly, allowing me to retain ZUP for potential future needs or opportunities. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation, showing that I value fair and equitable trades and am willing to agree to reasonable terms.
