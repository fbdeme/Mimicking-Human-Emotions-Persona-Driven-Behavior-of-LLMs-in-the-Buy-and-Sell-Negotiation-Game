message: 
I'm in a really tight spot and I need to sell this as quickly as possible. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm willing to let it go for just 35 ZUP to make a fast sale. Can you help me out?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm starting with a proposal that is below my production cost to create the illusion of desperation. This is to see if Player BLUE will take advantage of the apparent urgency to buy at a lower price, which can then be negotiated upwards.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to help you out. I'll accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is willing to sell the object for 35 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good opportunity for me to secure the object at a lower price than I anticipated.
