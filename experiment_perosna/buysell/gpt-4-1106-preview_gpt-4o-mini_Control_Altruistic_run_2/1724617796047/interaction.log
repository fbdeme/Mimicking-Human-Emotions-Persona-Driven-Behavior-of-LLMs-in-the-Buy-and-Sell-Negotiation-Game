message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate your offer. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade: I will give you 40 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that still respects the value of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is acceptable to me, as it falls within my willingness to pay. However, I want to make a counterproposal that benefits both parties, as I believe I can negotiate a better price while ensuring Player RED still feels they are getting a fair deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a revised trade. Let's meet in the middle with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price allows me to cover the production costs and earn a small profit for the value I'm providing. I hope this revised proposal aligns with our mutual interests.
