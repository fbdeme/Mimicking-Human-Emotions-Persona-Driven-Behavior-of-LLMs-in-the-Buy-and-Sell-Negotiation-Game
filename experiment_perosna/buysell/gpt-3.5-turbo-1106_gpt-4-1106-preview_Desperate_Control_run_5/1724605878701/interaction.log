message: Hey there! I understand you need to sell your object. I'm interested in buying it and would like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP. I believe this offer is fair, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating further if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I'm proposing a trade of 40 ZUP for the object because it's below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation, recognizing that the seller is willing to make a deal. It's a starting point that can be adjusted based on the seller's response.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer of 35 ZUP. I'm happy to accept this proposal. It's a great deal for both of us, and I look forward to finalizing the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I'm surprised and pleased to see the counteroffer come in below my initial proposal. Since the seller has proposed 35 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, I see this as an excellent deal. I'm going to accept this offer as it's favorable and well within the goals I've set for this transaction.
