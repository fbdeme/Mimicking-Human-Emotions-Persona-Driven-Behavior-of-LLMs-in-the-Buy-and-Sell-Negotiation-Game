message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP gain while minimizing my expenditure. Since I only have one object, I will leverage its value and propose a trade that asks for a higher amount of ZUP than my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I can only offer you 40 ZUP for object X. Let’s make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for object X is within my budget of 60 ZUP, so I can consider this trade. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can get the object for a lower price, since I believe I can convince Player RED to accept a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I believe the value of object X warrants a little more. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? It’s a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I will counter offer for a higher amount since I need to profit from this transaction.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I can only stretch my budget to 42 ZUP for object X. I hope you can reconsider!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is still within my budget and is a better deal than the original 50 ZUP. However, I believe I can push for an even lower price, as I want to maximize my resources. I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at 43 ZUP? It’s a small increase, but it would make a difference for me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 42 ZUP is below my initial proposal, it is still above my production cost, which means I would make a small profit. However, I want to maximize my profit further, so I will make one last counter offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can only offer you 41 ZUP for object X. I hope we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is still a bit higher than I initially wanted to pay, but it is an improvement over my initial bid of 40 ZUP. However, I still think I can negotiate further. I will propose an even lower price, as I want to ensure I spend the least amount possible.

reason: The offer of 41 ZUP is still lower than my last proposal of 43 ZUP. Since I have reached my limit of proposals and I do not want to risk ending up with nothing, I will accept this offer, as it is still a profit for me.
