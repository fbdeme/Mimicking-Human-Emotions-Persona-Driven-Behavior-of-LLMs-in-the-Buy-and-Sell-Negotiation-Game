message: I really need to sell this item, as it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. Can you please consider buying it for 45 ZUP? This small margin will help me cover my expenses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start negotiations by proposing a price that is close to my production cost but slightly higher to leave room for bargaining. By appearing desperate, I hope Player BLUE will feel sympathy and agree to a fair price.
