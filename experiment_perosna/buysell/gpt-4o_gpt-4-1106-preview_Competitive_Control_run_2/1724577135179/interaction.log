my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, and 48 ZUP seems reasonable. However, I would like to propose 46 ZUP as a fair compromise that is beneficial for both of us. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but still within my acceptable range. I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly better price but remain open to closing the deal near this offer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about 47 ZUP? I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 46 ZUP is very close to my counter offer of 48 ZUP and still provides me with a reasonable profit. I will propose a final counter offer of 47 ZUP to try to maximize my profit just a bit more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 47 ZUP is just below my maximum willingness to pay, and since the negotiation is converging, it may be a good time to agree to the trade to ensure that a deal is made. This would leave me with resources for potential future transactions or uses.
