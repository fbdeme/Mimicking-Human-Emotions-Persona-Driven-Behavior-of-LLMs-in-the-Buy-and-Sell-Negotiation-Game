message: I understand you're asking for 40 ZUP for the object. While I'm definitely interested, I would like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for the object. It's a competitive offer and would leave us both satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay for the resource. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if I can save some resources and still close the deal.
