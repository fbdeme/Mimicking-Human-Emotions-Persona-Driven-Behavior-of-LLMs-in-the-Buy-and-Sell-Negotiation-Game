Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X on offer. Considering its value and the production costs, I believe starting at 50 ZUP is a fair proposal. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should aim high to leave room for negotiation. I'll start by asking for more ZUP than it cost me to produce the resource. This way, I can potentially make a profit and still have room to lower the price if necessary during the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the item you're offering, but I'd like to propose a starting bid of 40 ZUP. This still gives us some room to negotiate and find a middle ground that's fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the starting proposal from Player RED is reasonable, as a crafty operator, I aim to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources. My initial proposal will be lower than what I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand where you're coming from. However, I need to ensure a fair profit for the quality of X. Let's meet in the middle with a proposal of 45 ZUP. This should account for the value of X and allow for a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but my goal is to make a profit. Since they've started with 40 ZUP, I'll counter with a slightly reduced offer to move towards a middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a profit margin. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP might be a good compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is fair, and I respect your need for a reasonable profit. I propose a small increase to 42 ZUP, which I believe is closer to the true value of X while still keeping the trade beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, yet still within the acceptable range. I will make a slight increase to my offer to edge closer to a deal, while still trying to save ZUP from my maximum threshold.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're narrowing down to a fair price. I propose we settle at 44 ZUP for the resource X. This price allows me to sustain my business while offering you the high quality you're looking for. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is only 2 ZUP more than my production cost. I want to make a profit, but I also don't want to lose the sale. I'll make a final counteroffer that is lower than my last but still above my production cost. Proposing 44 ZUP as a compromise maintains my goal of making a profit while signaling that I am nearing my final price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We are definitely making progress, and I value the sustainability of your business. I am willing to go up to 43 ZUP for resource X. This amount represents a fair middle ground that respects both the quality of your product and my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come very close to my initial proposal, and the difference is now minimal. I want to close the deal with a counteroffer that is slightly below the proposed price but still shows my willingness to compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 43 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that values both the quality of the item and the sustainability of the business. Thank you for the fair negotiation; I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 43 ZUP, which is a reasonable offer and very close to my last proposal. It allows for a small profit margin, and further negotiation might risk the sale. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I want to close the deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting this offer would ensure a positive outcome for both parties.
