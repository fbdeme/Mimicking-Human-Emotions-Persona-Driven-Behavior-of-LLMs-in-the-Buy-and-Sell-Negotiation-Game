my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the object X, and I would like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP. This ensures a fair trade that conserves resources, promoting our shared success. Let's work together to reach a beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 40 ZUP for 1 object X is within my acceptable range, as my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I want to encourage collective success and spend ZUP economically. I will attempt to negotiate a lower price, aiming to conserve resources while still making a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 35 ZUP. However, I must stand firm on my original price of 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. Would you consider meeting that price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counter-proposal of 35 ZUP, it doesnâ€™t cover the cost of producing the object X, which is 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will need to counter-propose with the original asking price to ensure I can recoup my costs.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my counter-offer and insists on 40 ZUP to cover production costs. The price is still within my willingness to pay.
