message: Hi Player BLUE, Iâ€™m offering to sell you my resource for 20 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price and allows us both to benefit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that offers a fair exchange for the resources while minimizing ZUP spending, in line with sustainable practices. Since I have one object to sell, I will propose a trade for a fraction of the ZUP it cost to produce. This way, I can ensure some return while keeping the ZUP expenditure reasonable.
