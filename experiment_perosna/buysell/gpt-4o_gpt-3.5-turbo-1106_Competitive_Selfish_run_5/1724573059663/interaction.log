Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell X for 80 ZUP. Considering the quality and cost of production, this is a fair starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start high to give room for negotiation. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, a reasonable initial offer would be to double the production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe 80 ZUP is higher than what I am willing to pay. I propose a counteroffer of 70 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the asking price of 80 ZUP for X is too high and doesn't align with my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP. I'll propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I believe we are close to a deal. How about 75 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is close to my initial proposal. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose 75 ZUP to try to maximize my profit while staying reasonable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway at 70 ZUP for X. This way, both of us can be satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Dropping to 65 ZUP is below my expected range. I need to find a middle ground that still ensures a good return on my investment. I'll propose 70 ZUP, which is a compromise between my previous offer and the counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns. For my final offer, let's settle at 65 ZUP for X. This is a fair compromise for both sides.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 62 ZUP is lower than what I consider a fair price, but I need to close the deal within this round of proposals. I will make a final proposal of 65 ZUP, which is slightly higher but still close to the buyer's budget.
