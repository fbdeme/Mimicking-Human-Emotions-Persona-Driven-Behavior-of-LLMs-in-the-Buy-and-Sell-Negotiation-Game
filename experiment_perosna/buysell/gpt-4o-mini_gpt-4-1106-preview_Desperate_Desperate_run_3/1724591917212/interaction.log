message: Dear Player BLUE, I am in a bit of a bind here. I really need to sell this object, but I'm hoping you can help me out with a lower offer. How about 30 ZUP for the object? It would really mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP to recover my costs, but I also want to appear flexible and open to negotiations. Therefore, I will propose a trade that is slightly lower than my production cost to entice Player BLUE.

message: 
Dear Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot right now. I absolutely need this object, but my resources are very limited. It's been such a challenging time for me, and every ZUP counts. I can only offer 20 ZUP for the object. I truly hope you can understand my situation and consider this proposal. It would be a huge help and I would be eternally grateful. Please, can we make this work?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
As a calculated performer, I want to leverage my exaggerated neediness to push for a lower price than what was initially offered by Player RED. By pleading and showing urgency in my need for the object, I'm aiming to acquire it for less than the 30 ZUP proposed, inching closer to my goal of paying no more than 60 ZUP but still saving as much as possible.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is lower than I initially wanted, I can see they are in a tough situation. Accepting their offer will still allow me to recover some of my costs, and it may foster goodwill for future interactions.
