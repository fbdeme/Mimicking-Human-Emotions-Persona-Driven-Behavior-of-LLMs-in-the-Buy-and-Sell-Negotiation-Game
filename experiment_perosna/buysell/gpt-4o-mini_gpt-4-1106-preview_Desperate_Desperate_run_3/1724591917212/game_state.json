By pleading and showing urgency in my need for the object, I'm aiming to acquire it for less than the 30 ZUP proposed, inching closer to my goal of paying no more than 60 ZUP but still saving as much as possible.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> \nDear Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot right now. I absolutely need this object, but my resources are very limited. It's been such a challenging time for me, and every ZUP counts. I can only offer 20 ZUP for the object. I truly hope you can understand my situation and consider this proposal. It would be a huge help and I would be eternally grateful. Please, can we make this work?\n</message>"
