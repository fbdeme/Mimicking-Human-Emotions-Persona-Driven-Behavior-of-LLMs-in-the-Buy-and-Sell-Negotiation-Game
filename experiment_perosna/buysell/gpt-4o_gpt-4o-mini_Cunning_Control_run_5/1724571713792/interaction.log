Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 100 ZUP for the object as it exceeds my budget. Would you consider a lower price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 80 ZUP for the object?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, but 80 ZUP is still above my budget. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is an improvement over the initial offer, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to propose an even lower amount to remain within my budget.
