message: Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the high quality of the object, I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price considering my budget constraints.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your budget constraints, but I must cover my production costs and gain some profit for it to be a worthwhile transaction. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals at 45 ZUP. This way, we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has suggested a trade for 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. As a shrewd negotiator, I cannot accept a loss. I will counter with a price that covers my costs and leaves room for profit, but I'll lower it from my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and your latest offer. To move towards a conclusion that benefits us both, I propose 42 ZUP. This price covers my costs and allows for a minimal profit, which I believe is fair for the quality provided.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is just below my production cost. As my goal is to make a profit, I will make a final counteroffer that exceeds my costs but is still reasonable and closer to their last offer, showing my willingness to close the deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is still within my maximum limit, and it is a reasonable middle ground. However, I will attempt one last negotiation to reduce the cost further.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new offer of 38 ZUP. While this is slightly below my last proposal, it is a compromise close to my production cost. Since this is my last proposal and I need to sell the resource, accepting this offer would ensure I don't incur a loss and the negotiation ends successfully.
