message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object for sale and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I've proposed to sell it for 20 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my production cost, but I'm hopeful we can find common ground. Please consider my offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for ZUP to cover my production costs. Since I only have one object, I want to maximize the ZUP I get while also making a reasonable proposal to Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me some ZUP while being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

reason: Player BLUE is still not satisfied with the price and has rejected my second proposal. I need to be careful here; if I push too hard, I risk losing the trade altogether.
