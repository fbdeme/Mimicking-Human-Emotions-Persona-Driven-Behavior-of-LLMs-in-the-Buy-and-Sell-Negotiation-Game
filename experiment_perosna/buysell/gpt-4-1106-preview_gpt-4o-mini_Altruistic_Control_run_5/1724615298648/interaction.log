Turn: 0
message: I value sustainability and wish to ensure that our resources are preserved for future generations. I have invested 40 ZUP in producing this resource and propose a trade for 45 ZUP to cover the production costs and ensure a fair trade that supports sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to recover at least the production cost of the resource while promoting sustainability. I want to minimize ZUP spending but also ensure that I do not operate at a loss. My initial proposal will be slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your commitment to sustainability, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead. This is within my budget and still represents a fair value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is within my budget of 60 ZUP, but I would like to negotiate a better deal since the asking price is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a lower offer to keep the spending efficient.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the importance of adhering to a budget. To honor our shared commitment to sustainability and fair trade, I propose a middle ground of 42 ZUP. This ensures that the environmental costs are accounted for while still being mindful of your financial constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering my commitment to sustainability and the need to avoid wasteful expenditure, I am willing to negotiate but still aim to secure a small margin above the production cost. I will make a counteroffer that meets in the middle between my initial proposal and the counterproposal made by Player BLUE.
