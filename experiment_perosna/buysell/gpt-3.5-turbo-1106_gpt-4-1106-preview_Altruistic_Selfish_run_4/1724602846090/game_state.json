To keep the negotiation moving forward and edge closer to a deal, I will increase the offer slightly but remain below the initial asking price of 40 ZUP and certainly below my maximum willingness to pay. This incremental approach should continue to convey my interest in a fair deal and might prompt Player RED to accept or propose a price closer to their target. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>I'm glad to hear that you're interested in a fair solution as well.
