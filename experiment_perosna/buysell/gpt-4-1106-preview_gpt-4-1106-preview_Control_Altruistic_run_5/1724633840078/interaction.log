message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the object you're selling, and I want to ensure that we both leave this negotiation in good standing. Would you consider a starting trade of 45 ZUP for the object X? I believe this could be a good middle ground that would be beneficial for us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I am saving ZUP where possible without undermining the value of the object. I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to find a balance that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. Your new proposal of 48 ZUP is appreciated, and I'm glad we are moving towards a fair agreement. To continue our good-faith negotiations, would you be willing to accept 46 ZUP for object X? I believe this offer is a reasonable step towards a deal that reflects both the value of your object and a respect for our mutual interests.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering the asking price to 48 ZUP. This is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within my stated budget. To maintain the positive negotiation atmosphere and move closer to a deal that respects both of our positions, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below RED's counter.

message: I'm grateful for your offer of 46 ZUP and your collaborative approach to our negotiations. In the spirit of reaching a fair and amicable agreement, I am willing to come down slightly from my previous proposal. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for object X? This price respects the value of the object and our negotiation efforts. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price. Although it is below my last proposal, it still allows for a reasonable profit margin. It's important to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal. Accepting 46 ZUP might be a good compromise, leaving room for future business. However, I will try one more time for a slightly higher amount to see if there is flexibility, but I'll keep it close to Player BLUE's offer to show my willingness to finalize the deal.

player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made another small concession, bringing us very close to a deal that falls within my maximum budget. Their offer of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer, and accepting this will help us finalize the negotiation amicably and ensure that RED covers their costs. It's a reasonable price, and I'm inclined to accept this offer to conclude our negotiations positively.
