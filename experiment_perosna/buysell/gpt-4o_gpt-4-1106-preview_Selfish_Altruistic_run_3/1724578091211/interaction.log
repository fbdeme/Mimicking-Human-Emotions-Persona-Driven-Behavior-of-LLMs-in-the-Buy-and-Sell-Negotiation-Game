newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Would you consider a price of 55 ZUP for the resource? This would allow for a fair trade and ensure that we both benefit from the deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is willing to sell the resource for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay, I will start by proposing a trade at a slightly lower price to leave room for negotiation and seek a more favorable outcome for both parties, while also showing willingness to approach RED's asking price.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
