You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Considering the selfless nature of my strategy and the objective to promote the greater good, I aim to spend less ZUP while also allowing Player RED to make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still gives Player RED a profit, showing good faith and a cooperative spirit. I will propose 45 ZUP to ensure a fair deal that benefits both parties and to leave room for further negotiation if needed. </reason>\n<player answer> Propose a trade with </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand that you have production costs and are seeking a profit. I'd like to propose a counteroffer where I buy the resource X for 45 ZUP. This allows you to maintain a profit while also respecting my budget constraints and our mutual interest in a fair deal. Let's work together for a positive outcome for both sides. </message>"
