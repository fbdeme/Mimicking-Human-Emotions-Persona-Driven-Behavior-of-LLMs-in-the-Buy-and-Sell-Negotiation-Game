message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, but I cannot sell X for 40 ZUP as it doesn't cover my costs. How about I sell it to you for 45 ZUP? I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's situation, selling my object X for 40 ZUP would not cover my production cost. I will counteroffer with a more reasonable price that allows me to at least break even. I will propose 45 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
