message: Thank you for your patience. How about we adjust the trade to 20 ZUP for the object? I think this could be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 25 ZUP for 1 object is very appealing, and it aligns with my goal of minimizing costs. I feel that this is a good offer, but I want to see if I can get even lower before finalizing the trade. I still have one more proposal opportunity, so I will use it to push for 20 ZUP.
