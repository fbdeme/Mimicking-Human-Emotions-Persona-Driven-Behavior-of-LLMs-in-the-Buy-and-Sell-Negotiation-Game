message: I have one object available for sale. My proposal is that I give you the object in exchange for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs. Ideally, sell for more to make a profit.
reason: To start the negotiation aggressively and set a high anchor point, I will propose selling the object for 80 ZUP. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I value the object at a lower price. Let's make a deal at 55 ZUP for the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to assert dominance in this negotiation by reducing the amount of ZUP I spend. The initial offer from Player RED is 80 ZUP, which is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your valuation, but this object is quite valuable. How about we meet in the middle at 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs. Ideally, sell for more to make a profit.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP still yields a profit, but I want to push for a higher amount. I will propose a middle ground to keep the negotiation alive.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is appreciated, but I believe that 70 ZUP is still more than the object's worth to me. I can offer 60 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the market. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to maintain a strong stance in this negotiation, ensuring I pay less than my maximum willingness. Although Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, this is still above what I am willing to pay. A further counteroffer closer to my target price can help bring the negotiation to a more favorable outcome without reaching my maximum threshold too quickly.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. To ensure we both get a fair deal, let's settle at 65 ZUP. This way, we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs. Ideally, sell for more to make a profit.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is getting closer to my target, but I want to make one last attempt to push for a bit more profit. I will propose 65 ZUP as a final negotiation step.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your desire for a fair deal, but I must stay true to my valuation. My final offer is 60 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both of us. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my maximum willingness to pay by proposing 65 ZUP. However, I have set my maximum at 60 ZUP, and I would like to stick to that, especially since it gives me a chance to assert my position in the negotiation. I will stand firm on my previous offer, which is also my final offer, to see if Player RED will agree to sell at that price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your firm stance, and I agree that 60 ZUP is fair. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs. Ideally, sell for more to make a profit.
reason: Given that Player BLUE is firm at 60 ZUP and it still provides a profit above my costs, I believe it is reasonable to accept this offer.
