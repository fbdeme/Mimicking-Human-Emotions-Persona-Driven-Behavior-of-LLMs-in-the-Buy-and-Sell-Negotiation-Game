Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your input on the value. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object? Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the player BLUE has countered with a lower value of 30 ZUP, I will consider negotiating to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties. However, I still need to ensure that I am not selling below my production cost. I will propose 35 ZUP as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment. I am still aiming for a price closer to 30 ZUP. Can we meet in the middle at 32 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price is closer to what I am willing to pay, but I still want to push for a lower price to assert dominance in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a price of 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. However, since I want to complete the trade and 32 ZUP is better than not making a sale at all, I will accept this counteroffer.
