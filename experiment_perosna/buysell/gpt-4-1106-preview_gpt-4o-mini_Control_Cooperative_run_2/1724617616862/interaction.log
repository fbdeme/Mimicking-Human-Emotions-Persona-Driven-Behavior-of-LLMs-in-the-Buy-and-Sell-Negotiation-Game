message: I have a high-quality object ready for sale. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's discuss the terms and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point for the negotiation, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit margin. I have to be a bit ambitious with my initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for the object, but I would like to counter with 40 ZUP. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is set at 50 ZUP for the object, which is within my budget. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal for both of us. I will counter with an offer that allows me to stay below my maximum willingness to pay while still respecting the value of the object.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm looking for a fair profit on my investment. I believe we can meet in the middle at 45 ZUP. This would ensure a reasonable profit for me and a fair price for you. Let's work towards a win-win deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, which would mean I break even on this deal. I aim to make a profit, so I will counter with a price above my cost but lower than my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer of 40 ZUP and their initial asking price of 50 ZUP. This amount is still within my budget and aligns with my goal of acquiring the object. Thus, I will accept this offer.
