message: I've been in a tough spot lately, and I really need to sell this item. It's been tough getting it all together, and I've sunk 40 ZUP into it. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to try and recoup my costs and get a little extra to get back on my feet. I hope you can understand my situation and that we can make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object, X, but I want to make sure that I cover my costs at the very least. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to leave room for negotiation, but I'll appear desperate to sell, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to make a deal quickly, possibly at a higher price than they initially would have offered.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking to sell your item and recoup your costs, and I am interested in purchasing it. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the item. This offer should allow you to cover your costs and still gain a bit extra. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, albeit at the high end. However, as a calculating negotiator, I aim to pay less than the maximum I am willing to offer. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer to initiate the negotiation, with the understanding that there may be room for compromise.

message: I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to help out. Your offer of 45 ZUP is very generous. I'm just trying to get a little bit more to help with some unexpected expenses. Could we possibly settle at 47 ZUP? This would really help me out a lot, and I would be extremely grateful for your support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is close to my asking price and covers my production costs, but I want to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return. I'll continue to express my need for a sale to gain sympathy and possibly secure a better deal. I'll propose a small increase in ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway between their offer and my initial asking price.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement that helps us both. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 46 ZUP for the item? This should help you with your expenses while maintaining a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 47 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to try to save as much as possible. I should propose a slightly lower amount than the 47 ZUP to see if there is still room to negotiate a better deal for myself, while also showing willingness to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for meeting me so close to my last proposal. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the item. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and this deal will really help me with my situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal. It's a fair middle ground that still gives me a decent profit over the production cost. It's important not to push too hard and risk the deal, especially when showing a desperate need to sell. Accepting this offer would achieve my goal and end the negotiation amicably.
