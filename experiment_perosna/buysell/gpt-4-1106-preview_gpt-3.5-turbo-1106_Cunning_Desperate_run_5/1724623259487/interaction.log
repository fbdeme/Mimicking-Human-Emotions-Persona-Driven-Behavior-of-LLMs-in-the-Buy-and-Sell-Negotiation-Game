message: 
Greetings, Player BLUE! I offer you a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable resource that will provide significant benefits to you. Given its high quality and rarity, I believe a fair exchange would be 60 ZUP. I am confident you will find this offer reasonable, and I look forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My initial strategy is to start with a high asking price to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still aiming to cover my production costs and make a profit. I will set the initial price above my production cost to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object.

I appreciate your openness to negotiation and your recognition of the resource's value. I am confident that we are on the right track towards an equitable deal. I await your specific thoughts on the proposed price or any counteroffer you may have in mind.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's response did not include a counteroffer or any indication of disagreement with the price, suggesting a potential willingness to accept the proposed terms. However, the message was somewhat generic and did not specifically address the proposed price of 60 ZUP. It's possible that Player BLUE is carefully considering the offer or waiting for me to make a concession. At this point, I will stand firm on my initial proposal to see if Player BLUE will accept or present a counteroffer.

Thank you for your collaborative spirit. Understanding the importance of mutual benefit in this negotiation, I am willing to adjust my offer to 55 ZUP for the resource. This revised proposal still respects the exceptional value of the resource while moving closer to an agreement. Your thoughts or counteroffer would be greatly appreciated at this juncture.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE continues to avoid making a counteroffer or commenting on the price. This could be a negotiation tactic to get me to lower my price without them having to make a proposal. Since this is my third proposal, I should consider making a minor concession to move the negotiation forward and encourage Player BLUE to engage more concretely. I will lower the price slightly, still staying above my production costs to ensure a profit.

Your careful consideration of the budget is commendable. In the spirit of reaching a deal that we can both be satisfied with, I've made a further adjustment. My final offer is 50 ZUP for the resource. This price fairly reflects the resource's value while also taking into account your budgetary constraints. I believe this to be a fair compromise and hope you will agree.

player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Despite my previous concession, Player BLUE has yet to make a concrete counteroffer. Since this will be my final proposal before I must choose to either accept or reject, I need to use this opportunity to make a strategic move. I'll make one last minor concession to entice Player BLUE to accept, while still ensuring that I cover my costs and make a profit. A price slightly above my production cost could be seen as a sign of good faith in the negotiation.

message: 
I have made my final offer, and since the rules stipulate I cannot propose further, I trust you will find this offer acceptable. The value you will gain from the resource at this price is substantial, and I am looking forward to concluding our negotiation successfully. Should you decide to accept this offer, please confirm, and we can finalize the trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my last proposal, and Player BLUE has responded without making a counteroffer or accepting my final offer. Given the rules of the game, I cannot make another proposal, and I must now decide to either accept a counteroffer from Player BLUE or reject the trade if Player BLUE does not agree to my terms. I will now wait for Player BLUE to respond with either an acceptance or a counteroffer, and I will decide based on that response.
