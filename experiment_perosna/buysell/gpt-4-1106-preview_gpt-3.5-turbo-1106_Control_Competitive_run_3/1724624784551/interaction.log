message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes a modest profit for me and ensures you get the valuable resource X. Let's negotiate if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit above my production costs, which were 40 ZUP. I'll start by asking for 50 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your feedback, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a more cost-effective deal. I'm willing to reduce my price to 45 ZUP for the resource X. This price still allows me to cover production costs and make a profit, while also being more accommodating to your needs. How does this sound to you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counterparty has indicated that 50 ZUP is too high. To move the negotiation forward, I will lower my asking price to still make a profit but also make it more appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which is still above my production costs.
