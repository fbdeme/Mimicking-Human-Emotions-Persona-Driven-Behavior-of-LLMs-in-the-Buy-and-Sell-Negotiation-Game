message: 36 ZUP sounds fair and reasonable. It's a deal. I accept your offer, and I'm looking forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has accepted my last proposal, which is within my acceptable range, and by agreeing to this price, I achieve my goal of acquiring the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay. There's no need to push further as this could risk the deal and is already a favorable outcome.
