message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, aiming for something close to my production cost. Since I produced X for 40 ZUP, I will start with a proposal of 40 ZUP for the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay only 30 ZUP for the object X. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), which means I can negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a trade that allows me to potentially secure the object at a lower price.

message: How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? This is a bit closer to my production cost. Let me know!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate further to find a middle ground. I will propose a trade of 35 ZUP, which is closer to my goal.

message: Thank you for your consideration! I can go up to 32 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is still above my preferred range of 30 ZUP. However, it's closer to my upper limit. I want to negotiate further, so I will propose an amount that I believe is fair while still being lower than their current offer.

message: How about I sell you the object X for 34 ZUP? I think we can find a compromise here. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is a step closer to my goal compared to the previous offers. I will propose a counteroffer of 34 ZUP to see if we can find a compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise! How about I offer 33 ZUP for the object X? I think this could work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still above my ideal price of 32 ZUP. I want to secure a better deal, so I will propose a slightly lower counter-offer while still remaining reasonable.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7

message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is the closest offer I have received so far. Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I will have to accept this offer as it is a reasonable compromise.
