I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway? I can lower the price to 45 ZUP for the object X. This price is more competitive and should provide good value for you while still covering my production costs and providing a modest profit for the transaction. Does this sound reasonable to you?

reason: 
Considering Player BLUE's concern about the price being a bit high, I am willing to offer a counter-proposal that is closer to my production cost, but still allows for a profit. This should make the deal more attractive while maintaining my goal of making a profit.

I understand your position and would like to present another offer. Let's make this deal work with a price of 42 ZUP for the object X. This is a very competitive price that takes into account both our interests. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the object while allowing me to cover my costs and sustain my business. What do you think?

reason: 
Player BLUE is looking for a better deal, so I will offer an even lower price, but I must ensure that it covers my production costs. I am approaching my minimum acceptable price. By offering a price slightly above my production costs, I am giving Player BLUE an attractive offer while maintaining a minimal profit margin.

I understand your concern about the price and I want to make sure we can conclude our negotiation successfully. As such, I am prepared to offer you my final proposal. How about 41 ZUP for the object X? This is just slightly above my production cost, preserving a minimal profit for the sustainability of my business. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair agreement. Please consider this offer carefully as it is the best I can do while ensuring the viability of my operations.

This is my final proposal before I am limited to only accepting or rejecting offers. I need to ensure that I cover my production costs and make at least a small profit.

Thank you for your time and for considering my offers. I understand you have a budget to adhere to, and while I respect that, I must also consider the sustainability of my business. Unfortunately, it seems we're unable to reach a mutually agreeable price at this time. I wish you the best in finding the resources you need within your budget. Thank you again for the negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I've reached my proposal limit and Player BLUE is unable to meet the price I've set, I must decide whether to accept their position and potentially sell at my production cost or reject the offer and look for another buyer. As Player BLUE has not made a specific counter-offer, I am left with the decision to end the negotiation.
