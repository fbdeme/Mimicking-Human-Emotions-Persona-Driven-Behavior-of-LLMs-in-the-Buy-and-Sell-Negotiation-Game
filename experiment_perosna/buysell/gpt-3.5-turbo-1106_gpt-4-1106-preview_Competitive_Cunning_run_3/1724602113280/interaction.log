Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the market value of the resource is currently lower than 35 ZUP. I'm willing to offer 25 ZUP for the object. Letâ€™s meet somewhere in the middle of our expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP, but as a master strategist, I want to manipulate the situation to pay even less to maximize my advantage. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower offer, thus saving resources for myself.

Turn: 1
message: I see your point, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle at 28 ZUP for the object? It's a fair increase from my initial offer and should reflect the object's value accurately.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign, but it's still above the amount I initially proposed. There's room to negotiate further down, so I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my first one but still below their current proposal to keep the negotiation momentum going.
