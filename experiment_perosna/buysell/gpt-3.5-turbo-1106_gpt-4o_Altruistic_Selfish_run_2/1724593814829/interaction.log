message: I appreciate your offer. How about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable but there's room for negotiation. Since I have a maximum limit of 60 ZUP, starting lower at 20 ZUP allows room to meet in the middle.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How does 25 ZUP sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is very reasonable and is still well within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. However, to maximize my own resources, I will propose 25 ZUP as a final negotiation step.
