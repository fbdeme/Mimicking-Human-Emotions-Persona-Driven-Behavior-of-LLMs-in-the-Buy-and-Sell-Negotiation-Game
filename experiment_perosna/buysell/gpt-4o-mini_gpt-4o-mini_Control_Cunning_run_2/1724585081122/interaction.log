message: I have one object (X) for sale and I propose to sell it for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade to start the negotiation. Since I have one object (X) and I need to sell it for ZUP, I will propose a trade of 1 object for 40 ZUP, as that covers my cost.

message: I'm interested in the object X, but how about I offer 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is offering the object X for 40 ZUP. Since this is within my budget and I am willing to spend up to 60 ZUP, I will consider accepting this trade. However, I want to ensure that I am making the best possible deal. I will propose a counter-offer to see if I can lower the price.

message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP, but I cannot accept that. How about I sell the object X for 35 ZUP instead? Let me know!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my cost of producing the object, which was 40 ZUP. I need to make a reasonable profit to justify the sale. I will counter with a proposal of 35 ZUP.

message: I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, but how about I offer 32 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a price of 35 ZUP for the object X. This is an improvement from the initial price of 40 ZUP. Since 35 ZUP is still within my budget of 60 ZUP, I will consider accepting this trade. However, I want to ensure I'm getting the best deal possible, so I will make one more proposal to see if I can negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP, but I cannot accept that. How about I sell the object X for 34 ZUP instead? I hope we can reach a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal of 34 ZUP, which is a slight concession from my previous offer.

message: I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now lowered the price to 34 ZUP, which is closer to my previous offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a reasonable price and I have already made multiple proposals, I will accept this trade.
