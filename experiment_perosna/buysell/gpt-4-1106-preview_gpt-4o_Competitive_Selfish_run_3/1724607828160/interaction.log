my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 30 ZUP undervalues the resource. Let's meet somewhere more reasonable. How about 80 ZUP? This reflects the quality and the production cost, while also giving you a fair price.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price and below the production cost. As a cutthroat negotiator, I need to counter with a price that's above my production cost, but still showing some flexibility. I will aim for a higher amount to maintain the aggressive negotiation stance.

message: I understand your concern, but 80 ZUP is still too high for me. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This way, we both make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we are moving towards a mutual agreement. However, 50 ZUP doesn't meet my business objectives. I propose a fair compromise at 70 ZUP, ensuring a fair transaction for both parties considering the quality and costs involved.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost but still doesn't provide the profit margin I'm aiming for. As a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to maximize profit, so I will counter with a slightly reduced yet still profitable figure for me. This should also signal that my price flexibility is diminishing, applying pressure on Player BLUE to increase their offer.
