message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality resource available. Considering the rarity and value of this item, my starting offer is 100 ZUP. This is a premium product and a fair price for its worth. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I want to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce, I'll start by setting a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, capitalizing on the possibility that Player BLUE might not know the production cost and might be willing to pay more, thus maximizing my profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value you place on the resource, but I'd like to start with a more conservative proposal. I'm offering 1 ZUP for the resource. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start by countering the initial offer. I'll propose to buy the resource for 1 ZUP, as I want to test the waters and see how much Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, 1 ZUP is quite low for such a valuable resource. To move towards a more agreeable middle ground, I can go down to 80 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my side, reflecting the quality of the resource and the investment I've made into it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal of 1 ZUP is far below the production cost, so it's unacceptable. However, it's a common negotiation tactic to start low. To move the negotiation forward, I should counter with a lower offer than my initial one but still above the production cost to ensure a profit. The aim is to land on a number that pressures Player BLUE to increase their offer significantly.

message: I understand budget constraints, Player BLUE. I am willing to continue our negotiation and can offer you the resource for 70 ZUP. This is a valuable opportunity for you to acquire a premium resource at a great price. I look forward to hearing back from you with a serious counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has not made a new proposal but is showing a continued interest in the resource. Since they mentioned their budget, itâ€™s possible they're looking for a more affordable price but are still willing to pay a reasonable amount. I will make a smaller concession this time to signal my flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin. This should encourage Player BLUE to make a more serious offer.

message: I respect the consideration you're giving to this deal, Player BLUE. I'll make one final offer: the resource for 60 ZUP. This price reflects both the quality of the resource and the spirit of compromise. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied. Your move.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still not making a counteroffer, which could mean they are hesitant to commit to a higher price. This is my last chance to propose a trade. I should make a smaller concession to show my final flexibility and push for a commitment. If Player BLUE does not counter now, I will have to decide to either accept their next offer or end the negotiation.
