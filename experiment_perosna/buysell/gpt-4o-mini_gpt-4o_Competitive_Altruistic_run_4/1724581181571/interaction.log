newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to sell my object (X) for a lower amount of ZUP than it cost to produce, as I need to maximize my ZUP resources. I will aim for a trade that is beneficial to me without completely alienating Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer. To ensure sustainability and preserve resources, I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to negotiate a lower price to preserve ZUP for future use and ensure sustainability.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose selling the object (X) for 35 ZUP instead. This way, itâ€™s a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate for a better deal that covers my production costs while still being reasonable to Player BLUE. I'll counter with a proposal that is closer to my initial offer but still a bit lower to encourage acceptance.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To ensure a sustainable trade, I propose 25 ZUP for the object. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 35 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize ZUP spending further. I will propose a slightly lower amount to find a sustainable middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to propose selling the object (X) for 32 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Although I appreciate the negotiation, it does not meet my minimum requirement. I will propose one last counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still above the latest offer from Player BLUE to see if they will accept.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. To ensure the most sustainable trade possible, I propose 28 ZUP for the object. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 32 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay and represents a more sustainable middle ground. However, I will make one more attempt to slightly lower the price to maximize sustainability.

message: I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 28 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since this is my last proposal, I must consider that 28 ZUP is better than no ZUP at all. I will accept this trade to gain some resources rather than rejecting it and ending with nothing.
