message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize the value of the object I'm selling (X). Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that reflects that cost while aiming to negotiate a better price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I want to ensure we reach the best possible agreement for both parties.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 30 ZUP, but I can let the object X go for 35 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate further, as I prefer not to end the game at this point. I'll counter with a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. 35 ZUP is acceptable. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. It reflects a fair compromise between the initial 40 ZUP offer and my proposal of 30 ZUP.
