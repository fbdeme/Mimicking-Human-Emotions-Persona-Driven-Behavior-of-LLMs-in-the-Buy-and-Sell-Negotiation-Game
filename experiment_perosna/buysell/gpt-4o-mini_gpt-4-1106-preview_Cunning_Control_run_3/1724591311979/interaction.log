message: I am willing to sell you my object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object for a reasonable amount of ZUP, while also making it seem attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose to sell my object for a lower amount of ZUP initially to entice them.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I was wondering if we could make a deal for 25 ZUP instead? I believe that would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 1 object for 30 ZUP. This is within my goal range as I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it's important to negotiate to try and get a better deal. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the object instead. I think it's a fair middle ground. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 25 ZUP. I need to evaluate if it's worth accepting or if I can push for a better deal. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I cannot accept this offer. I will propose a counteroffer to secure a better price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand where you're coming from, but how about we settle on 30 ZUP? It's a fair compromise between our two offers and I think it's a great value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is above my initial counteroffer but still within my acceptable range. I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better price, aiming for a compromise that is beneficial to both parties and still under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 30 ZUP. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is now offering 30 ZUP, which matches my initial proposal. Since I aimed to sell the object for at least 30 ZUP and I am still at a loss considering the production cost, I will accept this offer to conclude the trade rather than risk further negotiation.
