message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is just an initial proposal, and I'm open to hearing your counteroffer. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on my investment, but I also need to consider what Player BLUE might be willing to pay. For the initial proposal, I'll set the price slightly higher than my production costs to open up room for negotiation but still aim for a profit.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of 47 ZUP. This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with fair value for the object. I think this could be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is just slightly above my production costs. I would like to counter with a higher amount to ensure a profit, but I must also be careful not to set the price too high as to deter them from purchasing. I will aim for a middle ground between our two proposed prices.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the object and allows for a modest profit on my end. I accept your offer, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at 46 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a small increase in their offer, which is closer to my proposed amount. Their offer of 46 ZUP would allow me to make a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. Considering the negotiation process and the need to make a sale, it is reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction.
