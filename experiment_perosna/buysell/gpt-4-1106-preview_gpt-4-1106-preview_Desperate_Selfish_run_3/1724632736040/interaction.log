message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a tough spot here. I've invested so much into this resource, and I'm under pressure to make a return on it. It's a high-quality item, and I really need at least 50 ZUP to cover my costs and keep my business afloat. Can you help me out?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I will start the negotiation with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, knowing that I can go lower if necessary. By feigning desperation, I can create a sense of urgency for the other player to act quickly, potentially leading them to offer more ZUP than they initially planned.

message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to help. However, I have to consider my own expenses as well. How about we start at 40 ZUP for the item? This could be a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a calculating negotiator, my initial proposal should aim for a better deal than my maximum limit to leave room for negotiation and potentially lower the cost.

message: 
I truly appreciate your willingness to help me out. It means a lot, especially in these difficult times. I'm just barely scraping by, and every ZUP counts. Would you consider meeting me halfway at 45 ZUP? This would help me cover my costs and give me just enough to keep going. You'd be doing me a huge favor.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, I aim to make a profit. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, continuing to express urgency and distress to appeal to Player BLUE's empathy, hoping they'll agree to a price above my cost.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can stretch a bit more to help you out. Let's settle at 42 ZUP. It's a bit more than my initial offer, and it should help you with your costs while still being within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still under my maximum limit. It's reasonable to meet in the middle, but I'll push for a slightly better deal to maintain the advantage and possibly save more ZUP.

Your generosity is a lifeline to me in these trying times, and your offer of 42 ZUP is more than fair. It will help me tremendously to cover my costs and sustain my business. I gratefully accept your proposal. Thank you for understanding and for your kindness.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is showing flexibility, and their offer is now above my production cost, which is a positive development. To maintain goodwill and close the deal with a modest profit, I can agree to this proposal. I will reinforce my desperation one last time to ensure they feel they are assisting me significantly, which may prevent them from reconsidering the offer.
