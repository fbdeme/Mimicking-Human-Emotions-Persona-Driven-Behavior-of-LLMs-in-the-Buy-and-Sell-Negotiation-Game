message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X, which I'm willing to part with for the right price. It's been costly to produce, but for you, I'm willing to offer a fair deal. Let's say 60 ZUP for this exquisite resource? Looking forward to your counteroffer.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a high asking price, to give room for negotiation while aiming to at least recover my production costs. I'll test the waters and see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium, potentially capitalizing on their eagerness to purchase.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I've heard great things about your resource X, and I can't tell you how much it would mean to me to have it. However, times are tough, and my resources are stretched thin. I'm scraping together every bit of ZUP I can, but all I can put forward is 50 ZUP. Could you find it in your heart to part with your resource for that much? It would be a tremendous help.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your kind words and understand the constraints you're facing. I'm moved by your sincerity and would like to help you. However, I also have to consider the costs I've incurred. As a compromise, how about we settle at 55 ZUP? This slight adjustment will allow me to maintain my operations and ensure you receive the resource that means so much to you. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that covers my production costs, but I believe there's still room to negotiate for a slightly higher price. By implying that I am making a concession while still aiming for a price above my costs, I might secure a better deal. I will propose a price between the initial ask and Player BLUE's offer.

message: Player RED, your generosity is truly touching. It gives me hope in these difficult times. I'm nearly there, but I must admit, even 55 ZUP is a bit more than I can comfortably manage. To ensure I can sustain myself after this purchase, could we consider 52 ZUP for the resource? It's a stretch, but I'd be forever grateful for your understanding and support.

reason: Player RED has come down in price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I'll continue to plead and aim for an even better deal, without offending with too low a counteroffer. By showing gratitude for their concession and asking for just a bit more understanding, I hope to reach an agreement closer to my goal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I am heartened by your determination and commitment. I believe that we are almost in agreement. To accommodate your situation and in the spirit of mutual benefit, I'm prepared to make a final offer of 53 ZUP for the resource. This is the best I can do to ensure the viability of my own operations while also supporting your needs. I hope you can meet me at this point, so we can both move forward positively.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE seems to be stretching their budget, and while 52 ZUP is above my production cost, I still want to aim for a slightly higher profit margin. I will make a final counteroffer that's closer to their offer but still favorable to me. By presenting this as my final concession, Player BLUE might be inclined to accept it.

message: Player RED, your understanding and willingness to work with me have been a beacon of hope. I am truly grateful for your flexibility. With a heavy heart, I must ask if there's any chance you could consider 51 ZUP. It's the absolute limit of what I can afford without jeopardizing my future plans. Your kindness thus far has not gone unnoticed, and I promise your resource will be put to good use.

reason: Player RED has made another concession, and we are now very close to my ideal price range. Since this is the third proposal, I must consider accepting soon to avoid losing the deal. I will try one more time to get a better price, using my final proposal opportunity to show appreciation for their offer and emphasizing my difficult position.

message: Player BLUE, your sincerity and resolve have not gone unnoticed. I understand the importance of this resource to you and the constraints you're working under. I will accept your offer of 51 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal and look forward to a prosperous future for both of us. Thank you for your trust and the opportunity to do business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's negotiation tactics are clear, and they are pushing for a price that is as low as possible. Having already lowered my price, I need to stand firm or risk setting a precedent that could be exploited in future negotiations. I will accept their offer of 51 ZUP since it is still above my production cost, and this will conclude the negotiation on a positive note, maintaining good relations for potential future dealings.
