message: I'm in a bit of a tight spot and really need to make this sale. I produced this resource at a cost of 40 ZUP, so I'm just looking to make a small profit. Can you do 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production cost and adds a small profit. By seeming desperate, I aim to make the offer appear more attractive to Player BLUE, who might be motivated to accept it quickly.

Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted at 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is proposing to sell the resource for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget and will still leave me with ample resources. This seems like a fair deal as it is just above their production cost and within my willingness to pay.
