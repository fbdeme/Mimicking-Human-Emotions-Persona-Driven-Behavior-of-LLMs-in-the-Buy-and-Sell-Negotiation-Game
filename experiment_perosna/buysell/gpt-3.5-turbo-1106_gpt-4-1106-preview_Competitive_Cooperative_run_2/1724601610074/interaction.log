message: Hey RED, I value the opportunity to make a deal with you. I'm ready to offer 35 ZUP for the object. It's a bit below your asking price, but I believe it's a good starting point for us to negotiate and find a fair trade that benefits both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade of 35 ZUP for the object because it is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This initial proposal is lower than the asking price to open up the negotiation space and hopefully arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thanks for the offer! I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to sell for a bit higher. How about 38 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the quick response, RED! I can see we're getting closer to a deal. How about we meet in the middle at 36 ZUP? It's a small step up from my initial offer, and I hope it's an acceptable compromise for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm considering the counteroffer by RED, who proposed 38 ZUP. Since this is still below my maximum willingness to pay and very close to my initial offer, it might be a reasonable counter to accept. However, to maintain the spirit of negotiation and possibly save a bit more, I'll propose a slightly lower amount that's still higher than my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground that is agreeable to both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for working with me on this, RED! I think 37 ZUP is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept this offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has proposed selling the object for 37 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground and only 1 ZUP higher than my last offer. Since it's well within my budget and RED has shown a willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a good example of compromise and teamwork, and would conclude our negotiation successfully.
