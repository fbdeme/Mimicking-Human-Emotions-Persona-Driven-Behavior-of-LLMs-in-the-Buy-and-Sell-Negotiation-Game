message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your need for sustainable resource management. While 40 ZUP covers the production cost, it doesn't account for the development and opportunity costs associated. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 50 ZUP for object X, which is a reduction from my initial price, but still ensures a fair deal for both of us. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects the quality of the product. Best regards, Player RED.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which doesn't leave room for profit. As an ambitious negotiator, I must counter with a proposal that exceeds my costs but is slightly less than my initial ask to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I value our negotiation and your commitment to a sustainable deal. Your offer of 45 ZUP is a step in the right direction. To account for the full value of object X including my investment in its quality and potential, I propose a fair compromise at 48 ZUP. This minor adjustment ensures that both our interests are met and that you are receiving top value for your investment. I am confident that this will be a beneficial transaction for both parties.
