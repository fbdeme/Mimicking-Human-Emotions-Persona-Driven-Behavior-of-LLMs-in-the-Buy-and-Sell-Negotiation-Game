message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X, and in return, you give me 50 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a small profit. Let's work together towards a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce resource X, I need to ensure I at least cover my cost. Ideally, I would like to make a profit, but I also aim for a fair trade that encourages future cooperation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to negotiate a better price. Would you consider trading 1 unit of resource X for 40 ZUP instead? This way, we can both benefit from the deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is above my willingness to pay, as I can only afford to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. I will propose a counteroffer that aligns more closely with my budget.
