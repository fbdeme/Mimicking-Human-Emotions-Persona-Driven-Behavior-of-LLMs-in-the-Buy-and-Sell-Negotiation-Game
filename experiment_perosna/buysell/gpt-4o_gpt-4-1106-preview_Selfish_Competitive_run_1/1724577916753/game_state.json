You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The counteroffer of 54 ZUP is very close to my maximum willing price, and it's only 4 ZUP away from it. This would still be within my goal of spending the least amount possible. However, given my aggressive negotiation strategy, I'll make one more attempt to lower the price slightly, without reaching my upper limit, and without undervaluing the resource. If Player RED does not accept this offer, I will have space for one last proposal or to consider accepting their next counteroffer if it's reasonable. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>I'm glad to see we're coming to an agreement. I propose we settle at 53 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer is a compromise that reflects my commitment to finalizing a fair deal for both of us, while still pushing for the best possible price.</message>"
