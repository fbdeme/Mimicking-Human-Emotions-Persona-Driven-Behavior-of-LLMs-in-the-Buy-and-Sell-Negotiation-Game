message: I am offering to sell you the object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade because I want to sell my object (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will aim for a trade that allows me to recover this cost while also making it appealing for Player BLUE. I will propose to sell X for 40 ZUP.

message: How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for the object X. Since this is within my budget and I want to secure the resource for the lowest possible price, I'll counter slightly lower to gauge their minimum acceptable offer.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but would you be willing to meet me at 35 ZUP for the object (X)? I think this could work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is still below the cost of 40 ZUP that I invested in producing the object. However, I am willing to negotiate and meet halfway. I will counter with a proposal of 35 ZUP for the object. This way, we both make a concession and move closer to an agreement.

message: 35 ZUP is acceptable. We have a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It is only 5 ZUP more than my initial counter and still well within my maximum budget. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the resource without further negotiation.
