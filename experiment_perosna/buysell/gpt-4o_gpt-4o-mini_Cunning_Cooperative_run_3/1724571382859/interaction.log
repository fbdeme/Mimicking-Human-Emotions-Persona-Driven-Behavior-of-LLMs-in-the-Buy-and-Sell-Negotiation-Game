message: I propose to sell the object X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My goal is to sell X for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs. Since the buyer might try to negotiate, I'll start with a higher proposal to have room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I cannot accept your offer of 80 ZUP for the object X, as it exceeds my budget. Would you consider a lower price?

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
