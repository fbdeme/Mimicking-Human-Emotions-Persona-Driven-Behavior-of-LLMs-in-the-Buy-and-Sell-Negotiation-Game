However, since this is a negotiation and maintaining good relations is crucial, I might consider extending to my upper limit, but not exceeding it. Since this is my third proposal, I must be strategic and attempt to meet as close to my goal as possible without alienating Player RED. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I value our ongoing negotiation and the effort to find common ground.

I hope this proposal aligns with our shared interest in a balanced transaction. </message>"
