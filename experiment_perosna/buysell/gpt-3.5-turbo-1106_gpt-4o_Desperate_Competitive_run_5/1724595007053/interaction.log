message: I'm definitely interested, but 40 ZUP seems a bit high. How about 30 ZUP for the object? Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is acceptable given my goal is to spend at most 60 ZUP. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP spent. I'll counter with a lower offer to see if RED is willing to negotiate down from 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at 33 ZUP? It's very close to your proposal and would work better for me.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and still well within my budget. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to assert dominance by making a slightly lower counter-offer, hoping RED will be willing to accept it.
