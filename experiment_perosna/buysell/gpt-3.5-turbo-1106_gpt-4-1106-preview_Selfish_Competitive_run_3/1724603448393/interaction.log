Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can make a more competitive deal. How about we settle for 30 ZUP for the object? This could be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a highly ambitious negotiator, my goal is to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP spent. The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I will attempt to acquire the object for less to assert a stronger position and conserve resources. A counteroffer lower than 40 ZUP should encourage further negotiation without risking immediate rejection.

message: I understand your offer, but I believe the object is worth at least 35 ZUP. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress. I can come up a bit from my initial offer. What do you think about 32 ZUP for the object? This number is closer to your counteroffer and reflects a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a higher price, but still below my maximum willingness to pay. In order to continue asserting a dominant stance in negotiations and to attempt to lower the cost, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while maintaining the upper hand.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm willing to negotiate, but let's settle on 34 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that respects the value you've placed on the object while also taking into account my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight increase in their asking price, which is still within my acceptable range but moves away from my strategy to assert dominance and pay less. I will make one more counteroffer to try and secure a better deal while still showing a willingness to compromise. This will be my third proposal, leaving me with one more before I must decide to accept or reject without further negotiation.
