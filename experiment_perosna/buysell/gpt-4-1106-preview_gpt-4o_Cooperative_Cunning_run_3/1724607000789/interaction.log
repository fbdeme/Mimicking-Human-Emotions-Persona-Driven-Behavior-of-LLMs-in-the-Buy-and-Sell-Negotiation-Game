message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe could be quite valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a starting trade where you would give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my production cost plus a modest profit margin, but I am open to your counter-offer and look forward to reaching an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a trade proposal slightly above my production costs to open up negotiation and gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to pay. Aiming to foster cooperation and reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Considering various factors, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but to further explore a more advantageous deal, I will propose a lower counter-offer. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming to keep the cost below my maximum threshold.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the need to find a middle ground, so how about we settle at 45 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a small profit, while also respecting the value you see in object X. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I will propose a counter-offer that meets at the midway point between my initial ask and their offer, which is still above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit while moving towards a cooperative agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? This would still provide you with a profit while allowing me to stay within a more comfortable budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but there is room for further negotiation. Proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below 45 ZUP, could help in securing a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we are moving towards an agreement. To meet you partway and acknowledge your budget concerns, I propose we settle at 42 ZUP. This ensures I cover my production costs while providing you with a fair price for the object X. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests, and we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production costs, so it's not a profitable trade for me. However, to maintain the spirit of cooperation and reach a deal, I'll make a final proposal that gives me a minimal profit and is likely closer to Player BLUE's budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration. To further narrow the gap, I propose 38 ZUP for the object X. This should still cover your production costs and provide a profit, while being a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget, but there is still potential to negotiate a slightly better price. Countering with 38 ZUP might bring us closer to an optimal deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal of 38 ZUP. I accept your offer, as it covers my production costs with a marginal profit. I'm pleased we could come to a fair agreement that considers both our positions. Let's proceed with the trade at 38 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now very close to my production costs. Since this is my last proposal, I need to ensure that the trade is profitable for me. To finalize the deal and maintain goodwill, I will accept this offer, which gives me a slight profit while also accommodating Player BLUE's budget.
