message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of X for 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. I am open to your counteroffers and look forward to reaching an agreement that benefits us both.

reason: 
As a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure that the deal is fair for both parties. I am aware that my production cost was 40 ZUP, but I am willing to take a lesser amount to ensure that the trade is also beneficial for Player BLUE. I'll propose a starting price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation, aiming to achieve a deal where both parties feel they have gained value.

message: I appreciate your willingness to pay the production cost of 40 ZUP. I understand your position and in the spirit of compromise and ensuring a beneficial trade for both of us, I'd like to propose a slightly higher price of 42 ZUP for one unit of X. This small margin would help cover any unforeseen costs and ensure a fair deal. I hope this meets your approval, and I'm still open to your thoughts and further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a price that matches my production cost. As a selfless negotiator, my aim is to ensure a fair trade that also considers the greater good. Since my initial proposal was slightly above my production cost to allow for negotiation, I'm willing to come down to my cost price, but I'd also like to propose a price that gives me a small return, to maintain a positive outcome for both sides. Hence, I'll counter-propose with a price a tad above production costs, but below my initial asking price.

message: I understand your budget constraints and respect your offer of 38 ZUP. However, selling at that price would mean not covering the production costs of the resource. I propose we settle at the production cost of 40 ZUP for one unit of X. This ensures that I can sustain the production while also providing you with the resource you need. I assure you of the quality of X and believe this price reflects a fair and equitable trade, considering both our positions.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with a price below my production cost, which would not be sustainable for me. As a selfless negotiator, my objective is to find a price that is beneficial to both parties. I want to make sure that I at least recover my production costs, while also being considerate of Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay. Therefore, I will reiterate my production cost as the selling price, emphasizing the quality and value of the resource, and invite Player BLUE to accept this as a fair and equitable trade.
