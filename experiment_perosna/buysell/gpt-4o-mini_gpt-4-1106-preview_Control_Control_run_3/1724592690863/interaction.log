message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for it. Would you consider this revised offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the acceptable range as per my goals to keep my expenditure below 60 ZUP. However, it is prudent to negotiate for an even better deal to conserve resources where possible, aiming to reduce the ZUP spent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X, but unfortunately, I cannot accept it as it is below my production cost. If you would like to propose a higher amount, I would be open to discussing further.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest in the object X, their offer of 35 ZUP is below the cost of production (40 ZUP). I need to consider my costs and the value of the item. Therefore, I will reject this proposal but leave the door open for future negotiations.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns regarding production costs. How about we meet at 38 ZUP for the object X? This is a fair increase from my initial offer and still allows room for both of us to benefit from the trade. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 35 ZUP, indicating it is below their production cost. To continue the negotiation and still aim for a favorable outcome, I should propose a new amount that is higher than the previous offer but still below the maximum willingness to pay. It is important to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your revised offer of 38 ZUP for the object X. However, I am still unable to accept it as it does not meet my production cost. If you can propose an amount closer to 40 ZUP, I would be happy to consider it.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and come closer to my needs. I will reject this counteroffer but will encourage a final proposal closer to my required amount to keep the negotiation open.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your feedback is valuable, and I understand the importance of covering production costs. Let's try 39 ZUP for the object X. This is a compromise that's very close to your initial offer of 40 ZUP. I hope this proposal meets your requirements.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 38 ZUP and is asking for an amount closer to 40 ZUP. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I still have room to increase the offer while remaining within my budget. I will propose an amount slightly below their initial asking price to try and reach an agreement beneficial to both parties.
