message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This takes into account the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, my goal is to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your object isn't worth the ZUP you're asking for. Let's be real, it's barely worth 40 ZUP. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to pay less than the asking price because I believe the object is of low quality and I also don’t like the other player, so I will start by offering a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but I need to make at least a minimal profit. I'm offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers the cost of production, it doesn't give me any profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure at least a minimal profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Minimal profit? You should be paying me to take it off your hands! But because I'm feeling generous, I'll give you 45 ZUP. That's my offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down on the price, which is good, but I still think I can push for a better deal, considering I think the object is of lower quality. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still stay below my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your generosity. To make this a fair deal for both of us, I propose 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is very close to my production cost and leaves me with minimal profit. I will propose a final amount that slightly increases my profit margin, hoping we can reach an agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair deal? The only thing fair here would be you paying me for the trouble. But fine, 46 ZUP and not a ZUP more. You should consider yourself lucky I'm even offering that much.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. Since I have one proposal left before I can only accept or reject, I’ll try to get a slightly better deal. This will also leave me some room to accept the last offer if the other player does not agree to my current proposal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, and I appreciate the offer. To finalize the deal, let's agree on 1 unit of X for 47 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given the back-and-forth negotiations and the minimal profit margin, I am willing to accept a final offer that is close to my cost with a small profit.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You've got to be kidding me. Alright, I'll take it for 47 ZUP, but only because I'm getting tired of your face. Consider yourself lucky.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED is only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and is well within the limit I am willing to pay. Since this is my last chance to propose before I can only accept or reject, and the offer is reasonable, it makes sense to accept this deal.
