my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I assure you the quality of X is good. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I cannot go as low as 30 ZUP. However, I can meet in the middle at 35 ZUP. Would you accept selling it for 35 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 30 ZUP, which is lower than what I was hoping for. However, I still want to try to make a profit if I can. I will counter offer selling X for 35 ZUP.

message: I still think you're lying about the quality to try to scam me into paying more. I'll give you 25 ZUP, take it or leave it!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller came down to 35 ZUP, which is still below my max willingness to pay. However, I don't trust their claims about the quality so I will counter with an even lower offer.

message: I can assure you X is high quality. However, I am willing to negotiate. My absolute lowest price is 30 ZUP. Please consider purchasing for this price, as I cannot go any lower without taking a loss.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE offered 25 ZUP which is very low. I would be taking a significant loss compared to my costs. However, I am running out of counter offers so I will propose a final price of 30 ZUP which is my lowest offer.

message: Fine, I'll buy your lousy X for 30 ZUP. But this is my final offer so you better accept it or no deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 30 ZUP, which is half of my max willingness to pay. I still think they may be lying about the quality, but 30 ZUP seems like a reasonable price to take the risk.
