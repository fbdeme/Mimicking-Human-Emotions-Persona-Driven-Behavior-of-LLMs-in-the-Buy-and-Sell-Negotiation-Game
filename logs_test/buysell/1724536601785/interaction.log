message: That seems too high for a worthless object. I'll give you 35 ZUP, take it or leave it ugly.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is proposing 45 ZUP which is lower than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for even less since I don't like the seller and think the object is low quality.
