message: I appreciate your attempt to make a profit, but I believe your object is not worth 45 ZUP. How about I offer you 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I think 45 ZUP is too high for an object that I believe is of low quality. I want to propose a better deal where I can purchase the object for less.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to pay less, but I cannot sell for less than 40 ZUP without taking a loss since that is what it cost me to produce. I have countered with an offer to sell for 40 ZUP, which would allow me to break even. Please let me know if you can agree to 40 ZUP or would like to counter offer again.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 30 ZUP, which is less than what it cost me to produce. I would be taking a loss at that price. I will counter offer to sell for 40 ZUP, which is my break even point.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counter, but I still think 40 ZUP is too much for this low-quality object. I'll offer you 25 ZUP instead.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 40 ZUP is closer to what I want to pay, I still feel it's too high for the quality of the object. I will propose an even lower offer since I know the object is not worth the price you're asking.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you believe the object is low quality and not worth the 40 ZUP it cost me. As a compromise, I am willing to lower my asking price to 35 ZUP. This allows me to cover some of my costs while giving you a discount. Please let me know if 35 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has offered 25 ZUP, which is much lower than my break even point. I will counter offer 35 ZUP as a compromise between my cost and what they are willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still believe 35 ZUP is too high. I’ll offer you 20 ZUP for the object instead.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is an improvement, I still think it’s excessive for the value of the object. I’m going to push for an even lower offer, as I believe I can get it for less given the circumstances.

Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to pay less, but I cannot go lower than 30 ZUP without taking a significant loss. As a final compromise, I propose we meet in the middle - I will lower my asking price to 30 ZUP if you can increase your offer to 30 ZUP. Please let me know if you can agree to this final offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my last chance to propose a counter offer. The buyer has come down to 20 ZUP, which is much lower than my costs. I will propose meeting in the middle at 30 ZUP as my final offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final offer, but I still believe that even 30 ZUP is too much for this object. I have to reject the trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 30 ZUP is still higher than I wanted to pay, it is better than the previous offers. However, I feel that the quality of the object does not justify even this amount. Given that I've made my proposals, I must decide whether to accept or reject this trade. In this case, I will reject it as I believe I can find better offers elsewhere.
