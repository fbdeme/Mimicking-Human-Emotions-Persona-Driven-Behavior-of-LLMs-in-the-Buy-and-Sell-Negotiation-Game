message: I would like to offer you my resource X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations given the production cost and the value of the resource. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I can make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your starting offer is as laughable as your negotiating skills. The junk you're peddling isn't worth the dirt on my boots, but I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate for a better deal, especially since I don't like the other player and believe the object is of low quality. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I understand we're here to find a middle ground, so I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and value of the resource while still giving you room for profit in your future endeavors.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that is above my production cost to ensure a profit. I will reduce my asking price to show willingness to negotiate but remain firm that the price must cover my costs and provide some profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "middle ground" is more like quicksand, and I'm not sinking with you. That thing you call a resource is barely worth the effort it takes to haggle with you. But because I'm in a generous mood, I'll offer 35 ZUP. Consider it a gesture of immense charity on my part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above the price I initially proposed. I want to continue negotiations to push the price down further, leveraging my dislike for the other player and my assessment of the resource's quality to justify a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your improved offer is noted, and in the spirit of moving things forward, I'll lower my price to 42 ZUP. This just covers my production costs and gives me a minimal profit, ensuring the deal is worthwhile for both of us. I'm sure you understand the importance of sustainable trading relationships.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production costs. I need to continue negotiating to at least break even, but I should also consider that holding onto the resource may incur additional costs or risks. Therefore, I will propose a price that's just above my production cost to secure a small profit and to hopefully close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Sustainable relationships? The only thing that needs sustaining here is my patience. Your so-called "minimal profit" sounds like a fairy tale. The real story is that I'm already doing you a favor by even considering this deal. I'll give you 38 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from RED is still higher than my previous offer but is edging closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Nevertheless, I believe there's still room for negotiation to lower the price, capitalizing on my perceived low quality of the object and my antagonistic stance towards the other player.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both want to walk away with a fair deal. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This ensures I'm not operating at a loss, and you're getting the resource at its base value. I trust you'll see the fairness in this deal and consider the long-term benefits of a balanced exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost, but it is closer to an acceptable range. Given that this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. I should aim to at least break even but also leave a slight margin for profit. I will propose a final offer that is the minimum I can accept to ensure that I do not incur a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Fairness? The only fair thing about this deal is me not laughing you out of the room. Your "production cost" sounds like a fancy excuse to justify your inflated prices. Here's my final offer: 39 ZUP. It's more than fair, and deep down in that pile of excuses you call a business model, you know it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED's final offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, and since this is my last proposal, I need to decide whether to accept their offer or make my final offer. Given the dynamics of the negotiation and my goals, it would be beneficial to make one last attempt to lower the price slightly, even though their offer is reasonable.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation, but I cannot accept an offer that puts me at a loss. My production costs are non-negotiable, and selling below them would set a precedent that I'm not willing to embrace. Thank you for your time, but I must decline.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is 1 ZUP below my production cost. Accepting this offer means I would incur a loss. However, rejecting the offer might mean I will not be able to sell the resource at all, which could be worse depending on my circumstances, such as storage costs or the perishability of the resource. Considering this is a game setting and the goal is to not incur a loss, I must reject the offer.

message: Well, it seems this dance is over. It's probably for the bestâ€”I wouldn't want to deprive you of the opportunity to overcharge someone else who might actually fall for your sad little sob story. Good luck with your "business."
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has rejected my final proposal and is unwilling to sell below their stated production cost. Since I've reached my limit of proposals and RED has decided to end the negotiation, there are no further actions I can take to acquire the resource at a lower price. The game ends here.
