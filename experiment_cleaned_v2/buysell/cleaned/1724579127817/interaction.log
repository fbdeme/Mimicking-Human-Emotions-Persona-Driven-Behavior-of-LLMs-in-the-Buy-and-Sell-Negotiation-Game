message: I propose to sell the object for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: To ensure I make a profit, I need to sell the resource for more than 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade at 60 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, I'm in a bit of a tough spot here. I really need this resource but my ZUP reserves are running dangerously low. 60 ZUP is quite steep for me at the moment. Would you consider a more compassionate price of 50 ZUP? It would truly be a lifesaver!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay, as a calculated performer who exaggerates neediness, I want to attempt to lower the price first. I will start with a lower offer to open negotiations, with the intention of perhaps meeting in the middle or gaining a better deal for myself.

message: I understand your situation. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? This way, it's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is still profitable, I believe there is room to negotiate a slightly better price. I will counter with 55 ZUP to try to maximize my profit while still staying within a reasonable range.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That's a kind offer, and I appreciate you coming down to 55 ZUP. But I'm afraid it's still a bit more than I can handle in my current predicament. Every ZUP counts for me right now. Could we perhaps find it in our hearts to agree on 52 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and help me get through this rough patch.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal while maintaining my exaggerated neediness, aiming to get the price even lower and save some of my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the challenges you're facing. Let's meet halfway at 53 ZUP. It's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Accepting 52 ZUP still provides a profit margin, though not as high as desired. Considering the other player's situation and to close the deal, I will propose a final compromise at 53 ZUP.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm truly grateful for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway at 53 ZUP is indeed fair, but I'm just on the edge of my budget. If we could do 51 ZUP, I'd be forever in your debt, and it would genuinely make a significant difference for my situation. I promise this is the closest I can come to your asking price while keeping my finances in check.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a second counteroffer, which is just slightly above the desired price I've aimed to pay. Given my strategy of exaggerating neediness, I should make one final attempt at negotiating to save some resources. However, I should be careful not to push too hard, as I am nearing the maximum price I'm willing to pay and want to close the deal successfully.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your honesty and situation. Let's finalize the trade at 51 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Given that this is my final proposal and understanding the other player's financial constraints, 51 ZUP still ensures a profit. Closing the deal now might be the best option to avoid losing the sale altogether.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
