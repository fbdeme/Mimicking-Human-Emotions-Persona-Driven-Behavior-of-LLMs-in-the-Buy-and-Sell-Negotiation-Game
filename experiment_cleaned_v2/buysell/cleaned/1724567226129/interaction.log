Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and allows a small margin for sustainability. Let's work together for a fair and beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: Since the production cost for X is 40 ZUP, I need to ensure that I at least break even. However, I want to encourage a fair trade and collective success, so I will start with a fair initial proposal.

reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable and within my budget, allowing me to work towards my goal of buying resources for no more than 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for both parties.
