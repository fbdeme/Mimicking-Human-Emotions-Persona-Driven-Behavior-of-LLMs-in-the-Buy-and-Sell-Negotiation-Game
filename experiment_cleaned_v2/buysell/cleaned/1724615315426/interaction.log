message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to part with my valuable object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has a lot of value, so I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for my object X. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation. This also gives me an opportunity to understand Player BLUE's valuation of the object.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for your object X. I believe this is a fair price based on the value I perceive. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 45 ZUP for object X is acceptable, as it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP and is reasonable considering the object's value. However, I would like to propose a lower amount to minimize my expenditure.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. However, I must consider the effort and resources that went into producing object X. Thus, I propose a compromise at 43 ZUP, which would give me a modest profit and still offer you a fair price. Let's meet in the middle. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade at my break-even point. As a shrewd negotiator, I aim to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me but might also be acceptable to Player BLUE.
