message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is a high-quality resource and worth every bit of the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I make a profit above the cost of producing the resource, which is 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will start with a high initial offer to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 60 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high for the resource. I am willing to offer a lower amount since my goal is to spend at most 60 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer to negotiate a better price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the resource's value is higher. How about we meet halfway at 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I believe I can push for a higher price to maximize my profit. I will make a counter-offer to see if they are willing to meet me closer to my initial proposal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
