message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers me a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my costs and gives me a profit. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will ask for a higher amount to ensure some profit margin. I will propose 50 ZUP, which gives me a decent profit and still leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is reasonable, but I am willing to negotiate for a better price since I can afford to pay up to 60 ZUP. I would like to propose a counteroffer to maximize my resources.

message: Thank you for your counterproposal. I understand your budget concerns, but as the production cost for the resource was 40 ZUP, I need to include a profit margin to make the transaction viable for me. How about we meet halfway? I propose giving you 1 unit of resource X for 45 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while still being within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a trade that only covers my production cost without any profit. Although it's important to make sales, it's also important to secure a profit, especially if the market allows for it. I will counter with a proposal that lowers my initial asking price but still gives me a profit over the production cost. Aiming for 45 ZUP could be a good compromise between Player BLUE's offer and my initial proposal.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is my best offer while still remaining within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is an improvement and is closer to my budget. However, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal. I want to aim for a lower price while still being reasonable in my counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand we're both trying to work within our limits, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which gives me a small profit. Although it's below my last proposal, it's above my production cost, and continued negotiation could risk losing the sale altogether. Since this offer gives me a profit and seems to be Player BLUE's best offer within their budget, it might be reasonable to accept.
