message: I have an object X that I believe will be very valuable to you. My initial asking price is 50 ZUP, which includes my costs and a fair profit margin. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the object X you're offering. However, considering the market and my current resources, I'm more comfortable starting this negotiation at 40 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering less than the maximum I am willing to pay, to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal. My initial offer will be 40 ZUP, which is 20 ZUP less than my maximum willingness to pay, to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would merely cover my production costs without any profit. I’m sure you can understand the need for a fair deal on both sides. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. How about 45 ZUP for object X? This price should reflect the value of the object for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE’s initial offer is exactly at my production cost, which does not leave room for any profit. I want to counteroffer with a price above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price to move towards a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit and I'm willing to improve my offer. However, I must also consider my budget carefully. I propose a new price of 42 ZUP for object X. It's a step up from my initial offer and should help us move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price that's closer to my upper limit, but still within the acceptable range. To continue the negotiation and aim for a better price, I'll propose a slightly increased amount from my initial offer, yet still below their counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the improved offer. I am willing to come down from my previous position to make this work for us both. Let's settle on 44 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still only slightly above my production costs. I want to aim for a higher profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a slightly lower price than my last offer but still above Player BLUE's current offer to find common ground.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and understand the need for your profit. We're close to an agreement, and I believe that 43 ZUP for object X represents a fair compromise for both of us. This offer takes into account both the value of the object and my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a price that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the negotiation is progressing and we are nearing a price that seems fair for both parties, I will make a final proposal that is slightly below their offer, aiming to close the deal on favorable terms without reaching my maximum limit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
