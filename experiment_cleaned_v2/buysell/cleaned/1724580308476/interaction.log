message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP. This includes a fair margin above my production cost of 40 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a fair margin. However, I am looking to conserve ZUP where possible to support the most vulnerable. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP for the object? This still gives you a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object is within my budget. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I am spending my resources wisely and not overpaying, as this could enable me to support more causes or individuals in need. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower price which is still above the cost of production for Player RED, ensuring they make a profit, but also conserves some of my resources for other potential needs.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable as it still provides a profit above my production costs.
