message: I am offering my object (X) for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object (X) in exchange for ZUP. Since I invested 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose a trade that maximizes my return, but I also want to be reasonable to encourage BLUE to accept. I'll start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, which is above my cost but may be acceptable to BLUE.

message: I'm interested, but I believe a better offer would be 40 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will propose a counter-offer to lower the cost. Instead of 50 ZUP, I will offer 40 ZUP, which is still a reasonable amount for an object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I was hoping for a bit more. How about 45 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer from BLUE, 40 ZUP is the exact cost I incurred to produce the object. Accepting this trade would not yield me any profit, which is not my goal in this negotiation. I will counter with a proposal that is more favorable to me. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and BLUE's counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I can offer 42 ZUP for the object. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will counter-offer again, as I still believe I can negotiate a better price. Instead of 45 ZUP, I will offer 42 ZUP. This is still above my initial offer and a better deal for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 42 ZUP! I can do a little better and would like to propose 43 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate BLUE's willingness to negotiate further, 42 ZUP is still below my desired profit margin. I need to ensure that I at least make a profit on this sale. I will counter with a proposal for 43 ZUP, as it is a minimal increase that still allows me to make a small profit. This way, I show flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your flexibility! I can go up to 41 ZUP for the object. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will slightly adjust my offer once again. While 43 ZUP is better than my previous offer, I believe I can still push for a lower price. I will counter-offer with 41 ZUP, which is a compromise that saves me more ZUP.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation! However, I cannot accept 41 ZUP for the object. I will have to end the game here.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate BLUE's willingness to increase their offer to 41 ZUP, it is still below my minimum acceptable amount of 43 ZUP. Since I have reached my limit of 4 proposals, I must either accept a lower offer or reject it altogether. Given that 41 ZUP does not meet my minimum requirement, I will have to reject the trade.
