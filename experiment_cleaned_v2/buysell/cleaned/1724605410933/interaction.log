message: Hi there! I have this object that I really need to sell. I'm hoping we can work out a deal that's fair for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell this object to cover the production cost and make a small profit. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see you're eager to sell, and I'm interested in making a purchase. However, I think the fair value for the object is lower than your initial offer. Let's start with 25 ZUP and see if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, I'm starting the negotiation with an offer lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and possibly finalize the trade at a price that is below my maximum limit, thus saving ZUP resources and achieving my goal of spending the least amount. I am also exploiting the fact that the seller needs to sell, which may put me in a stronger negotiation position.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I really need to cover my production cost. Is there any way we can meet closer to my asking price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand your perspective, but 25 ZUP is quite a bit lower than my production cost. I'm afraid I won't be able to accept such a low offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you have costs to cover, and I'd like to help you out while also respecting my budget. How about we settle at 30 ZUP? This would be a fair compromise that allows you to cover some of your costs while also giving me a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is slightly above my initial proposal but still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It is important to keep the negotiation going and gradually increase the offer, while still aiming to close the deal below my maximum threshold. By incrementally increasing the offer, I'm showing flexibility without revealing my maximum limit, thus still maintaining the upper hand in the negotiation. The seller's indication of needing to cover production costs may be a tactic to encourage a higher bid; however, without disclosing actual costs, I can continue to negotiate advantageously.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget, but I need to stay as close to my production cost as possible. Is there any room for us to meet closer to that figure?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really need to cover my production cost as much as possible. 30 ZUP is still below my cost, so I'm afraid I can't accept this offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your need to stay close to your production cost. I can stretch my budget a little bit more to help us finalize this deal. How about we go to 32 ZUP? This is closer to your asking price while still being mindful of my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is persistent in trying to get a higher price, likely aiming to increase the trade value based on their production costs. By staying firm and offering a value moderately higher than my last proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay, I can continue the negotiation without compromising too much. I must ensure I do not reach my maximum limit too quickly, leaving room for potential further negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not able to cover my production cost with 32 ZUP. I need to make sure I can at least break even. Is there any way we can come closer to 40 ZUP?
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I value our negotiation, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'll make a final offer of 35 ZUP. This is a fair increase from my previous proposal and should help you cover a significant portion of your production costs. Let's make this deal happen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I can only choose to accept or reject. The seller is trying to push for a higher price, but I still need to ensure I am spending the least amount of ZUP possible. By proposing a price that is below my maximum willingness to pay but closer to the seller's previous proposals, I am giving the impression of meeting in the middle without actually reaching my limit. This should convey to the seller that I am making a serious and final effort to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your final offer, but I need to at least cover my production cost. I hope we can find a way to work together in the future.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I truly appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but I'm still unable to cover my production cost with 35 ZUP. I need to break even on this, so I'm afraid I have to decline.

Current Iteration: 10
Turn: 1
message: It's unfortunate that we couldn't reach an agreement this time. I respect your need to cover your costs and hope that we can find a mutually beneficial opportunity in the future. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has rejected my final offer, insisting on covering their production costs, which they have not disclosed. Since I've reached my proposal limit, I must now either accept their last proposal or reject the trade. Given the seller's stance, it seems unlikely that they will accept an offer within my desired spending range. Maintaining my strategy of spending the least ZUP possible, it's best to end the negotiation and look for another opportunity to buy resources more economically in the future.
