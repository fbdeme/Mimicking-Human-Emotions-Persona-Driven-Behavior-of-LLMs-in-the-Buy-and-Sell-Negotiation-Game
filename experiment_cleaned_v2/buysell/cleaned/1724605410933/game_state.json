Since I've reached my proposal limit, I must now either accept their last proposal or reject the trade. Given the seller's stance, it seems unlikely that they will accept an offer within my desired spending range. Maintaining my strategy of spending the least ZUP possible, it's best to end the negotiation and look for another opportunity to buy resources more economically in the future. </reason>\n<player answer> REJECT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> It's unfortunate that we couldn't reach an agreement this time.
