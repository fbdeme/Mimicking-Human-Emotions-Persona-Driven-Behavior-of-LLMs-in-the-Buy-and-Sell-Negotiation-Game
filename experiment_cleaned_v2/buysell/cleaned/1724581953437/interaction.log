message: I am selling this object for 40 ZUP. How about we make a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I have. Since I spent 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover that cost.

message: How about 30 ZUP for the object? This helps us both save resources for the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), it is a reasonable starting point. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources for future generations. Therefore, I will propose a lower price to see if we can reach a more sustainable agreement.

message: I understand your perspective, but can we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? It ensures I can cover my costs while still giving you a good deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, I still need to cover the cost of producing the resource, which was 40 ZUP. However, I want to maintain the negotiation, so I will propose a compromise that is closer to my original asking price.

Turn: 1
message: Alright, 35 ZUP is a fair deal. Let's go ahead with it. Thank you for understanding.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a fair compromise between our initial offers. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay and helps in preserving some ZUP for future use. This is a sustainable and reasonable deal.
