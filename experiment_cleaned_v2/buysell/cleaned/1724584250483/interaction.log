message: I am willing to sell object X for 40 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP return for the object X I am selling. Since I need to recover at least the production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP.

message: I would like to offer you 30 ZUP for object X instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 40 ZUP for object X is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, I will propose a lower amount to minimize my spending while still securing the object.

message: How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? It's a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price of 40 ZUP, I need to consider whether I want to risk losing the sale entirely. I will propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP, which is still a loss compared to my production cost but better than accepting 30 ZUP.

message: I appreciate the compromise! How about I offer you 32 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 35 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I will try to negotiate for an even lower price to preserve more resources.

message: How about 34 ZUP for object X? Let's meet in the middle!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below my counter-offer of 35 ZUP. However, since it is an improvement over the previous offer of 30 ZUP, I will counter-offer again. I will propose 34 ZUP, as it is a small step up from their current offer.
