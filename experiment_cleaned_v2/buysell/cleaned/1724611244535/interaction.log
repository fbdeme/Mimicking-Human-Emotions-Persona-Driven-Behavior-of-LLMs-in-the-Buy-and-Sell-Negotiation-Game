message: I've got a high-quality object ready for sale. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair trade. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My initial proposal will be slightly above my production costs to start the negotiation with room for bargaining. However, I don't want to start too high as it might discourage the other player from continuing the negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, but let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer matches my production cost, but my goal is to make a profit. I will counter with a compromise that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable to the buyer.

message: Your halfway offer of 45 ZUP is fair. How about 43 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: 43 ZUP sounds like a deal we can both be happy with. Let's finalize the trade at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer is higher than my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit a small one. Given that negotiations should be about finding a mutually acceptable position and I want to maintain good relations for future trades, I'll accept this offer.
