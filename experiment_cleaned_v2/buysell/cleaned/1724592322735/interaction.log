Turn: 1
message: I am interested in your object X and would like to propose a trade where I give you 50 ZUP in exchange for it. I believe this offer is fair and aligns with the greater good by ensuring a balanced transaction between us. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am focused on the greater good and willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, offering 50 ZUP is a good starting point that allows room for negotiation while also being fair to both parties. This initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay and could be beneficial to Player RED if they value the object at less than 50 ZUP.
