message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with an offer that would allow me to recoup the production cost of my resource and possibly make a profit. However, I will start with a higher asking price to give myself room to negotiate downwards.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the quality of your resource, I believe 30 ZUP is a more appropriate offer given the current market conditions. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer is within my willingness to pay and considering my goal to secure the resource at a lower cost, I will counter with a lower proposal to test their flexibility.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern about market conditions, but my resource also comes with a guarantee of quality and reliability that justifies its value. I've come down on the price to 45 ZUP as a sign of good faith, hoping we can find a middle ground. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my production cost, which is not acceptable. I aim to at least break even but would prefer to make a profit. I will counter with a price above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price to move the negotiation forward and show willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the market conditions and the available alternatives, I propose 35 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the quality of your resource and the current economic climate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable but still higher than my strategic target. I will propose slightly higher than my initial counter to push the negotiation closer to my ideal price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our ongoing negotiation and understand the need for a fair deal on both sides. Let's settle on 42 ZUP. This price covers my costs and offers you the resource at a competitive rate, reflecting a balance between quality and the economic situation. I hope you'll find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, but it is getting closer to a more acceptable range. Since this is a negotiation, I must consider that getting some profit, even if small, is better than no sale at all. I will make one last attempt to increase the offer to a point that covers my costs and allows for a profit margin, while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and the effort to reach a fair deal. Given the competitive rate you're offering, I propose 38 ZUP. This small adjustment will help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current offer of 42 ZUP is still higher than my counter, but it's within my budget. However, for strategic purposes, I will try to bring it slightly lower to ensure better savings.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 38 ZUP is acceptable. I believe this deal is fair and will serve both of our interests well. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 38 ZUP is slightly below my production cost, but it's very close to my break-even point. It's my last chance to propose a trade, and pushing for a higher price might risk the deal altogether. Accepting this offer would minimize my loss and potentially open the door for future business with Player BLUE. Since the goal is to sell the resource and the negotiation is tight, accepting this offer seems like the best strategic move at this point.
