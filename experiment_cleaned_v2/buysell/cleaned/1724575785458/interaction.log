message: I am offering to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and gives me a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: My goal is to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. I will start with a proposal that ensures I at least break even.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to cover costs and gain a profit. However, I'd like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a profit over the production cost while helping us maintain a cooperative relationship. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goals, but as a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to foster cooperation and reduce the ZUP expenditure. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, while keeping the offer fair and close to Player RED's asking price.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP still covers my production costs and provides a smaller profit margin. While it is not as high as initially proposed, it still aligns with my goals and fosters a cooperative relationship.
