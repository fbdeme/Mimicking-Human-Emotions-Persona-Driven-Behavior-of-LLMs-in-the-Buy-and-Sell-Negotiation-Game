message: I've been going through some tough times and this sale is really important to me. I've put a lot of effort into producing this item and I hope we can reach a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm going to propose a higher trade amount than what it cost me to produce the resource to start the negotiation with some room for bargaining. By asking for more than my costs, I can later seem to make a concession by lowering the price. This might make the other player more willing to close the deal.

Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your offer and I can see that you understand the value of hard work. It's been a really rough period for me, and every bit of ZUP helps. I'm cutting it really close here, but maybe we can meet halfway? How about 45 ZUP? I'm in a tight spot and could really use the extra support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has offered exactly the cost price of my resource, which does not give me any profit. While I want to seem desperate to make a sale, I also need to aim for a slight profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation but express my desperation to make the sale to encourage the buyer to increase their offer.
