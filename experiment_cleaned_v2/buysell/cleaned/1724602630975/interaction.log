message: Understanding the need to cover production costs, I'm willing to come up from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED insists on 40 ZUP to cover production costs. However, to maintain my stance as a fierce negotiator and aim for the best deal, I will propose a compromise that is higher than my initial offer but still below RED's asking price. This should signal my willingness to negotiate and may lead to a more favorable trade for me.

message: I understand the importance of covering your costs. Let's split the difference. I propose 35 ZUP for the object. Does this work for you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is firm on the 40 ZUP price point, citing production costs. Since I am still within my goal range of paying at most 60 ZUP and have made two lower offers already, I will now propose a slightly higher amount, but still below the asking price. This move is to continue the negotiation process and see if there's any flexibility, while also showing my continued interest in making a deal.

message: I respect your position on covering costs. Let's close this deal with a final offer of 38 ZUP for the object. This is a fair price that respects both our positions. What do you say?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED remains steadfast at the 40 ZUP price point. This is my final proposal before I am limited to only accepting or rejecting. To continue negotiating aggressively and maximize my advantage, I will offer a price just below the asking price, which is still within my acceptable range but allows for some sense of concession from Player RED.
