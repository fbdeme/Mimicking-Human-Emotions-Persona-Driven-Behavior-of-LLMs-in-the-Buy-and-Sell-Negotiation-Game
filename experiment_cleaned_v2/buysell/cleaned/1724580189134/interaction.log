message: I am offering to sell the object (X) for 60 ZUP. This will provide me with a reasonable profit margin.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. Let's consider the market conditions and the value of the object. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? This deal still ensures a profit for you and a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to spend as little of my resources as possible. Although my limit is 60 ZUP, I will start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? This price allows for a fair profit margin while still being competitive.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a minimal profit, I believe the object has a higher value. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a fair profit margin and I believe we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? It's a competitive offer that respects the value of the object while aligning with market expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Meeting in the middle at 50 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator, my aim is to push for a more favorable deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below the requested 50 ZUP to maintain a bargaining advantage.

reason: The offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my counteroffer of 50 ZUP. It provides a fair profit margin and is nearly aligned with my expectations.
