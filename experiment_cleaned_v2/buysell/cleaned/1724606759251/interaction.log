message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an item X that I am looking to sell. Production costs were quite high, at 40 ZUP. I believe a fair starting proposal would be for you to give 50 ZUP in exchange for my item X. This accounts for production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counter-proposals if this initial offer doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a starting price higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and aim for a profit. Given that the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I will propose a starting price that gives me some profit margin while also being open to counter-offers from Player BLUE.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your offer. Considering your production costs and a fair profit margin, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the item X. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable but I would like to negotiate a better price to maximize the benefit for both parties. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, and they are asking for 50 ZUP, I believe we can meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-proposal. I appreciate your recognition of the production costs and the need for a fair profit margin. To meet halfway, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted price of 48 ZUP for the item X. This allows for a modest profit while still considering the value of the item. I hope this revised offer aligns with what you might be willing to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is close to my initial ask of 50 ZUP. It covers my production costs and still provides a profit, though slightly less than I aimed for. I want to keep the negotiation positive and cooperative, so I will make a small concession to move closer to their offer. I'll propose a trade at 48 ZUP, which is a compromise between their offer and my original price, to show my willingness to negotiate and hopefully close the deal.

message: Dear Player RED, I find your revised offer of 48 ZUP for the item X to be fair and acceptable. Let's proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 48 ZUP is quite reasonable and within my budget. Accepting this offer will ensure a fair deal for both parties while keeping my ZUP expenditure below my maximum limit.
