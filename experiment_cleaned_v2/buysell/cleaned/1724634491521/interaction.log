Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting offer, considering the cost and the value it provides. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the game with an initial proposal that aims to cover the production costs and secure a profit. The starting price is set higher to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This takes into account my budget and the value I see in the object. I believe this is a fair counteroffer to open our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed a starting offer of 50 ZUP, I want to negotiate for a better deal in my favor, considering that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, and I'd like to propose meeting halfway at 47 ZUP. This price would fairly compensate the production costs and provide you with the value you're looking for in object X. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price, it is above the production cost which is favorable. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher price to reach a middle ground and maximize profit while still making the sale attractive for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway at 47 ZUP is a reasonable suggestion, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 46 ZUP. This would allow us to finalize the deal and still provide you with fair compensation for your costs. I think this could be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to negotiate it down slightly to conserve my resources. I'll counter with 46 ZUP to see if they are willing to compromise further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable to me. I'm happy we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal, which is a very small difference. It still covers the production costs and provides a reasonable profit. I believe accepting this offer would lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both parties without further prolonging negotiations.
