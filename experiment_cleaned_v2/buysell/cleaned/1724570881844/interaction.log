newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, 40 ZUP only covers my production costs and leaves no margin for profit. I propose 45 ZUP instead, which gives me a small but fair profit. Does that work for you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but how about I offer you 42 ZUP for the unit of X? This way, itâ€™s still a bit more than my last offer while providing you with some profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand that 45 ZUP is still more than my initial offer, it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate down further to maximize my savings while still providing you a profit. I will propose 42 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your revised offer. 42 ZUP is very close, but it leaves me with a very minimal profit. How about we settle at 44 ZUP? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP gives me a very minimal profit. I will counter with 44 ZUP, which is a small increase and should be agreeable.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
