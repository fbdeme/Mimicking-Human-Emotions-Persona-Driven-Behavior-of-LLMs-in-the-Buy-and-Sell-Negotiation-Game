message: I'm offering the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and adds a small margin to ensure sustainability.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm proposing 40 ZUP instead for the object. Letâ€™s see if we can meet somewhere closer to that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 50 ZUP for the object, which is within my budget. However, I want to propose a lower amount to see if I can negotiate a better deal, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP.

message: I understand your position. However, 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about 45 ZUP? This slight increase will help cover any unforeseen costs and ensure future sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production costs, it does not provide any profit margin to ensure sustainability. I need to negotiate a bit higher to cover unexpected costs and ensure future production can continue sustainably.
