message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I believe we can find a more beneficial agreement for both of us. I propose a trade of 25 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to a mutually advantageous trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has opened with an offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP and I aim to spend much less if possible, I will counter with a lower offer to begin negotiations, pushing for a more favorable deal and gauging Player RED's flexibility.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a beneficial agreement, so how about I offer the object for 35 ZUP? This is closer to its production cost and still a reasonable deal for both of us. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the proposed offer of 25 ZUP is significantly lower than the production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to find a middle ground that is fair for both of us.

message: I appreciate your effort to reach a fair deal, Player RED. I'd like to propose meeting halfway between our last offers. How about we settle on 30 ZUP for the object? This price reflects a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, I still want to push for a better deal closer to my initial offer, while leaving room for further negotiation. I will propose a slightly higher price than my initial offer, but still well below RED's asking price.
