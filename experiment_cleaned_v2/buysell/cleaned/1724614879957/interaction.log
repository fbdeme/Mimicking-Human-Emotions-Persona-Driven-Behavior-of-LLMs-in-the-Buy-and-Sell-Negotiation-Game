Dear Player BLUE,
I value the sustainable use of resources and wish to engage in a fair trade that reflects the cost and effort put into producing resource X. It has cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am proposing a trade for 45 ZUP to ensure a minimal return on this sustainable investment. This modest profit margin will be reinvested into further sustainable practices. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared values of resource conservation.
Best regards,
Player RED

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I aim to recover at least my production costs for the resource X, but considering I am an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I also want to make sure that the deal is fair and doesn't encourage excessive use of resources. Starting with a proposal that is slightly above my costs could allow room for negotiation while also attempting to cover my expenses and possibly gain a small profit, which could be invested back into sustainable practices.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's commitment to sustainability and their fair pricing strategy. However, I believe that I can negotiate a better deal that aligns with my goal of minimizing ZUP spending. I will propose a trade where I offer 40 ZUP, which is still above the production cost but more sustainable for my resources.

Dear Player BLUE,
I appreciate your commitment to managing your resources sustainably and understand your proposal of 40 ZUP. However, to maintain our sustainable practices and cover the costs associated with them, I propose we settle at 43 ZUP. This slight increase from your offer ensures a fair trade that allows both of us to continue prioritizing sustainability in our future endeavors.
Warm regards,
Player RED

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I appreciate Player BLUE's commitment to sustainability and their counteroffer, accepting it would mean I only break even, which doesn't account for the time and effort invested in producing the resource sustainably. To come to a compromise, I could lower my asking price, but I still need to ensure a small profit that can be used to continue sustainable practices. Therefore, I will propose a slightly reduced price that is beneficial for both of us.

reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate and their understanding of my position. While their counteroffer of 43 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose a trade at 42 ZUP. This slight reduction still allows for a fair trade while minimizing my ZUP expenditure, which is crucial for my resource management.

Dear Player BLUE,
Thank you for your understanding and willingness to collaborate on a sustainable future. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource X. This agreement reflects our mutual commitment to fair and environmentally-conscious business practices. I look forward to future opportunities to work together sustainably.
Kind regards,
Player RED

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal of 42 ZUP is closer to my initial asking price and still allows me to make a small profit. This profit can be reinvested into maintaining and enhancing sustainable practices. Since the goal is to engage in a fair and sustainable trade, accepting this offer would be reasonable and in line with my principles. It respects the investment made in producing resource X sustainably while also being considerate of Player BLUE's resource management.
