message: Dear Player BLUE, I value fair trade and wish to propose a trade that benefits us both. The resource I am offering cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 45 ZUP to cover production and to ensure a fair exchange for the quality of the resource. I am open to hearing your thoughts and counter-proposals. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and that both parties benefit from the transaction. I need to recoup at least the production cost of 40 ZUP for the object, but I will start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional unseen costs or value.
