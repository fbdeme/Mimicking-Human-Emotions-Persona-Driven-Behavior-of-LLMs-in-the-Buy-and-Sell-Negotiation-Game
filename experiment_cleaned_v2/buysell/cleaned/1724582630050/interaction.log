my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to help! However, I really need to recover some of my costs. Would you consider 25 ZUP instead? I promise it will be worth it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate, which is good. However, 20 ZUP is still too low for me considering my production cost. I will counter their offer with a slightly higher amount, while still appearing desperate in my tone.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your offer! I'm so close to covering my costs, could we possibly agree on 23 ZUP? I would really be grateful for your support!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 23 ZUP it is. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The difference between 22 and 23 ZUP is minimal, and the seller seems desperate to cover their costs. Agreeing to 23 ZUP will still be a good deal for me and strengthen my position as a negotiator.
