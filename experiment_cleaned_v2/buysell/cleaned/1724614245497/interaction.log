message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure you will find invaluable. Given the cost of production and the exceptional value it provides, I propose a trade where you will give me 60 ZUP for my resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start with a high asking price to anchor the negotiations in my favor, leaving room to negotiate down while still aiming to make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, I would like to offer you 50 ZUP for the resource instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay. I need to assess if the value of the resource justifies the cost. However, since I have not evaluated the quality yet, I will counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the quality and production cost, my resource is worth more. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal. I'm willing to go down to 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to counter with a slightly reduced price from my original ask to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to finalizing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable offer and I need to consider if the resource is worth the 55 ZUP. Since I am still within my budget, I will accept this trade as it allows me to acquire the resource without exceeding my limit.
