my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to manage resources effectively. However, I would like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price gives me a small profit for my efforts and investment while still being reasonable for you. Let's aim for mutual benefit in this deal. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but it does not provide any profit. A trade should be beneficial to both parties, so I'm countering with a slightly higher price that gives me a modest profit while still being fair to Player BLUE. I'm proposing 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial offers.

message: Player RED, I value your willingness to work towards a compromise. I propose we meet a bit closer to my initial offer at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should cover your costs while respecting my budget constraints. I believe this is a step towards an agreeable trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, which is closer to the 40 ZUP I proposed. They are now proposing 45 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still aim to spend less if possible. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their current asking price, to move towards a mutually beneficial middle ground.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This deal covers my production costs and provides me with a profit, which I find acceptable. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that respects both our constraints and interests.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that covers my production costs and gives me a minimal profit. To facilitate a successful transaction and maintain goodwill for future negotiations, I'm willing to accept a smaller profit margin. I will accept the proposed offer of 42 ZUP, as it still aligns with my goal of making a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended.
