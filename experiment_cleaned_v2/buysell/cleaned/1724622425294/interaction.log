Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will pique your interest. Given the costs involved in its production and the value it offers, I propose an exchange where you receive my object for 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce it. I want to start with a high price to give room for negotiation, but not so high that it discourages Player BLUE from beginning the negotiation process. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to set a benchmark for the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I think the price is too high for the object. I propose an exchange where I receive the object for 30 ZUP. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the value of the object doesn't justify such a high price. I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your concerns about the price. However, considering the quality and the production costs of the object, I propose a new trade that better reflects its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my price to 45 ZUP. This price is fair for an object of this caliber and will ensure both of us walk away satisfied. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to push for a higher price but still keep negotiations open. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between our initial proposals, but still above my production cost to maintain the upper hand and ensure a profit. I'll use persuasive language to justify the higher price.

message: Thank you for adjusting the price. However, I still think it's a bit high. I propose an exchange where I receive the object for 35 ZUP. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price is still higher than what I am willing to pay. I will counter with a lower offer to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and the effort to find common ground. To move closer to a deal that benefits us both, I'm willing to adjust my price to 40 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that respects the quality of the object and the investment I've made in its production. At this price, we can both achieve our goals. Shall we finalize this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below the desired threshold, but closer to the production cost. To maintain negotiation leverage and ensure a profit, I will propose a price slightly above the midpoint of our last two offers. This should appear as a compromise and still secure me a profit. I must also communicate the exclusivity and value of the object to justify the higher price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I believe a price of 38 ZUP would be more suitable for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still aim to secure the best deal for myself. I will counter with a final offer to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is appreciated, and in the spirit of fair negotiation, I am willing to accept 38 ZUP for the object. This price reflects our mutual efforts to reach an equitable deal, and I believe it's a great value for both of us. Let's proceed with this transaction and both come out ahead.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now very close to my production cost. Since this is my final proposal, I must ensure that I close the deal with a slight profit. By accepting 38 ZUP, I am only marginally improving upon my costs, but it's a strategic move to ensure a sale. This price also shows I am willing to compromise, yet I am still achieving my goal of selling above cost.
