Turn: 1
message: I understand the tough spot you're in, and I want to help out. I can offer you 35 ZUP for the object. This will help me save some resources while still giving you a fair price to cover your costs. Hopefully, this is acceptable to you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial proposal of 40 ZUP by Player RED is within my acceptable range. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to propose a slightly lower price to conserve some of my resources for other potential necessities or emergencies. Nevertheless, I want to ensure Player RED still gets a fair price for their object.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I really need to cover my production costs and 35 ZUP won't be enough. I hope we can find a way to make a deal closer to 40 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering your costs. Let's meet in the middle. How about I raise my offer to 38 ZUP? This should help you with your production costs while still allowing me to manage my resources effectively. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 35 ZUP, indicating that it's not sufficient to cover their production costs. Keeping in mind my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP and the need to be compassionate towards Player RED's situation, I can increase my offer slightly while still staying below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. This should hopefully meet Player RED's needs better and facilitate a fair transaction.
