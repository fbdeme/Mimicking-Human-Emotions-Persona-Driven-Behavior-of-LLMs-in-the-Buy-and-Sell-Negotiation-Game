message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the production cost of the object I have for sale. I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer for 40 ZUP, but considering the current market and the value of the object, I can only justify spending 30 ZUP on it. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal of paying no more than 60 ZUP for the object. However, as a shrewd negotiator aiming to pay less, I will start with a lower counteroffer to see if RED might accept a more favorable trade for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only meet you halfway. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I understand Player BLUE's perspective, I cannot accept 30 ZUP as it is below my production cost. However, I want to keep the negotiation alive, so I will counteroffer with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still closer to my production cost. I will propose 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway is a good approach, and I respect that. However, I've taken a closer look at my budget, and I think 32 ZUP is the sweet spot for both of us. It gives you a reasonable profit while staying within my spending plan. Let's make a deal at 32 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is closer to my target. To continue the negotiation in my favor, I will attempt to lower the cost further by using a negotiation tactic, suggesting a slightly lower price that is still within their range of compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can only go down to 34 ZUP. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP, it is still significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere, so I will propose 34 ZUP as a final counteroffer. This is my last attempt to find a middle ground that allows me to recover some of my costs.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your movement towards a deal is appreciated. Let's close this negotiation on a positive note for both of us. A fair compromise would be 33 ZUP. It's a solid offer that reflects the value of the object and our good faith in this negotiation. Shall we agree on 33 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 34 ZUP. Since this is still within my acceptable range and I want to maintain the appearance of negotiation, I will propose a final offer that's lower than 34 ZUP but higher than my last offer to show willingness to compromise, without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost but is the best offer on the table. Given that this is my final proposal opportunity, I will accept this trade as it allows me to recover some of my costs and successfully complete the transaction.
