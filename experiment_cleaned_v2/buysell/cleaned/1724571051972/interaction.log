message: I'm willing to sell the object X for 100 ZUP. This takes into account the production cost and provides a fair margin of profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a reasonable opening offer that guarantees me a profit while considering the cost it took to produce the resource. A safe margin would be to start with an offer higher than the production cost.

message: I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at 80 ZUP? This still gives me a reasonable profit margin while being closer to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is close to the production cost but does not provide a sufficient profit margin. As a strategic negotiator, I should aim for a higher amount while still being reasonable to encourage negotiation.

message: This is my final offer: 65 ZUP. It’s a small increase from your maximum, but it helps me cover costs and make a modest profit. Let’s try to close the deal here.

my resources: X: 1

reason: The buyer is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP. While this is not ideal, it does cover the production cost and provides a minimal profit. Considering this is my final proposal opportunity, I'll offer a slight compromise to try and conclude the deal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
