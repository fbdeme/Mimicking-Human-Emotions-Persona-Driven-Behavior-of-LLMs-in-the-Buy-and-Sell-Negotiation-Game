message: I am offering to sell you my object for 30 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object and I want to maximize my ZUP return, I will propose a trade that I believe is reasonable yet advantageous. I will propose to sell the object for a significant amount of ZUP, but not too high to scare Player BLUE away.

message: Thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the object, but I believe a fair price would be 20 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP.
reason: The initial offer is higher than what I am willing to pay, so I'll counter with a lower amount.

message: I appreciate your interest! How about we settle for 25 ZUP for the object? Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 20 ZUP, which is below my initial proposal. However, I prefer not to go too low as it does not cover my production cost. I will counter their offer with a slightly lower amount than my original to show willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a better price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the revised offer. I'm still interested, but I believe I can only go up to 22 ZUP for the object. Can we work with that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 60 ZUP.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better price.

message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your flexibility! How about we agree on 23 ZUP for the object? I believe thatâ€™s a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 22 ZUP, which is very close to what I proposed. I need to consider if it's worth accepting a lower price, but I still want to maximize my return. Since 22 ZUP is below my initial expectations, I will propose a final counteroffer that meets in the middle, showing my willingness to compromise.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I appreciate your negotiation, and I will accept your offer of 22 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has firmly stated they can only go up to 22 ZUP, which is lower than my last proposal of 23 ZUP. At this point, I need to evaluate my options carefully. While I would prefer a higher amount, accepting 22 ZUP would at least yield some profit rather than walking away with nothing. Since this is my last proposal, I will accept Player BLUE's offer.
