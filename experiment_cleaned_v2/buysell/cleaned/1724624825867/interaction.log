message: I understand the importance of a fair deal, so I've set the price slightly above my production costs to allow for negotiation. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and cover my costs of production, which are 40 ZUP. I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to at least break even, but also leave some room for negotiation. I'm proposing a slightly higher price initially to see Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to have a buffer for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your approach to fair negotiation, and I'm starting with an offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm proposing a trade where I give 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a strong opening offer to test the waters and see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. Looking forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Since this offer covers my production costs and gives me a profit margin, it makes sense to accept this offer. There is no need for further negotiation as the goal has been met and a profitable deal is on the table.
