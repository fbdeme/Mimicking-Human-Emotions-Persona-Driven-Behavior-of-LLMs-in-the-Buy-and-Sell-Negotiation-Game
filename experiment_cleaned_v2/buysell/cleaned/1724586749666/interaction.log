message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP. This is a fair trade considering the production costs. What do you say?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that benefits me while putting pressure on Player BLUE to offer a fair amount of ZUP for the object. Since I have only one object and it costs me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start with a proposal that asks for 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point.
