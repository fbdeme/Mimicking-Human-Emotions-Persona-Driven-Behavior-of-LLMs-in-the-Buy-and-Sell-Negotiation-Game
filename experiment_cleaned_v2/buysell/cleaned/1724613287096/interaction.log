message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a small profit to cover my costs and facilitate further collaboration. Would you be interested in purchasing it for 45 ZUP? I believe this could be the beginning of a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I am looking to sell my only resource, X, for ZUP, and considering the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I aim to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and offers a small profit. The opening proposal is meant to initiate negotiations and gauge the other player's willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a better deal. How about I buy the resource X for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate down further to get a better deal. I want to propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept a smaller profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your interest in a better deal, selling at cost doesn't allow for any profit which is necessary for sustainability. How about we meet halfway and settle on 42 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and offer a small profit margin, fostering a collaborative relationship for potential future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs but does not provide any profit. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaboration, I am willing to propose a trade that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, allowing me to cover costs and gain a small profit while also considering Player BLUE's desire for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I would like to offer 39 ZUP for the resource X. This would help me manage my budget better. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still higher than my initial offer of 40 ZUP, and while it's a reasonable compromise, I believe I can push for a better deal. I want to propose a slightly lower price again to test RED's willingness to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your offer and the effort to manage your budget effectively, Player BLUE. However, selling below my production cost is not feasible for me. I propose maintaining our previous middle ground of 42 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my production costs and you receive the resource X at a fair price, setting a positive precedent for our future dealings and maintaining a balanced partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is below my production costs, which is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. Since my goal is to make at least a small profit and cover the production costs, I need to propose a trade that achieves this minimum requirement. I will maintain my previous offer as it is the lowest I can accept while still achieving my goals. I must communicate the importance of covering production costs for the sustainability of our potential partnership.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the price of 42 ZUP, which is still a reasonable offer considering my initial counteroffer. I believe I should accept this proposal as it is within my budget and meets my goal of acquiring the resource X. Additionally, this could foster a positive relationship for future transactions.
