message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that covers my production cost while also being attractive to Player BLUE. Offering a trade for a reasonable amount of ZUP makes sense to facilitate this exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for object X, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP instead. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, which is a reasonable deal. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP to attempt to lower the cost.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I can meet you halfway at 35 ZUP for object X. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I am willing to negotiate to make the trade happen. Therefore, I will counter with a proposal that is still below my cost, but closer to it, to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over my last proposal of 30 ZUP. It is still within my budget as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. I will accept this offer since it is a fair compromise.
