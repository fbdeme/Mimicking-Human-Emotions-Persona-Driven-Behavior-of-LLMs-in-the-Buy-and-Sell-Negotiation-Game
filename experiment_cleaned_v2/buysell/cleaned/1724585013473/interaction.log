message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the trade by offering my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP. Since X costed 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose selling it for 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better deal. How about I buy the object X for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay. I see an opportunity to negotiate a better deal. I will counteroffer with a proposal for a lower price while still keeping the transaction alive.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I would like to propose selling the object X for 35 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is still below the cost price of 40 ZUP that I spent to produce the object X. I will counter with a proposal that is more favorable to me, but still lower than my initial offer, to encourage a trade. I will propose to sell the object X for 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal! I can meet you halfway at 32 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still higher than what I initially proposed. However, it's still a reasonable price, so I will make another attempt to negotiate further down to 32 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is closer to a reasonable compromise compared to my previous counteroffer. I will consider this trade as it allows me to recover some of my investment. Thus, I will accept this trade.
