message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking for a serious buyer willing to pay a premium for this exclusive item. I propose a trade where you give me 60 ZUP for my object X. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price that includes a profit margin on top of my production cost of 40 ZUP. I aim to assert dominance by setting a high initial price, expecting negotiation to bring the price to a more reasonable level while still ensuring a healthy profit.

message: I accept your offer for object X at 60 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for 60 ZUP, which is at the maximum I am willing to pay for the object X. The cost of the object to Player RED is 40 ZUP, meaning they make a profit. However, I am still getting a good deal since I value the object highly. I will accept this trade since it meets my goals.
