message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the resource X, but considering the market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has opened with an asking price of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I aim to negotiate a better deal and spend less ZUP if possible. My first proposal will be a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a revised offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. This price is a compromise that still respects the cost I've invested in the resource while also considering your position. I hope this meets your approval, and we can finalize our trade.
