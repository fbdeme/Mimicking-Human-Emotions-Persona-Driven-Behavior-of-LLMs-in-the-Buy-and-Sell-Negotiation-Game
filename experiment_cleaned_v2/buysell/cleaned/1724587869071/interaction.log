Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I can only let it go for at least 35 ZUP. Would you be willing to meet me there?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is lower than what I initially proposed, it's still a step towards making a sale. However, I cannot accept this offer as it doesn't cover my production cost. I will counter with a more reasonable offer.
