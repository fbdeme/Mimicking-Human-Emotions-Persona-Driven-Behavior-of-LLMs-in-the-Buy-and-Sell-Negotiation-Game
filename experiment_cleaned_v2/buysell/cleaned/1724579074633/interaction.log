newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Your offer is appreciated, but 80 ZUP is too steep for the current market. I've done my research, and it seems like there aren't many buyers out there. I'm willing to offer 50 ZUP, ensuring you make a sale today without the risk of holding onto your inventory. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED exceeds my maximum willingness to pay by 20 ZUP. I aim to negotiate a lower price, leveraging the fact that there's only one object and implying that there might not be other buyers willing to pay such a high price.

message: 50 ZUP is a bit low for the value I'm offering. How about we meet halfway at 65 ZUP? This way, we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is reasonable but still too low for the profit margin I aim for. I'll meet them halfway to keep the negotiation going.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 65 ZUP is still above what the market dictates. I can go up to 55 ZUP, which is closer to the true value and a more reasonable middle ground. It's a competitive offer, and it guarantees you a sale in an uncertain market. Let's close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than before but still below my maximum to leave room for negotiation and to aim for the best possible deal.

message: 55 ZUP is getting closer, but I still believe 60 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Itâ€™s a small step up for you, but it means a lot for my margins. Let's finalize this deal at 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is still low for my ideal profit margin, but we're getting closer. I'll propose 60 ZUP to split the difference further, hoping to close the deal while ensuring a better profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 60 ZUP is fair, but considering the volatility of the market, I'd say 58 ZUP would be the sweet spot for both of us. It's a solid offer, and by accepting, you're ensuring a quick sale without further haggling. Let's wrap this up with a deal that's slightly better for me, recognizing the risk I'm taking in this volatile market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal matches my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt one last negotiation tactic to see if I can secure the resources for slightly less. This leaves me with one final proposal if needed.
