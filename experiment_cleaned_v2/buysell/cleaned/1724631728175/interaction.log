message: Given the high quality and the demand for X, I think it's only fair to start our negotiations at a premium. I'm confident you'll see the value in this. What do you say to my initial proposal?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by setting a higher initial price to give room for negotiation. I'll aim to make a profit but also be prepared to go down to the production cost if necessary. By starting high, I can make Player BLUE think they're getting a better deal when I lower my price.

message: I appreciate the quality of X, but considering the market trends and my current budget constraints, I believe a more balanced trade would benefit us both. Let's consider a starting point that reflects both the quality of X and a fair market value. How does an offer of 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I intend to counter with a lower offer to start negotiations, aiming to reach a more favorable agreement closer to my target expenditure. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially create room for negotiation, expecting Player RED to counter-offer.

message: I understand your position on budget constraints, but let's not forget the exceptional value X brings to the table. I believe a fair compromise that reflects the quality of X and our interests would be a trade at 65 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I am confident it will meet your requirements while respecting the effort that went into producing X.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I want to push for a higher price to secure a profit. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial proposal but still above Player BLUE's offer to keep the negotiations moving and to test their upper limit.

Turn: 1
message: You make a compelling point regarding the value of X, and I'm willing to come closer to your asking price. However, I must stay within a reasonable budget to maintain my financial strategy. I propose a trade at 58 ZUP, which is a sincere move towards your position while also being mindful of my spending limits. Is this something you can work with?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay. However, it shows a willingness to negotiate. I should propose a value slightly higher than my intended maximum to leave room for final negotiation, aiming to close the deal as close to 60 ZUP as possible without revealing my maximum limit just yet.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer shows me that you are indeed serious about acquiring X. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement and considering the exceptional quality of X, I propose we meet at 62 ZUP. This is a modest adjustment from your offer and represents a significant move from my initial asking price. I believe this figure honors both our positions and allows us to finalize this transaction amicably.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to my target price range, but I still want to secure a higher profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price, but one that's still above their offer to keep the negotiation in my favor. I have to be cautious not to push too hard, as I want to close the deal profitably without losing the sale.
