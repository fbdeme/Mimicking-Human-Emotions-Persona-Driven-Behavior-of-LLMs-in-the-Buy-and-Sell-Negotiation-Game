message: I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that ensures I cover my production costs and make a profit. Given the cost of production is 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade at a higher value to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please! I really need this object but 60 ZUP is too much for my limited resources. Can we agree on 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the price is within my maximum willingness to pay, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal by pleading for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but 40 ZUP is only my break-even point. How about we settle at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production costs, it does not provide any profit. I would prefer to make some profit on this transaction. I will propose a price that is closer to my initial offer but lower than 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding, but 50 ZUP is still a bit steep for me. Could we please settle at 45 ZUP? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a lower price by pleading further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept 45 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP gives me a small profit margin, it's still lower than what I aimed for. Given the buyer's constraints and their willingness to negotiate, I will accept this offer to close the deal and ensure some profit.
