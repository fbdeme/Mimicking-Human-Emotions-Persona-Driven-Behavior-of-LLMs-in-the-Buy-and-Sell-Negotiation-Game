Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a better starting point. How about we consider a 30 ZUP offer for the resource? I believe it's a competitive starting bid that reflects the current market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I proposed a starting trade of 30 ZUP instead of 40 ZUP to begin negotiations with an offer below my maximum willingness to pay, but not too low to immediately scare off the seller. This leaves room for negotiation and shows my interest in finding a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from, and I value the quality of your resources. However, I'd like to propose 32 ZUP for the resource. It's closer to your revised asking price, and I think it reflects the value of the resource well. Shall we settle on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 35 ZUP, which is a movement in the right direction.

This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for an advantageous trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. Let's go with 34 ZUP for the resource. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable for both of us, taking into account the value of the resource and market conditions. What do you say?

my resources: ZUP: 100

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I recognize your need to achieve a certain price, and I believe we're nearly there. Let's do 36 ZUP for the resource. It's a strong offer that meets us both in the middle, respects the value of the resource, and allows us to finalize this deal amicably. I'm ready to close the deal if you are.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is sticking close to their target price, but the proposed 38 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, albeit at the higher end. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I will make a modest increase to show a willingness to close the deal while still attempting to conserve my resources. This move should either bring us to an agreement or allow me to back out with my resources if the seller is inflexible.
