my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on the sale of X. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price higher than my production cost to see how much Player BLUE is willing to offer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for X. Would you consider this amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is proposing to sell X for 80 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will need to propose a lower amount to attempt to negotiate a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP covers my production cost and provides a small profit, I believe there is room for more negotiation. I will propose a mid-point to see if I can get a better offer.

message: I understand your position, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for X. This is my final offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now offering X for 70 ZUP, which still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. I cannot accept this offer as it is still above my limit. I will propose one last time to stick to my initial offer of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 60 ZUP is your final offer, but would you consider 65 ZUP? It's just a small increase and would make a significant difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reiterated their final offer of 60 ZUP, which still provides a profit over my production cost. However, since this is a negotiation, I will make one last effort to increase the offer slightly.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I am still only able to offer 60 ZUP for X. I really hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now offering to sell X for 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer either, so I will propose my original offer of 60 ZUP again. I have only one proposal left.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has consistently offered 60 ZUP and indicated that it is their final offer. Given that 60 ZUP still provides a profit margin over my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is a reasonable deal to accept.
