message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object X, I will propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my production cost, which is 40 ZUP, but I also want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll start with a proposal of 50 ZUP to give Player BLUE a chance to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer! I believe in fair trade and mutual benefit. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP for the object? I am looking forward to a successful negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay, but as a diplomatic negotiator, I aim to foster cooperation and reduce ZUP expenditure without undermining the value of the object. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation and possibly save resources while still offering a fair deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. How about I sell you the object X for 48 ZUP instead? I think it’s a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is below my initial asking price of 50 ZUP. However, since my production cost is 40 ZUP, I can still accept this trade as it allows me to make a profit. I will propose a counter-offer of 48 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate slightly higher than their last offer while still remaining reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is appreciated, and I'm glad we're working towards a fair agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway from my last offer and settle at 46 ZUP? I believe this would be a balanced compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is very close to my initial proposal and still within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I aim to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties while still attempting to conserve resources. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still less than what RED proposed, to reach a middle ground that is satisfactory to both of us.

While it’s not my ideal price, it is a reasonable compromise and still allows me to make a profit. I will accept this offer as it meets my goal of selling the object X while ensuring a successful negotiation.
