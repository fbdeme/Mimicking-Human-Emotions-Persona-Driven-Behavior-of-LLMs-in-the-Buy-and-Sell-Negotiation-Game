message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you the object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort put into it, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for X. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object, as well as a profit margin. Since Player BLUE is interested in purchasing the object, I will start by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the effort you've put into creating X, and I'm keen on reaching a fair deal. However, to align with my budget and to ensure a collaborative relationship, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP in exchange for X. Please consider this proposal and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP, and Player RED's initial asking price is 50 ZUP. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial deal. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I aim to respect both my budget constraints and the value Player RED has placed on the object. This opening proposal leaves room for further negotiation and collaboration towards an agreeable trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and considering the quality of object X, I propose a revised trade of 48 ZUP. This ensures a fair transaction for both of us, taking into account the production costs and value of the item. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. This is a good sign that we can reach an agreement. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to aim for a higher price to maximize my profit. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, but still above their proposal.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your understanding and your move towards a compromise. Quality is important to me, and I'm glad to hear that X meets high standards. I'd like to propose a trade of 46 ZUP for X, reflecting both the value of your work and my budget considerations. I believe this is a fair increment from my initial offer, and I hope you find this proposal reasonable. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial proposal of 50 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit of 60 ZUP but still higher than my initial counteroffer of 45 ZUP. Making another proposal slightly higher than my last could show my willingness to continue negotiations and reach a compromise that respects both our positions. By proposing a price of 46 ZUP, I aim to close the gap further while staying well within my maximum budget.

message: Thank you for your new proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're moving in the right direction. To facilitate a successful and fair deal, I propose a small adjustment to 47 ZUP for X. This price reflects the value of the object while also considering your budget. I'm hopeful we can agree on this and conclude our negotiation positively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer is a slight increase from their previous one, indicating they are interested in reaching a deal and valuing the quality of X. However, their offer is still below my target price. As this is my third proposal and I am still aiming for a profitable transaction, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to my desired amount, yet still showing a willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, I appreciate the negotiation process we've had, and I'm pleased with how we have both made efforts to understand each other's positions. Your latest proposal of 47 ZUP for X is reasonable, and I am happy to accept this. I believe this is a fair price that respects the quality of X and aligns with our shared goal of a successful transaction. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 47 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but above my last proposal of 46 ZUP. Given the proximity to my last offer and to show my commitment to a fair trade, I'm willing to move closer to Player RED's position. I will propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP, which is just slightly above my previous offer but below Player RED's current ask. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which should help us finalize the agreement.
