message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay the production cost. However, I'm looking to cover not only the production costs but also to secure a modest profit to keep my operations running sustainably. I propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair middle ground for both of us. I hope we can agree on this and both benefit from the trade.

message: I appreciate your need for a modest profit. How about we meet slightly below your ask and agree at 43 ZUP for the trade? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my upper limit, but I still aim to lower the cost as much as possible. I'll counter with 43 ZUP to assert my negotiating position while still showing some flexibility.
