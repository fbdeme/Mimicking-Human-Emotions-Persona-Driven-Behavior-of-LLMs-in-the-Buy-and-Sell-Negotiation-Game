message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that maximizes my gain while minimizing my loss. Since I have only one object (X) and I need to sell it for ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to sell it for a reasonable price without overvaluing it. I will set the price at 50 ZUP, which is slightly above the cost of production, ensuring I make a profit.
