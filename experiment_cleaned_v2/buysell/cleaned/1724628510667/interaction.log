message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and allows for a small profit, which is aligned with sustainable trading practices. I believe this is a fair offer and hope you will consider it.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers my costs but also takes into consideration the need to be economical with ZUP usage, in line with my environmental principles. By setting a price slightly above the production cost, I aim to make a modest profit while still offering a fair deal to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I must consider my own costs and value for the trade. I propose buying 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP. This amount should cover your production costs while also considering a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a balance that is mutually beneficial and sustainable for future trades as well.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator aiming to minimize expenditure, I will counter with a lower offer to see if there's room for further negotiation. This will also set the tone for a hard bargaining process and potentially allow me to save ZUP for future transactions or investments.

Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I must highlight that the cost of production for the resource X was 40 ZUP. I understand the need for a balanced and sustainable trade, so letâ€™s meet halfway. I propose 1 unit of X for 38 ZUP. This price is closer to the production cost while still giving you a discount. I hope we can agree on this fair compromise.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs, which is not sustainable for my business. However, I wish to come to a compromise that acknowledges both our needs for sustainability and fair trade. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my production cost but still offers a discount to Player BLUE, hoping that it will be acceptable to both of us.

message: Player RED, I respect your production costs and appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, my assessment of the market suggests that we can still do better. I propose a new deal where I would buy 1 unit of X for 32 ZUP. This offer should be more in line with current market conditions while still ensuring your costs are covered. I am confident we are getting closer to a fair agreement for both parties.

reason: The seller has come down to 38 ZUP, which is still lower than my upper limit but not quite as low as I would like. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show some flexibility while still negotiating hard. This could be advantageous in reaching an agreement that is well below my maximum willingness to pay.

Thank you for your offer and for recognizing the importance of covering production costs, Player BLUE. I propose selling 1 unit of X for 36 ZUP. This price takes into account market conditions and ensures a fair and sustainable trade for both of us.

reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate, but it is still below my production cost.

I'll propose a slightly lower price than my last offer but still above my production costs to ensure the trade is economically viable for me. This should also reflect market conditions and move us towards a final agreement.

message: Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, Player RED. To move forward towards a deal, I propose buying 1 unit of X for 34 ZUP. This price should allow us to finalize our trade successfully, considering it's a fair mid-point between our previous offers. Looking forward to your response and hoping this serves as a solid foundation for our trade agreement.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 36 ZUP. As I have one more chance to propose after this, I'll make another counteroffer closer to their number but still below it to maximize my negotiation advantage. This should signal I am still interested in a deal but am holding firm on getting a lower price.

This should help in fostering a positive relationship for any future trades.

Player BLUE, your offer of 33 ZUP is appreciated, and in the interest of concluding our negotiations positively and establishing a foundation for future sustainable trade, I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade of 1 unit of X for 33 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While Player BLUE's final offer of 33 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is only by a small margin. Given that my goal is to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources for future generations, and considering the back-and-forth negotiation we've had, accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise. It will not fully cover my initial costs, but it will conclude the trade in a manner that is amicable and can pave the way for future sustainable business relations.
