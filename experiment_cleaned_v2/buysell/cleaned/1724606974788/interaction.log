message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a modest margin to sustain the production of X, but I'm open to discussion to reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us. Let's work together for our mutual success!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a community-minded negotiator, my goal is to at least cover the costs of production to sustain the ability to produce more resources in the future. I also want to ensure that the trade is fair and reasonable, encouraging collective success without demanding excessive profit. I will start the negotiation at a slightly higher price than the cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. Considering your production cost of 40 ZUP, I propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This way, you cover your costs, and we can hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable, given that it covers their production cost and includes a profit margin. However, as Player BLUE, my goal is to spend less ZUP while still obtaining the object X. Since I have room to negotiate, I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to compromise.

message: Thank you for your willingness to cover the production costs, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of a fair and beneficial agreement. To ensure the sustainability of production and future availability of resources, I propose a slight increase to 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This small margin will support the community by allowing for reinvestment in the production process. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared goal of collective success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer to cover my production costs exactly. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I must ensure that the ongoing production of resources is sustainable. To do so, I need to incorporate a slight margin to reinvest in production and maintain healthy operations. I will counter with a price that is a compromise between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer, still providing a fair deal for both parties while ensuring the continuity of production.

message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal, Player RED. To further both of our goals, I propose a slight adjustment to 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer still covers your production costs while allowing for a smaller but still significant margin to support future production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal at 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It covers their production costs and allows for a small profit, which supports their reinvestment in production. Given that my upper limit is 60 ZUP, this offer is still within my acceptable range. However, it is prudent to attempt to negotiate further to achieve a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful proposal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This trade supports the sustainability of production and reflects our commitment to the community's collective success. I look forward to our continued collaboration in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counterproposal is reasonable and shows a willingness to ensure that I can maintain a sustainable production. By accepting 43 ZUP, I am still able to cover the production costs and have a small margin, which can be reinvested into maintaining the production of X. This aligns with my community-minded approach to ensure ongoing resource availability while fostering a spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit.
