Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm interested in the object you're selling. I'd like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP for it. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and reaching a fair agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My opening proposal is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which gives me room to negotiate and possibly reach an agreement that is below my maximum budget. Starting with 40 ZUP leaves space for adjustments based on the seller's response while aiming for a fair trade that considers the well-being of both parties.
