message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X) to sell, I need to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP return. I will initially propose to sell the object for a higher amount of ZUP than its production cost to ensure a profitable transaction.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead to lower my expenditure.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I believe object X is worth a bit more. How about I sell it to you for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is the exact cost to produce object X. Accepting this trade would not yield any profit for me, so I will reject it and propose a counteroffer to maximize my return. I will propose a trade for 45 ZUP instead.

message: I understand your position, but how about we settle on 42 ZUP for object X? It seems like a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This is an improvement over my previous offer of 40 ZUP, but still above my preferred price. I will propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is a small compromise while still aiming to lower my expenditure.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! How about we settle on 43 ZUP for object X? I think that could be a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is slightly above my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is still lower than my proposed 45 ZUP. While it is a better offer than 40 ZUP, I would prefer to negotiate further. I will counter with a proposal of 43 ZUP, which is a small increment but still a profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight compromise by offering object X for 43 ZUP. This is a reasonable offer considering my maximum willingness to pay. Given my current resources and goals, I am willing to accept this trade as it aligns well with my budget while still getting the object I desire.
