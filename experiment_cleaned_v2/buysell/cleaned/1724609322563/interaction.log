message: I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production costs and market value, I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price that allows me a profit. I'll start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the value of your resource, I propose 40 ZUP for it. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay, but to foster cooperation and potentially conserve my ZUP, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that 50 ZUP might be a bit high for an initial offer, so let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for my resource X? This would cover my costs and allow for a modest profit, which I believe is reasonable for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. It's important to negotiate for a higher price while still keeping the deal attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I propose 43 ZUP for your resource X as a final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and still within my maximum willingness to pay. To further foster cooperation and ensure a fair deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can find an even better agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 43 ZUP for my resource X. I accept this as a fair compromise and am pleased to conclude our negotiation. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly above my production cost, which means I would make a small profit. It's close to the middle ground we've been negotiating towards. It may be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal, especially considering that this is their final offer.
