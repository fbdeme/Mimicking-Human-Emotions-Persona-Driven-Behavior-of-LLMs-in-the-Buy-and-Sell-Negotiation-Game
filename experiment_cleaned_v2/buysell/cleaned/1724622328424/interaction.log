message: My dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm sure you will find most valuable. I have invested a significant amount in its production, and I believe that a fair trade would be 60 ZUP for this splendid item. Let's make a trade that's beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by setting a high price to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation. I aim to make a profit while also gauging Player BLUE's valuation of the resource. I will propose a trade for 60 ZUP, which is 50% above my production cost, to test Player BLUE's response and willingness to pay.
