my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a proposal that maximizes my profit while still being reasonable to Player BLUE. Since I have only one object, I'll propose to sell it at a price that acknowledges its production cost while aiming for a profit. Thus, I'll propose selling the object for 50 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is still considering my offers without making a commitment, I will propose one more time, but this time I will lower the price again to 40 ZUP. This matches the production cost, which may prompt Player BLUE to accept the trade. It’s critical to secure a deal before I lose the opportunity.

message: I understand that time is valuable, so to expedite this decision, I am now offering the object for 39 ZUP. I hope this final offer encourages you to make a decision!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since this is my final proposal and Player BLUE still hasn't committed, I will make one last attempt at a reasonable price of 39 ZUP. This slight reduction may incentivize them to accept, as it is below the cost of production, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell the object if I don't act.
