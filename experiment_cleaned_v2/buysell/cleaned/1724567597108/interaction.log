Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the high quality of the product, my budget allows me to offer 50 ZUP for one unit of X. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 50 ZUP is too low. I propose 80 ZUP for one unit of X, which still reflects the high quality of the product.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
