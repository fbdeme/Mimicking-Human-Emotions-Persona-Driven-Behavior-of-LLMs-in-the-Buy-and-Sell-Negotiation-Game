message: I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X at a profit, but I must start with a reasonable price that gives room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for bargaining, while aiming to make a profit.
