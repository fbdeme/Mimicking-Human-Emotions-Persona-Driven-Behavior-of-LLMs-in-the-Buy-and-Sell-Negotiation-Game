Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your situation, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for the object instead. This way, I can still accommodate your production costs while keeping my resources in check.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 45 ZUP seems reasonable since it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I need to negotiate to lower the price further to maximize my resources. I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP, which is still above the seller's cost while allowing me to save some ZUP.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP means I make no profit at all. I'm really in need of some profit to sustain my business. Could you please consider raising the offer to 50 ZUP? This would greatly help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer covers my production costs, it leaves me with no profit. I need to make a profit to sustain my business.

message: I appreciate your concerns regarding profit, but how about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object? This way, we can both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 50 ZUP is more favorable for the seller, but it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While I understand their need for profit, I believe I can negotiate further to secure a better deal. I will propose 45 ZUP again, as it aligns with my initial offer and might encourage them to accept it.

message: Player BLUE, I truly appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. How about we finalize the deal at 48 ZUP? This would provide me with a modest profit and ensure a fair exchange for both of us.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 48 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we could find a fair agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, and it is a reasonable compromise between both parties. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the object while also respecting the seller's need for profit. Given that I have only one proposal left, I will accept this trade.
