message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your starting offer. Considering the production cost and the value of the item, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the trade. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED's initial asking price is 50 ZUP and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I will propose a trade amount slightly lower than RED's asking price to leave room for negotiation and possibly reach a middle ground. This will also allow me to conserve some ZUP for future use or other transactions.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and adjusting your price to 48 ZUP, Player RED. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer. I propose 46 ZUP for object X, which I feel is a fair compromise for both of us. I am hopeful that this offer moves us closer to a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by reducing the price from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. To continue the negotiation in good faith and move closer to a mutually beneficial deal, I can increase my offer slightly above my initial proposal without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. This should signal my interest in reaching an agreement and also respect the value Player RED places on the item.

reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is within the range of my willingness to pay.

Accepting this offer also leaves room within my budget for other potential uses of my ZUP.
