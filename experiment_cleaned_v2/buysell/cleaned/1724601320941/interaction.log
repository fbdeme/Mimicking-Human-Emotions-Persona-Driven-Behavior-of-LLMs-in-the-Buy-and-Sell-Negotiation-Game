Turn: 1
message: I see you're starting the bid at 35 ZUP, which is a fair offer. However, considering the market conditions and the fact that I'm the only buyer you have at the moment, I believe a price of 30 ZUP would be more appropriate. It's a competitive offer, and I'm ready to close the deal quickly, saving you time and effort in finding other potential buyers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial proposal by Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay, I will try to negotiate for an even lower price by leveraging the fact that there's only one buyer, which is me. This may induce urgency in Player RED to make the sale, potentially accepting a lower offer.
