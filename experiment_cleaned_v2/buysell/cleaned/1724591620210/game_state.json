Since this is my third proposal, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to their asking price but still ensures I get a good deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I value our negotiation and am grateful for your flexibility.
