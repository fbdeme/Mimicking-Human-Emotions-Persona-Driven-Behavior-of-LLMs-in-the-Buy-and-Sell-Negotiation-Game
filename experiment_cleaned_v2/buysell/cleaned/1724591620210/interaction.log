Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm in a difficult situation right now, and I need to sell this object X to recover some of my losses. I hope you can understand my situation and consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to recover some of the costs I incurred while producing it. My production cost was 40 ZUP, and I am in a tight spot financially. I want to propose a trade that seems reasonable but also allows me to cover my costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're in a tight spot, and I'm willing to help you out. Let's start our negotiations at 30 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED seems to be in a difficult position and may be more willing to sell at a lower price. Starting the bid at 30 ZUP, which is half of my maximum willingness to pay, gives me room to negotiate upwards while still attempting to secure a good deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I hope we can settle on 35 ZUP for the object X. It's a bit closer to what I need to recover my losses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to help, but I still need to cover my production costs. While 30 ZUP is a generous offer, I can't afford to go that low. I want to propose a slightly higher amount that still reflects my desperation and need for assistance.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. To meet you partway, I'm willing to increase my offer to 32 ZUP for the object X. This should help us move closer to an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly higher amount of 35 ZUP. Since it's still below my maximum willingness to pay and the increment is small, I can counter with a slightly higher amount that's still advantageous for me, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to adjust your offer. I can accept 34 ZUP for the object X, which will help me cover my costs a bit better. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate further. However, 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, and I find myself in a challenging position. I want to propose one last counteroffer that is still reasonable given my needs while also considering your offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I value our negotiation and am grateful for your flexibility. To finalize our deal, I'm prepared to offer 33 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 34 ZUP, which is slightly above my last offer but still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to their asking price but still ensures I get a good deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and the effort you've made to reach this point. I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working with me on this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 33 ZUP, it still doesn't fully help me recover my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, given the circumstances and the effort we've both put into this negotiation, I am considering my options carefully. I recognize that this may be the best offer I will receive, so I will accept it.
