message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object X to sell, I will propose a trade that reflects its value and my production cost. I will aim to get a fair amount of ZUP that covers my cost while still being attractive to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade where I give 35 ZUP for the object X. This would allow us to make a fair trade that respects both our resources. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for X, which is within my willingness to pay. However, since we are encouraged to foster cooperation and reduce the ZUP expenditure, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations and see if there's room for an agreement on a more favorable trade.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept 35 ZUP as it does not cover my production costs. I would like to stick with my original proposal of 40 ZUP for the object X. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While it's a step towards negotiation, I cannot accept this offer. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my cost to ensure that I do not incur a loss.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns regarding production costs, Player RED. I am willing to accept your original proposal of 40 ZUP for the object X to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has declined the offer of 35 ZUP, stating it does not cover their production costs. They wish to stick to their original proposal of 40 ZUP for X. Since 40 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and Player RED's position on their production costs is taken into account, it is reasonable to accept this trade to ensure a successful negotiation and maintain a cooperative relationship.
