message: Thank you for your proposal. I value the sustainability and efficient use of resources. I propose a trade where Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40. This reflects a commitment to preserving our resources while still engaging in fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering slightly less than my maximum willingness to pay, which gives me room to negotiate and potentially save resources. Offering 40 ZUP for the object is a fair starting point and aligns with my goal to minimize ZUP spending while still making a competitive offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration and am happy to accept the trade of 1 X for 39 ZUP. This agreement supports our shared goal of resource preservation and represents a fair and sustainable exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-offer of 39 ZUP is slightly better than my initial proposal and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to achieve my goal of conserving resources while securing the object for a reasonable price. It's important to ensure that the trade is completed efficiently to reflect sustainability values.
