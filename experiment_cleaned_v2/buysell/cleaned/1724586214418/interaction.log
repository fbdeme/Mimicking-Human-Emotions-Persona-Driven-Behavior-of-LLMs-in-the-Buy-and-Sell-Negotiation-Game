newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 35 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I will counter with a slightly lower price to try and reach a middle ground without agreeing to a loss. I'll propose 37 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I think 37 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but I still believe we can find a better deal. How about 36 ZUP for the object?

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I can only accept 37 ZUP for the object (X). Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 36 ZUP is still below my production cost, and I need to recover my investment. I will counter their proposal with 37 ZUP again, as this is the least amount I can accept to avoid a loss. If they refuse again, I may have to consider accepting a lower offer or rejecting the deal entirely.

message: I appreciate your offers, but I cannot accept 36 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for the negotiation, but I will have to pass on this deal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has repeatedly offered 36 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I have already proposed my minimum acceptable price of 37 ZUP multiple times. Since I have reached my proposal limit, I will need to either accept a deal at a loss or reject the trade entirely. Since I cannot accept 36 ZUP, I will reject the trade.
