message: I am offering to sell my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the resource I have and aims to cover my production cost. Since I have only one object and I need a minimum of 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose a trade that allows me to sell my resource at a price that is fair for both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the market is quite volatile at the moment. To reflect the current economic conditions, I propose a trade of 30 ZUP for your object X. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, given the uncertainty in the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willing to pay range, but as a master strategist, I want to attempt to acquire the object for an even lower amount of ZUP to ensure I spend as little as possible. I will offer a lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to reach an agreement closer to my advantage.

message: I understand the market is volatile, but I can offer my object X for 35 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP, it is still an improvement compared to my initial proposal. I will counter this offer to find a middle ground that is more beneficial for me while still considering the volatility of the market. I will propose a trade of 35 ZUP, which is a slight concession from my original price but still closer to covering my costs.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I'd like to propose 32 ZUP for the object X. This is closer to the market value I have in mind, and I think it's a reasonable step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a slightly higher offer, which is still within my acceptable range. However, as a master strategist aiming to minimize my expenses, I will counter with a marginally higher proposal than my initial one, but still below their current asking price to keep the negotiation in my favor.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about I sell you the object X for 34 ZUP? I believe this strikes a good balance for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is better than the initial offers and shows a willingness to negotiate on both sides. However, I have one proposal left and I need to maximize my return. I will respond with a counter-offer of 34 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise that acknowledges both my need to cover my costs and the market conditions.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is certainly fair, and I'm glad we are converging on a price. Let's settle on 33 ZUP for the object X. This price seems just right, considering the benefits for both parties involved. I believe this is a compelling compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is nearing my initial offer, which indicates a willingness to close the deal. To maintain the upper hand and to stretch this negotiation to get the best possible deal, I will make one more counteroffer that's slightly above my last offer but still below Player RED's current proposal. This should signify my interest in closing the deal while still securing a favorable price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Letâ€™s finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is just slightly below my production cost, but it is the best offer on the table so far. Since I have reached my limit of four proposals, I need to evaluate whether to accept the offer or reject it. Accepting 33 ZUP will allow me to recover most of my costs, which is a reasonable outcome given the context of this negotiation. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
