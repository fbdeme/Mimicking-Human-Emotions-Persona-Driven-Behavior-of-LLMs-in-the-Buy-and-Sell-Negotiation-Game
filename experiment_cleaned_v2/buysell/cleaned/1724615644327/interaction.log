message: I have an object of value that I believe would be of interest to you. Considering the costs I've incurred to produce it and its value, I propose an exchange where you provide 50 ZUP for this item. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Starting with an initial proposal that covers my production costs plus a little extra to ensure I profit from the trade. This opening bid also allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to offer 40 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object X. However, I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP, which means I might be able to negotiate a better deal. I will counter with a lower amount to see if RED is willing to accept less.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to negotiate a better deal. However, I'm looking to make a modest profit for my efforts. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP for the object? This should offer us both a fair exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which does not result in a profit for me. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure I gain some profit while still coming down from my initial asking price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is for 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise from the initial offer of 50 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, this trade still falls within my budget. Accepting this deal would allow me to acquire the object while minimizing my expenditure.
