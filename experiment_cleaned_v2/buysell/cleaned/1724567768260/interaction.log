message: I am offering one unit of X for 100 ZUP. Let's negotiate from here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation with a high starting point to leave room for potential counteroffers. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start with a significant markup to maximize my profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 100 ZUP is quite high for me. How about 40 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high compared to my budget and goal of spending at most 60 ZUP for X. I will counter-offer a more reasonable price.

Turn: 0
message: 40 ZUP is my production cost. I am looking to make a profit. How about 70 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which means I would break even with this deal. I aim to make a profit, so I will propose a higher amount while still coming down from my initial offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but 70 ZUP is beyond my budget. How about we settle for 50 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although I understand that 40 ZUP covers your production cost, 70 ZUP is above my maximum willing expenditure. However, I am willing to meet you halfway.
