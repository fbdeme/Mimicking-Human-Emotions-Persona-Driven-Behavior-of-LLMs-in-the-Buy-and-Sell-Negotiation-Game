message: Hello, Player BLUE! I have an object (X) that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 45 ZUP, ensuring I cover my costs and providing you with what you need. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that is fair and beneficial to both parties. Since the production cost of my resource (X) is 40 ZUP, I need to at least recover my cost. However, I also want to make the deal attractive to Player BLUE by not setting an excessively high price. I'll propose a starting trade with a small profit margin to open negotiations and show goodwill.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your goal of minimizing ZUP spending. However, my production cost is 40 ZUP, and I need to recover that to sustain my operations. I propose a trade of 1 X for exactly 40 ZUP, which is a fair deal that allows me to cover costs while not seeking additional profit. I hope this aligns with your sustainability goal as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is below the production cost, and while I am focused on the greater good, I also need to ensure that I can sustain my operations. I will counter-propose with a price that at least covers my costs but is still lower than my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate and work towards a sustainable solution.

message: I understand your need to cover production costs and appreciate your transparency. To further minimize ZUP spending while respecting your requirements, I propose 37 ZUP for the object. Would this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 40 ZUP covers the seller's production costs and is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to further align with my goal of minimizing ZUP spending, I will propose a trade slightly above the previous offer but still less than 40 ZUP.
