message: I'm proposing to sell X for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a modest profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell X for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I need to ensure I at least cover that amount. However, considering the well-being of both parties, I will propose an initial price that offers a modest profit while being mindful of Player BLUE's resources.

message: Thank you for the offer! I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to finalizing the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), so I can accept this proposal as it is a fair price and meets my goal of acquiring the object.
