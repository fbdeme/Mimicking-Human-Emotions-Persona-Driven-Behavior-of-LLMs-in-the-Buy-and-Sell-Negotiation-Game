message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X for trade. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to sell it for a small profit. I propose offering you object X for 45 ZUP. I'm open to negotiations and want to ensure a fair deal that considers both of our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair. I need to recover at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP, but I should also consider the financial constraints of Player BLUE. Therefore, my initial proposal will be set slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation, ensuring that I can cover my costs while also being open to a reduction that may help Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your proposal of 45 ZUP for object X, but would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead? This would make the trade more appealing to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate for a lower price since the seller is looking for a small profit. I will propose a counteroffer to secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of making the trade appealing to you. Considering the production cost and the need for a sustainable trade, could we agree on 42 ZUP for object X? This allows me to cover costs and maintain a modest operation while also taking your position into account.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has requested to purchase the object X for exactly the production cost of 40 ZUP. As a compassionate negotiator, I understand the desire to minimize expenditure. However, I must also consider my own costs and the effort that went into producing the object. I will propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs fully and provide a minimal profit to ensure sustainability of my operations, which is also an act of compassion towards my own situation. I will reduce the price slightly but still above the cost to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, Player RED. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 42 ZUP is closer to my original counteroffer and is still within my budget. This price is reasonable considering I initially aimed for 40 ZUP. I will accept this trade, as it is a fair price and still allows me to stay within my spending limit.
