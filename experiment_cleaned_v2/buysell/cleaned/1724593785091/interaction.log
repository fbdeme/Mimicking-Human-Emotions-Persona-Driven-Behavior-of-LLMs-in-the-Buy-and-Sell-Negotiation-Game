my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Thank you for the offer, but I need to sell the resource for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production cost. I propose a trade of 1 X for 35 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed trade of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, making it unsustainable for me. I will counteroffer to continue negotiating.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept the trade of 1 X for 35 ZUP. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 35 ZUP is close to the initial proposal and provides a good balance between cost-saving and fairness. Given the seller's production cost, this seems reasonable.
