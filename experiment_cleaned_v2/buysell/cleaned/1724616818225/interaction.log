message: Dear Player BLUE, I offer you my exquisite object X, which is in high demand and has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you receive this object for 60 ZUP, ensuring a transaction that reflects its true value and rarity. I'm sure you understand the significance of acquiring such a coveted item. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I want to start with a high asking price to set the stage for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counter-offer. This also gives me room to decrease my asking price while still aiming for a profitable deal.
