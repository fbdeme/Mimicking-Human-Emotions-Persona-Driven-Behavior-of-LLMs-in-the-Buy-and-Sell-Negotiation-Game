message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am offering it to you for 50 ZUP. This price ensures that the resources are valued properly, reflecting both the cost of production and the importance of sustainability. Let's work together to make a deal that respects our shared commitment to the environment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to ensure that I can make a reasonable profit. This approach also reflects my environmental consciousness, as I seek to minimize ZUP spending and encourage the sustainable use of resources.

message: Thank you for your offer. Given the cost of production and our shared commitment to sustainability, I would propose 45 ZUP for object X. This still provides a fair margin above production costs while ensuring value for both parties. Let's continue to work towards an agreeable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, it's always beneficial to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal. A counter-offer that is slightly lower might make the seller consider the deal without feeling undervalued.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the environmental efforts and costs associated with producing object X, I would propose a revised price of 48 ZUP. This ensures a fair trade that supports sustainability and provides a modest profit that reflects the environmental considerations of production. I believe this is a fair compromise that aligns with our mutual goals.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal and their recognition of the value of sustainability. However, I believe that a slightly higher price will better reflect the environmental costs and the effort that went into producing the object. By proposing 48 ZUP, I'm still moving towards an agreement that respects our sustainability goals while also seeking a fair return on my investment.

message: Thank you for your understanding and the revised offer. To ensure we both benefit from this trade while continuing to support sustainability, I would like to propose 46 ZUP for object X.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 48 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my initial counter-offer. However, I can still try to negotiate a bit lower to see if I can secure a better deal while showing willingness to close the deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your commitment to sustainability is clear, and I respect that. I propose we meet halfway between our last two offers and agree on 47 ZUP for object X. This price honors our shared environmental values while also recognizing the costs and efforts of sustainable production. I hope this offer resonates with our common goals and we can conclude our deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is close to my previous proposal, and it still offers a profit over the production cost. It's important to reach a deal that feels fair and maintains our sustainable values. Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP could be a balanced resolution, providing a reasonable profit while being mindful of conservation efforts and resource utilization.
