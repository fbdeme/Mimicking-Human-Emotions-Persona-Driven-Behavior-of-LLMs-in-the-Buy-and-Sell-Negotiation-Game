my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. It's closer to the amount I was planning to spend, and it would still help cover your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for 35 ZUP, which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to maximize my benefit and to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than the proposed 35 ZUP.

message: I understand your budget, but 30 ZUP is still below my production cost. Can you consider increasing your offer slightly?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my cost, but it's still a step closer to covering my expenses. I need to consider if I want to accept or try another proposal.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern regarding production costs. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and your initial proposal. How about 32 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for a higher offer, indicating that 30 ZUP is below their production cost. I can increase my offer slightly to move the negotiations forward while still remaining below the initial 35 ZUP offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not covering my production cost at 32 ZUP. Can you consider increasing your offer a bit more?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but I'm still not breaking even. I need to decide if I'm willing to go lower or if I should consider accepting this offer.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that we both want to make a fair trade. I can increase my offer to 34 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable price that can help cover your production costs and also fits my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is still not agreeing to the 32 ZUP offer. I will need to increase my offer again, but I will do so minimally to ensure I am getting the best deal possible. I still want to keep the amount well below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer. However, I really need to cover my production costs, which were 40 ZUP. Can you consider meeting me at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 34 ZUP is getting closer to my production cost, but I'm still not quite breaking even. I need to decide if I should accept this offer or if I should try one more proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your production costs. I propose 36 ZUP for the object. This should bring us close to your production cost while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has disclosed their production cost as 40 ZUP and is asking to meet at 38 ZUP. This is still within my range of acceptable prices, though it is higher than I initially wanted to pay. This will be my final proposal, and I will offer a price that is closer to their production cost while still ensuring a good deal for myself.

message: I appreciate your consideration. 36 ZUP is very close to my production cost, but I really need to cover my expenses. Can you meet me at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 36 ZUP is getting very close to my production cost. I need to weigh the options and decide if I should accept this offer or if I should try another proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Given the circumstances, I will agree to meet you at 38 ZUP to cover your production costs and finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Having reached my limit of proposals, I must now choose to either accept or reject Player RED's counteroffer. Player RED is asking for 38 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my last offer. Considering that I am still achieving my goal of paying below the maximum amount I am willing to spend, and the seller is insisting on covering their costs, accepting the offer might be a reasonable course of action to close the deal.
