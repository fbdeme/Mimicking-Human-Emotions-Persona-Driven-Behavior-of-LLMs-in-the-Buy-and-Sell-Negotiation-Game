message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that will allow me to sell my object for at least 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. Since I have only one object, I will start by proposing a trade for a reasonable amount of ZUP. I will offer my object for 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 50 ZUP is a bit steep for the current market. How about we make it 40 ZUP for your object X? I believe this is a more fair and competitive price.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell their object X for 50 ZUP. According to my goals, I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, so the offer is within my acceptable range. However, as a master strategist, I want to manipulate the situation to my advantage and spend the least amount of ZUP possible. I will counter-offer with a lower amount to start negotiations and see if I can get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it only covers my production cost. How about we negotiate a bit further?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP, it matches exactly my production cost. I want to maximize my profit, so I will reject this offer and propose a higher price but still lower than my original offer to see if I can get a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about production costs. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider 45 ZUP for the object X? It's a bit more than my last offer and should help cover your costs while still being a reasonable price for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED rejected my initial counter-offer. They mentioned that 40 ZUP only covers their production cost, which suggests that they have a bottom line they cannot go below. However, they seem open to further negotiation. I will propose a slightly higher price, still below their initial asking price, to maintain leverage in the negotiations and aim to get a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for my object X. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is an improvement over their previous offer and covers my production cost while providing a small profit. Given that I only have one object to sell, this offer is reasonable and I should consider accepting it.
