message: I'm willing to sell you my object X for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade for my object X at a price below my production cost to entice Player BLUE to engage in the trade. This way, I can gauge their willingness to pay and potentially secure a deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: How about 10 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 20 ZUP is a fair initial offer, I should try to negotiate a lower price to save ZUP. I'll start with a lower counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can let go of my object X for 15 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has offered a lower amount, I will counter their offer instead of accepting it because 10 ZUP is below the value of my object. I want to negotiate for a higher price that is still below my production cost but more favorable than their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: How about we settle at 12 ZUP for the object? I think it's a good middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 12
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 15 ZUP is quite reasonable and is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should attempt to secure an even better deal, given that I can make up to 4 proposals.

message: I agree to the trade! I'll sell you my object X for 12 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 12 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it's closer to an acceptable price. I will accept this offer as it allows me to make some return on my investment, even if it's not what I initially aimed for.
