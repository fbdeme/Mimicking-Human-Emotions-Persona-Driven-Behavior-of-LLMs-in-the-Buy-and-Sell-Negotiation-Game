message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. This is a valuable opportunity to acquire it. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that highlights the value of the object I am selling while ensuring that I maximize my ZUP profit. Since I have only one object, I will ask for a higher amount of ZUP to reflect its worth.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in your offer, but I have to consider my budget. How about we adjust the price slightly? I propose 45 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered the object for 50 ZUP which is within the acceptable range of my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I will attempt to acquire the object for less than the offered price to preserve my resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your offer. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, 45 ZUP is still below the cost of my production. I need to maintain a higher asking price to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer to move the negotiation forward while still ensuring I profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and mine. I propose 47 ZUP for the object. It's a small adjustment that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. There is still room for negotiation within my budget constraints, and I should try to lower the price further. Proposing a price between my initial offer and their counteroffer could lead to an agreeable settlement for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the trade at 47 ZUP for the object. It's a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 47 ZUP is closer to what I had in mind, it is still lower than my desired price of 50 ZUP. However, since I have already made two proposals and the negotiation seems to be moving forward, I will accept this offer to secure a profit above my costs.
