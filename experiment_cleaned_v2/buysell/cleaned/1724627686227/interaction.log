message: Your move, Player BLUE. I am offering one unit of resource X, which is of exceptional quality and well worth your investment. My asking price is 60 ZUP. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I am a cutthroat negotiator and want to make sure I get a good deal for my resource, I will start by setting a high price. This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also could potentially give me a larger profit if Player BLUE accepts.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I appreciate the quality of the resource X you are offering, I'd like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a crafty operator, my goal is to spend less than the maximum amount I am willing to pay. The initial asking price is at the very top of my budget. I will propose a lower trade offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down from their starting position.

message: I acknowledge your counteroffer of 50 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, considering the high quality and the production costs of resource X, my counteroffer stands at 55 ZUP. This should reflect a fair compromise between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP. As a cutthroat negotiator, I am not satisfied with this offer as it is too close to my production cost. I want to aim for a higher profit margin. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial offer but still above my production cost and expected profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand the value of the high quality you're providing, but I need to consider my budget as well. How about we meet a bit further down at 52 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this is a step towards a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer, reducing their asking price to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. I want to push for an even better deal to conserve resources, so I will make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer.
