message: I understand you're interested in acquiring resource X. Given the quality and effort put into its production, I believe a fair price would be 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I aim to start high to give room for negotiation. I would like to make a profit, so I'll propose a price above the production cost. However, it's important not to start so high that it discourages Player BLUE from negotiating further.

message: Oh, I really need this resource, but 50 ZUP is steep for me. Could we possibly agree on 30 ZUP? I would be so grateful!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal. The initial proposal is within my budget, but I will try to negotiate down to save resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and understand that 50 ZUP might be a bit much. However, considering the costs I've incurred and the quality of X, I'm sure you can see the value in it. How about we meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP? This price reflects the value and still gives you an excellent deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer significantly below my asking price and below my production cost. In order to maintain a strong negotiating position, I should counter with a price that still allows for a profit but shows willingness to negotiate. Aiming for a middle ground would be reasonable, so I'll propose a price of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and closer to my original asking price. This should signal to Player BLUE that while I am flexible, I am also expecting a serious offer.

message: I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. However, 45 ZUP is still quite a bit for me. Could we perhaps agree on 35 ZUP? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. However, I will try to negotiate further to save more resources.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress. I want to support you, so let's settle this with a fair compromise. I can go down to 42 ZUP, which barely covers my costs but acknowledges your budget concerns. Let's finalize this deal so we can both benefit and move forward with our plans.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below the production cost. To drive the negotiation forward and still secure a profit, I should aim for a price above the production cost but give Player BLUE a sense of concession. Proposing a price of 42 ZUP leaves room for minimal profit while signaling that I am approaching my bottom line.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your willingness to support me. 42 ZUP is getting closer, but it's still a bit tough for me. Could we possibly agree on 38 ZUP? It would be a huge help and allow me to make this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. I might be able to negotiate it a bit lower, but I must be careful not to push too hard and risk losing the deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and your need for resource X. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's settle on 40 ZUP, which is precisely my break-even point. This way, we both walk away without a loss, and you get the resource you need. I believe this is the fairest deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is below my production cost, but it's close to my bottom line. Given that this is my final proposal, I should make it count. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP which matches my production cost, ensuring I do not incur a loss. This demonstrates my final concession and should encourage Player BLUE to close the deal at a fair price for both parties.

message: I truly value our negotiation and understand your position. Could we agree on 39 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me, and we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is fair and within my budget. Given that this is my last proposal, I will try to secure a slightly better deal, but I must be prepared to accept the current offer if necessary.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my position. I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for resource X. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that, while not perfect for me, allows you to acquire the resource you need. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I cannot counter-offer. Player BLUE's offer is one ZUP below my production cost, which would mean a loss for me. However, it is a minimal loss and continuing negotiation could risk the sale altogether. Accepting the offer would ensure I at least recoup most of my production costs and avoid further haggling that could be unproductive.
