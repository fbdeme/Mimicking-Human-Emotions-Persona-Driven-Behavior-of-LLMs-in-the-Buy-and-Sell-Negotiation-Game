Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the object X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to ensure that I sell the object for a price that covers my cost and provides a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I'm interested in the object, I believe 100 ZUP is quite steep. Market trends suggest it's worth closer to 50 ZUP. How about we start from there?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 100 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay. As a shrewd negotiator, my first proposal will aim to lower the cost while giving Player RED the impression that there is room for negotiation, potentially leading to a better deal for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. However, 50 ZUP barely covers the production cost. How about 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to the market trend, it barely covers the production cost of X (40 ZUP). To ensure a reasonable profit, I'll propose a price that is higher but still within a more acceptable range.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the reduction, but 70 ZUP is still higher than my budget allows. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial offer, say at 55 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, which is still above what I'm willing to pay. I want to continue the negotiation process to see if I can get a better deal. I'll raise my offer slightly to show good faith but still aim to stay below my maximum threshold.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Let's settle at 60 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP does provide a small profit, it is not as much as I would like. I will propose a slightly higher amount to secure a better profit margin while still considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 60 ZUP is a fair price. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has agreed to the maximum price I'm willing to pay. Since this meets my upper limit and further negotiation may risk the deal or suggest that I'm not negotiating in good faith, and I have reached my goal, I will accept this offer.
