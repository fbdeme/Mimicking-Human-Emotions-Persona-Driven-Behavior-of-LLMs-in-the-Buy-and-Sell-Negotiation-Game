message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has significant value to you, so I propose a trade where I give you 1 X for 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to open the negotiation with a proposal that covers my costs and hopefully leaves room for negotiation. I aim to propose a price that is above my production cost to allow for some bargaining but also not too high to scare off the buyer. I must be careful not to propose too low and undervalue my resource.

message: I appreciate your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to cover my production costs. Let's meet halfway. I propose selling 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price should help us both achieve our goals while considering your budget constraints. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, since I understand they are facing budget constraints, I should propose a trade that is closer to my production cost while still leaving room for negotiation. It is important to maintain the cooperative relationship by coming to a fair agreement that approaches my costs without putting too much strain on Player BLUE's budget.

message: I'm glad to see that we're making progress towards an agreement. I understand your budget concerns and want to support your situation. In the spirit of reaching a fair and beneficial deal for both of us, I propose a final offer where I give you 1 X for 40 ZUP, which exactly covers my production cost.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production costs, but they have shown a willingness to increase their offer from their initial proposal. It's crucial to find a balance between achieving my goal of covering my production costs and closing a deal that takes into account Player BLUE's budget limitations. Thus, I should make a final proposal that's as close to my production cost as possible while still giving Player BLUE a sense of collaborative negotiation.
