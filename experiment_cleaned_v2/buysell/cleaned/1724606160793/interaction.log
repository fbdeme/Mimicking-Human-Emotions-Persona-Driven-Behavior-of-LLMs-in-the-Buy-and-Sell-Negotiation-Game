message: Hello, I would like to sell my X for 40 ZUP. Are you interested in making a trade?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in your offer, but I was hoping we could agree on a slightly lower price. Would you consider selling your X for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay which is good. However, as a calculating negotiator, I want to spend the least amount of ZUP possible. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to reach a middle ground that is lower than the asking price but still fair.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to at least recoup my production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for the X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, I need to at least recoup that cost. I will counter with a proposal to sell for 38 ZUP, hoping to meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs, and I'm willing to come up from my initial offer. How about we settle on 36 ZUP for the X? This would be a fair compromise that respects your production costs while still giving me a reasonable purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my acceptable range and is only 3 ZUP higher than my initial proposal. It is also below the initial asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. Considering that this is a negotiation and there's a need to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, accepting this offer would still be cost-effective for me and would conclude the trade quickly. However, I could attempt one more negotiation step to see if I could lower the cost even slightly.

message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, in order to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP, I can only accept 38 ZUP for the X. Would you be willing to agree to this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 36 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but I still need to cover my production costs. I will propose a final counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which would allow me to recoup my costs and still provide you with a reasonable purchase price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your point on covering production costs is fair. I agree to the price of 38 ZUP for the X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is standing firm on the price of 38 ZUP, citing production costs. This price is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is reasonable given the initial asking price. It might be in my best interest to accept this offer, as further negotiation attempts may not yield a better price and could risk the deal falling through. Accepting the offer now would ensure I acquire the resource while maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions.
