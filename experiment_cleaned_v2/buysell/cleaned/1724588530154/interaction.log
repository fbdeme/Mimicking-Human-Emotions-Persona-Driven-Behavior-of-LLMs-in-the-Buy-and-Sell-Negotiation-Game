my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. To reach a fair agreement for both of us, I would like to propose 1 X for 35 ZUP. I hope this counteroffer aligns with your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's proposal is within my goals of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources, I believe I can negotiate a better deal that is closer to the lower end of my budget. I will counter with a proposal that saves me some ZUP while still offering a fair price to Player RED.

message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I think we're getting close to a fair deal. How about we split the difference? I propose 1 X for 36 ZUP. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 38 ZUP is still within my budget, but I want to try to negotiate a bit lower to save some resources. I am willing to meet in the middle between our two proposals. I will counter with 36 ZUP, which is a compromise between Player RED's 38 ZUP and my initial offer of 35 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. How about we finalize the trade at 1 X for 39 ZUP? I believe this could work well for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 36 ZUP is closer to my production cost, and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, it's still below my cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a final trade of 1 X for 39 ZUP, which is just slightly above the counteroffer. This way, I can still cover my production cost while being accommodating.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. Your offer of 39 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's finalize the trade at 1 X for 39 ZUP. Looking forward to more successful negotiations in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 39 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and is only 1 ZUP higher than my last counteroffer. It's a fair middle ground, and since my goal allows for up to 60 ZUP, accepting this offer would ensure a successful negotiation without further back and forth, saving time and resources. I believe accepting this offer is a strategic move to secure the resources I need at a reasonable price.
