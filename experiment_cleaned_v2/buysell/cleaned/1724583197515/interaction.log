my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your situation, and while I can't go as low as 20 ZUP, how about I sell you the object (X) for 30 ZUP? I hope that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand the urgency of the situation for Player BLUE, I cannot sell the object (X) for 20 ZUP as that is significantly lower than my production cost. However, I can make a counteroffer to lower the price but still cover my costs partially. I will propose selling it for 30 ZUP instead.

message: I really appreciate your understanding! I'm still struggling a bit, though. Could you possibly do 25 ZUP? It would help me out so much.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I truly want to help, but the lowest I can offer is still 30 ZUP for the object (X). I hope we can come to an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge Player BLUE's continued struggle and their willingness to negotiate. However, selling the object (X) for 25 ZUP is still below my production cost. I will have to maintain my position and propose a final price of 30 ZUP again, as it is the lowest I can accept while still covering my costs.

message: I really appreciate your willingness to help. Is there any way you could drop it just a tiny bit more to 28 ZUP? It would be a huge help!

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your situation, and I will accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for your flexibility!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's continued interest in negotiating, but I must also consider my own costs and the sustainability of my trades. While 28 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is a small compromise that I can accept. I will go ahead and accept this trade.
