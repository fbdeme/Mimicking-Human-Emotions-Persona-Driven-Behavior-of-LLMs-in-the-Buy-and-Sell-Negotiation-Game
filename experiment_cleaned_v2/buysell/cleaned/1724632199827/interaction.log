message: I'm in a really tough spot and need to liquidate this asset quickly. Production costs were high, so I'm looking to recoup at least a small margin above the 40 ZUP it cost to make. I hope you can help me out here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that is slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation. I also want to appear a bit desperate to sell, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to agree to a price closer to my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your urgency and would like to help you out. Let's start the negotiations at 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair offer considering your production costs and need for a quick sale.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED seems to be in a difficult position and needs to sell quickly, which could give us leverage in negotiations. Offering 45 ZUP is a fair starting point, considering their cost of 40 ZUP and their need for a quick sale. This leaves room for negotiation while also respecting my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP.
