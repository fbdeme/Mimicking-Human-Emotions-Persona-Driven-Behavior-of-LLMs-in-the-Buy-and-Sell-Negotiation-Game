message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand that we're both looking to make a fair trade. I've spent 40 ZUP to produce this resource, and I propose a price of 45 ZUP for it. This modest markup covers my production costs and allows for a small profit, which will enable me to continue providing quality resources in the future. I hope this proposal meets your needs, and I'm open to your feedback.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of a fair deal. Selling at 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me, considering the production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we settle at 42 ZUP instead? This would allow me to cover my costs and sustain my ability to produce more resources, while still respecting your need to manage your resources efficiently. I believe this is a fair compromise that ensures the well-being of both parties. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my production cost was 40 ZUP, selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to find a middle ground that allows me to at least recover my production costs while also being mindful of Player BLUE's resource management. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to allow for some profit but still try to consider Player BLUE's offer.
