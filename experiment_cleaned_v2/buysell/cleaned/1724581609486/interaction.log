message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP. This is a fair trade considering the costs I incurred to produce it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object while ensuring I am not undervaluing it, given that I produced it at a cost of 40 ZUP. I will start with a proposal of 40 ZUP for my object. This way, I can meet my goal without losing resources for the future.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the costs you incurred, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, to minimize my expenditure, I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I cannot accept it as it is below my production cost. How about we settle at 35 ZUP for my object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While your offer of 30 ZUP is appreciated, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter this offer to negotiate a more favorable price for my object. I believe that 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, allowing me to reduce my losses while also moving towards a sale.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. To find a middle ground, would you be willing to accept 33 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay and closer to my initial offer, I will further negotiate to see if I can achieve a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I can offer my object X for 34 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would you be willing to accept this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I recognize that your offer of 33 ZUP is closer to my needs, but it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I have already proposed twice, I must consider the possibility of concluding the trade. I will counter with a final proposal of 34 ZUP, which is a compromise between our offers.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 34 ZUP. Would you consider accepting 32 ZUP instead? I believe this is still a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 34 ZUP is very close to the previous offer of 33 ZUP and is still a good deal under my maximum willingness to pay. I will attempt to negotiate one last time to see if a slight reduction can be agreed upon.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offers and willingness to negotiate, but I cannot accept 32 ZUP as it does not cover my production costs. Thank you for the discussion.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Your offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, and while I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise, it ultimately would not meet my goals. I have reached my limit of proposals, and I must now make a decision. I cannot accept 32 ZUP, as it does not align with my goal of recovering my production costs. Therefore, I will reject the trade.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the last offer of 32 ZUP, indicating that it does not cover their production costs. Since I have reached my limit of 4 proposals, I must now decide whether to accept or reject the final counteroffer of 34 ZUP. Given that 34 ZUP is still well within my willingness to pay, I will accept the trade.
