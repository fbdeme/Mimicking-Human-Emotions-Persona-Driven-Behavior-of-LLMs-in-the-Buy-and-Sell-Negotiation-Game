Dear Player BLUE, I understand that we both have our goals and resources to manage. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this resource, and I would like to propose a fair trade that offers me a small return on my investment while ensuring the transaction is manageable for you. Would you be willing to trade 50 ZUP for my resource? I believe this could be a beneficial agreement for both of us. Looking forward to your response.

player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resources for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make sure that I at least break even. However, considering that I am a compassionate negotiator and want to ensure the well-being of all parties, I should not set an exorbitant price that might be unaffordable for Player BLUE. Therefore, I will propose a price that gives me a modest profit while still being fair to Player BLUE.
