message: I'm offering this valuable resource for 80 ZUP. It has unique properties that make it well worth the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I want to start negotiations by setting a high initial price to give myself room to maneuver and potentially settle at a higher price than my minimum requirement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the unique properties of the resource you're offering, but my current budget allows me to offer 50 ZUP for it. Perhaps there's a possibility for us to find a middle ground that respects the value of your resource while staying within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED exceeds my maximum willingness to pay by 20 ZUP. I want to propose a counteroffer that aligns with my goals, yet still opens the door for negotiation. By offering a lower amount, I can gauge Player RED's flexibility and perhaps arrive at a mutually acceptable price through the negotiation process.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but considering the quality and potential benefits of the resource, I believe 65 ZUP would be a fairer price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my minimum acceptable price of 40 ZUP. However, I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than their offer to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you see in the resource, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. My final offer for the resource can be 60 ZUP. I hope this price reflects our mutual intent to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 65 ZUP is closer to my maximum limit of 60 ZUP, indicating their willingness to negotiate. However, it still exceeds the amount I'm willing to pay. I will make a second proposal at my maximum limit to signal my final price without exceeding my budget. This maintains my negotiating strategy and respects my initial goals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. How about we close the deal at 63 ZUP? It's just a bit more and reflects the true value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 60 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. However, I will attempt to push the price slightly higher while still showing flexibility.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we are moving towards an agreement. I really do see the worth in what you're offering, but I must stick to my budget of 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us, considering the constraints I'm working with. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has come down to 63 ZUP, which is slightly above my stated maximum, I must stand firm on my budget limitations. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, I need to consider the possibility of a small concession that could lead to a successful deal without significantly compromising my goals. I'll offer an alternative that is within my limits but also shows willingness to value the resource.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Let's finalize the deal at 60 ZUP. I believe this is mutually beneficial.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP and is not willing to go higher. Given that this offer is still above my production cost and close to my recent counter-offer, it is a reasonable deal to accept.
