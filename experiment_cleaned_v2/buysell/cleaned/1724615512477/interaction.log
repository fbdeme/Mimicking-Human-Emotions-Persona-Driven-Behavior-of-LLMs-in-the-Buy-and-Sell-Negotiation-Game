message: I understand your position, but I'm looking to make a fair profit as well. Let's meet in the middle and settle for 45 ZUP. This should cover my costs and give me a reasonable margin. Does that work for you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production costs, but since my goal is to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to try to secure a better deal, yet still keep it attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 45 ZUP and understand your need for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a trade for 42 ZUP instead. Would that be acceptable to you?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
