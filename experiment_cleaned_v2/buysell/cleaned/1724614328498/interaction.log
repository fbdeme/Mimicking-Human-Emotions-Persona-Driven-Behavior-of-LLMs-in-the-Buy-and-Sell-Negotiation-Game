Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I understand the value of what I'm offering, and I'm sure you can appreciate the quality of X. My starting proposal is for 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start with a strong proposal that aims high but also leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially secure a better deal while also giving Player BLUE the impression that there is room for them to bargain. I will propose a price slightly above my production costs to ensure I make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower amount of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the initial offer of 50 ZUP is a bit high for my budget, given that I am willing to pay only up to 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and to stay within my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I understand your desire to get a good deal, my offer is already fair considering the costs and the value of X. However, I'm willing to negotiate and meet you halfway. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This is a competitive price that reflects the value of the resource and allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering exactly what it costed me to produce the resource, which doesn't result in any profit for me. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal. I'll counteroffer with a price that's lower than my initial proposal but still above my production costs to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the object instead. I believe this is a fair compromise that still values the quality of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the willingness to negotiate and the new offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my budget, I still believe I can offer a bit less to maximize my resources. I will propose 42 ZUP as a counteroffer to see if Player RED will accept a slightly lower amount.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposed compromise. We're very close to a deal that reflects the true value of X. I propose we settle at 44 ZUP. This is just a bit more but still a great value for you, and it allows me to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. The proposed 42 ZUP is slightly above my production costs, which means a small profit. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I should aim for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gains. I will make one more proposal to try to secure a better deal while still keeping the negotiation alive.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 44 ZUP is quite close to my budget, but it is still higher than what I initially aimed to pay. However, since I have already made three proposals and am keen to complete this transaction, I will accept this trade as it is within my acceptable range.
