Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your starting offer, but to make this worthwhile for both of us, I have adjusted my price to 55 ZUP. This accounts for the value and quality of the object while still being a reasonable step down from my starting price. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production, which doesn't account for any profit. As a cutthroat negotiator, I need to counter with a price above production cost to ensure profit. I will decrease my initial proposal slightly but remain above production cost to maintain a strong negotiating position.
