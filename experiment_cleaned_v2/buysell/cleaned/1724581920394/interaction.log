message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. This way, you have the opportunity to acquire it while I also gain a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that allows me to maximize my ZUP gain while also ensuring that Player BLUE is incentivized to accept. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose to sell it for a price that provides a profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for X. Let's make this deal happen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for a better deal to save as much ZUP as possible.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I cannot sell for 30 ZUP. How about I offer you the object for 45 ZUP? This is a more balanced price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which is not acceptable for me. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal while still being reasonable enough to encourage Player BLUE to consider it. I will propose a price of 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. How about we meet closer to the middle at 35 ZUP? This will still benefit both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but I will continue to push for a better deal to maximize my savings.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I cannot sell for 35 ZUP. I can offer you the object for 40 ZUP, which would at least allow me to cover my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which does not align with my goals. However, it is closer to a reasonable price. I will counter with a trade of 40 ZUP, which will allow me to break even on my costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we finalize the deal at 38 ZUP? This is very close to your offer and should be acceptable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is quite reasonable and very close to what I initially aimed for. However, I will make one final attempt to lower the price further, ensuring I get the best possible deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is a reasonable compromise given our discussions. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I will accept this offer to secure a deal rather than risk ending the negotiation without a sale.
