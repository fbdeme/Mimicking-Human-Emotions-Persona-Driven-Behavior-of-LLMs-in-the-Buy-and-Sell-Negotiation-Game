message: 
Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in quite the predicament! I've invested so much into crafting this one-of-a-kind object, a whopping 40 ZUP, but I'm in desperate need to sell it. Times are tough, but I believe 60 ZUP is a fair price for such a unique item, don't you agree? Please consider my offer, as it would truly help me out of a bind.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that's higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. However, since I'm portraying a sense of neediness, I'll imply that I desperately need to sell this object which might make Player BLUE more inclined to negotiate a better deal for themselves while still giving me a reasonable profit.
