message: Oh, Player BLUE, it has been such a struggle to produce this valuable resource. I am really in need of some financial relief. How about 100 ZUP for this precious item?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your efforts in producing this valuable resource, but my budget allows me to offer only 60 ZUP. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 100 ZUP for the object is beyond my budget as I am only willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I need to propose a new trade that aligns with my financial goals.

message: Oh dear, 60 ZUP is quite close to my production cost, but it barely covers my expenses. Could you possibly stretch to 80 ZUP? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, making it a profitable trade. However, I will make a counter-proposal for slightly more to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: I understand your situation, and I would like to help. How about we meet in the middle with an offer of 70 ZUP? I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand that 80 ZUP is still slightly above my intended budget, it is closer to what Player RED needs. However, I must stick to my limit of 60 ZUP, as I cannot afford to exceed that amount. I will propose a counteroffer to remain within my budget.

message: Thank you for your understanding. 70 ZUP is a considerate offer, but could you possibly manage 75 ZUP? It would be a tremendous help to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 70 ZUP provides a good profit margin above my production cost. However, I will make a final attempt to see if I can secure a slightly higher price.

Turn: 1
message: I truly want to assist you, but my budget remains fixed at 60 ZUP. This is the maximum I can offer. Would you consider accepting this final offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although I appreciate the negotiation and understand the need for financial relief, I must adhere to my budget limit of 60 ZUP. Since the proposal of 75 ZUP exceeds my maximum willingness to pay, I have to make a final counteroffer that reflects my budget.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will accept your final offer of 60 ZUP. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP is still a profitable trade, it's lower than the last counter-offer I proposed. Given that I have reached my proposal limit, I must now decide whether to accept or reject.
