message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This proposal covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and provides a fair profit. This will ensure that I am not at a loss and can continue to produce resources sustainably. Given that the cost to produce X was 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that aims for 60 ZUP to ensure a reasonable profit margin.
