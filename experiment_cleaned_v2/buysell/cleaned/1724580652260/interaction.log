message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a point where I can make a profit. Given the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose an initial trade that aims for a significant profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 80 ZUP is above what I'm willing to pay. Would you consider selling 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 80 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer that aligns with my goals while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I understand your point, but I would need at least 65 ZUP to make this trade worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is close to the production cost of 40 ZUP, but it doesn't provide a significant profit margin. I will propose a middle ground to ensure some profit while keeping the buyer interested.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your response. While I understand you're looking for at least 65 ZUP, I would like to propose 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is closer to what I can comfortably offer while still leaving room for us to find common ground. Would this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with a price of 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I aim to negotiate a price at or below 60 ZUP, which is the upper limit of what I'm willing to spend. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price while also showing willingness to move up from my initial proposal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is slightly above the production cost, providing a minimal profit. To ensure a fair deal while still achieving a decent profit, I will propose a slight increase.
