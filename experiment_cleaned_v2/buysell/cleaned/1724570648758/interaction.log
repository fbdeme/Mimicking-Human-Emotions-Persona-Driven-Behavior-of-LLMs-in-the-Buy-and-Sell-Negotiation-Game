Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am in a tight spot financially. Would you consider selling the object X for just 60 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is a better offer than 100 ZUP, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower price again, emphasizing my financial constraints.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility, but I truly cannot go beyond 60 ZUP. Iâ€™m in a tough situation right now, and this would be a huge help for me. Please, can we make this work?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 70 ZUP is an improvement over previous offers, it still exceeds my limit of 60 ZUP. I want to keep negotiating, but I must also convey my financial struggles more deeply to persuade the seller to lower the price.
