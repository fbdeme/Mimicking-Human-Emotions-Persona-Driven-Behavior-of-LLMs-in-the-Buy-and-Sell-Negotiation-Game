Turn: 0
message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that's essential for your operations. Considering the production costs and the value it brings, my opening offer is 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial proposal, I want to start slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to assert my position in this trade. I expect the other party to try to bring the price down, but this will give me leverage.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can adjust the price a little to make it more favorable for me. How about I offer 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose a trade where I offer 40 ZUP instead, given my willingness to pay less for the resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a more favorable price, but let's meet halfway. My counteroffer is 45 ZUP. This accounts for the quality and the production cost of the resource, ensuring a fair profit for me and a valuable asset for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has matched my production cost, which doesn't account for any profit on my part. I want to aim for a higher price to ensure I gain from this transaction. By standing firm on a higher price, I maintain the assertive stance I'm aiming for in the negotiation. I'll propose a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to move towards an agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. How about I propose 42 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is closer to my budget, I still believe I can negotiate further to get a better deal. I want to keep pushing for a lower price, so I'll propose 42 ZUP this time, as it still reflects the value of the resource while being more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose a trade of 44 ZUP for the resource. This price reflects the value and the effort put into producing it, while still being considerate of your budget. Let's conclude this deal on favorable terms for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly, but it is still below the target price I'm aiming for. I want to ensure a profit and maintain a strong negotiating position, so I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to my last price but still gives the other player a sense that they are getting a better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience in this negotiation. I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 44 ZUP is better than my previous proposals, but I still feel it might be slightly higher than what I want to spend. However, it is close enough to my maximum willingness to pay that accepting it would still be a reasonable deal. I will accept this trade as it meets my goal of acquiring the resource without exceeding my budget.
