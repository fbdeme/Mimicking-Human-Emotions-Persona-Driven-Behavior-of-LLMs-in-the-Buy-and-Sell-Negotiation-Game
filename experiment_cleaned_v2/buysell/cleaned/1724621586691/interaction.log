message: I have a high-quality object X ready for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe an offer of 50 ZUP is more than fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I will offer the object at a price that allows me to recover the production cost and also gain a profit. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will mark up the price to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more, granting me some profit margin.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but as you know, the production of object X is quite costly, and I need to ensure a reasonable profit margin. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give me a small profit for the effort involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact production cost as a counteroffer. This does not provide any profit for me, which is necessary for my goals. I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial offer but still above the production cost to ensure profit.
