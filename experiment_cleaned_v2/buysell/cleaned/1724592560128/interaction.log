message: Oh dear, I'm in a bit of a tight spot right now and every ZUP counts for me. I would really appreciate it if you could consider lowering the price a bit. Would you be willing to part with X for just 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever grateful for your kindness!

message: Your generosity is truly touching, and I'm so grateful for your understanding.

reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's situation and their gratitude. However, I still need to cover my costs, and while 35 ZUP was the minimum I could consider, I will have to find a middle ground that allows me to sell while still being a bit understanding. I will propose 34 ZUP this time.

message: Your kindness is like a light in these tough times, and I am so close to reaching a deal that I can afford. If we could settle on 33 ZUP, I could still keep a tiny buffer for the unforeseen expenses that always seem to pop up. Please consider this as my final stretched offer!
