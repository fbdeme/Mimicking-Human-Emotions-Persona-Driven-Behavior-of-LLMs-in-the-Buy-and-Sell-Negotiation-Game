message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I'm in a real tough spot here. I've put everything into producing this precious object, and I'm really counting on making at least a tiny profit to keep things afloat. It cost me 40 ZUP to make, and it would mean the world to me if you could offer 50 ZUP. I'm sure it's worth it, and your generosity would not go unnoticed!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I am Player RED and I want to sell my resource, I will start with a proposal that is above my production cost, taking into account that I might need to negotiate down due to my strategy of exaggerating neediness. I want to make a profit, so I will begin by proposing a price that gives me some room to maneuver.

message: I appreciate your situation, but I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object. I hope this can work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand Player RED's situation, but I need to negotiate to lower the cost. The proposed 50 ZUP is still above my acceptable limit of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which is fair considering their cost.

message: I'm really touched by your offer, Player BLUE, truly, but I'm barely scraping by as it is. If I sell at cost, I might not be able to keep my operations running. Could you find it within your heart to meet me halfway at 45 ZUP? It would help me out tremendously, and you'd still be getting a fantastic deal for this high-quality item. Please consider it, for the sake of my humble endeavor.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount, still within a reasonable range, to try and gain some profit while maintaining the appearance of desperate need.

Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your position, and I truly want to help. Would you consider 42 ZUP for the object? I think this could be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I sympathize with Player RED's plight, I still aim to minimize my expenditure. The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my limit, but I can still negotiate further. I will propose 42 ZUP, which is a middle ground that respects their costs while also being less than their current counter-offer.

message: Bless your soul, Player BLUE, for being so considerate! It's heartwarming to see someone willing to support a small venture like mine. I'm stretching myself thin here, but because I can see you are trying to be fair, I'll lower my expectations a bit. Would you be able to do 44 ZUP? It's just a smidgen more, and it would make such a difference to me. What do you say, friend?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my asking price but still below my desired profit. I will attempt one more counterproposal to get closer to the 45 ZUP I previously asked for, but I will make a smaller increment to show my willingness to compromise and finalize the trade.

message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility! I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to completing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has been very accommodating, and their offer of 44 ZUP is closer to my limit and more reasonable than the original 50 ZUP. Considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I can accept this trade as it still meets my goals while helping them out.
