my resources: X: 1

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource. This would provide you with a profit above your costs, and it would be more in line with my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for the resource is close to the maximum I am willing to pay. However, since my goal is to collaborate and achieve a trade that's more beneficial for both parties, and considering the cost of production was 40 ZUP for Player RED, I will propose a lower amount that still allows for a profit margin for Player RED. This could leave room for further negotiation, aiming to spend less ZUP while still making the trade attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're on the same page regarding a fair deal. To meet halfway between our two proposals, I suggest 47 ZUP for the resource. This price respects both our positions and should be agreeable for both sides. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer which is close to my initial asking price and still allows for a profit. To facilitate a successful trade and maintain goodwill, I'm inclined to meet in the middle. By proposing a slightly higher price, I hope to reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both of us.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for considering a price that respects our positions. I propose we settle on 46 ZUP for the resource, which is a compromise between your initial offer and my first counter-offer. I believe this price is fair for both of us, giving you profit while also respecting my budget. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared goal of finding a fair and agreeable solution. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is within the limit that I'm willing to pay but still above my initial counter-offer. Since I want to collaborate and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counter-offer, but still less than Player RED's current offer. This should show my willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle while maintaining a good deal for myself.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. The offer of 46 ZUP for the resource is acceptable to me. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a reasonable counter-offer that is just 1 ZUP less than my last proposal. It's close to the middle ground between our initial offers, and accepting this deal would still allow me to make a profit that is above my production costs. To keep the negotiation positive and conclude the trade, I am willing to accept this offer.
