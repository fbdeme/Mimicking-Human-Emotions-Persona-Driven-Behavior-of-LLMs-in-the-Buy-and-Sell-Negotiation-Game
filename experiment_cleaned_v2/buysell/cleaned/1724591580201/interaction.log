message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm really in need of ZUP right now, and I hope you can help me out. I'm willing to sell my object X for just 30 ZUP. It would mean a lot to me, and I hope we can make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm feeling a bit desperate as I really need ZUP to sustain my operations. I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both, but I'm hoping to sell my object X for less than its production cost to make it more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Hey Player RED, I understand you're in need of ZUP, and I'm here to help. Your initial offer is quite generous, but I want to support you a bit more while staying within my budget. How about I give you 35 ZUP for the object X instead of 30 ZUP? This way, we can ensure that both of us are getting a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade that is well below the maximum I am willing to pay. Accepting their initial proposal would be beneficial for them as they are in need and also for me as it saves resources. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I will propose a slightly higher amount to support them better, within the bounds of my goals.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE! I truly appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but Iâ€™m feeling a bit pressed for resources. Would you consider 32 ZUP instead? It would really help me out a lot! I hope we can find a way that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm grateful for Player BLUE's willingness to help, and while 35 ZUP is closer to what I hoped for, I still feel a bit anxious about getting enough ZUP to sustain myself. I want to propose a counteroffer that is still reasonable but leans a bit more towards my needs.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I can see that you are in need, and I'm happy to accept your proposal of 32 ZUP for object X. I hope this helps you with your current situation and that we both benefit from this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for a slightly lower amount than my previous proposal. Since the counteroffer of 32 ZUP is still well within my budget and it will assist Player RED during their time of need, accepting this compromise supports my goal of being a compassionate negotiator.
