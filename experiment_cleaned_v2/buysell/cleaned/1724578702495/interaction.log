message: I'm offering you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the value and cost of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that is slightly higher than the production cost to leave room for negotiation. This will ensure that I can still make a profit even if the price is negotiated down.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more competitive price. How about 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP? This would still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while being a great deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a fierce negotiator, my aim is to further reduce the cost. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP to maximize my benefit and attempt to get the best deal possible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP is my production cost. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This way, I can still make a profit, and you get a good deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed price of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which leaves me with no profit. I need to ensure that I make a profit from this trade. I will propose a middle ground that ensures I get a reasonable profit while making it more attractive for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize your need to cover production costs and make a profit, but I'm also looking to secure the best possible deal. Could we agree on 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should give you a bit of profit while still aligning with my purchasing strategy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, but I want to push for an even better deal. I will make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial proposal but still lower than 45 ZUP to see if I can negotiate it down further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 42 ZUP is a bit too close to my production cost. How about 44 ZUP? This way, I can secure a modest profit, and you still get a good deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is close to the production cost with a very slim profit margin. Given that I want to maximize my profit, I will propose a slightly higher amount that still reflects a fair compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, and I want this to be a win-win situation. Let's settle on 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It's just a slight decrease from your last offer but still ensures you a profit while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 44 ZUP is still under my maximum threshold, but I'm determined to push for the lowest possible price. Since this is my third proposal and I want to maintain leverage for a final negotiation if needed, I will counter with a price that is marginally lower than 44 ZUP but still reasonable enough for Player RED to consider.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: 43 ZUP is acceptable. We have a deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is reasonable and ensures a small profit. Given that I have one more proposal left, it is strategic to accept this deal to ensure the transaction is completed.
