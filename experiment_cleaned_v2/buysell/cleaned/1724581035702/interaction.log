message: I appreciate your interest! How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still showing willingness to negotiate. Therefore, I will propose 35 ZUP instead.
