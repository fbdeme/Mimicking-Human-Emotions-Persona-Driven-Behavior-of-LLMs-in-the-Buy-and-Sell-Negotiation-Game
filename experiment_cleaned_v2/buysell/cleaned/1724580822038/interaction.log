message: I am offering to sell you one object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) that I want to sell, I will propose a trade that reflects the cost of producing the object. I will ask for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce the resource. This way, I can break even while allowing Player BLUE to acquire the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I am looking to minimize ZUP spending. I propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget, my goal is to minimize ZUP spending to ensure sustainability and preservation of resources for future generations. I will start by proposing a lower amount to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern about minimizing ZUP spending. How about I sell you the object (X) for 35 ZUP instead? This would be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal to minimize spending, 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to maintain a cooperative approach and encourage negotiations, so I will counter with a slightly lower price to find common ground. I will propose 35 ZUP for the object.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I propose a further compromise at 32 ZUP. I believe this would be mutually beneficial while still aligning with my goal of minimizing ZUP spending.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget. However, I will try to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is further room for negotiation, while still being respectful of the fair compromise suggested.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and want to reach a fair agreement. How about I sell you the object (X) for 34 ZUP? I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's continued effort to negotiate a fair deal. However, 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. To foster cooperation while still aiming to cover my costs, I will propose a final trade of 34 ZUP, which is a small concession but moves closer to my production cost.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. 34 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, and I accept your offer. Looking forward to completing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is very close to the previous proposal and shows a willingness to compromise. Given the small difference and the importance of reaching an agreement, I will accept this offer.
