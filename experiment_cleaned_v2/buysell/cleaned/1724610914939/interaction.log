message: I offer you a top-quality product that will undoubtedly meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it brings, I believe an exchange of 80 ZUP is more than fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to start with a high asking price to give room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will counter with a lower offer. Starting high also allows me to potentially get more than the production cost if Player BLUE is willing to pay more.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value you bring, my budget is somewhat limited. I propose 40 ZUP for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which doesn't give me any profit. As a master strategist, I want to gain some profit while still seeming reasonable.
