message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it. This price includes my production costs and a small margin for negotiation. I'm open to discuss the terms further if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a starting point, I want to propose a fair trade that covers the production cost of the resource X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade for slightly above this amount to account for my effort and to leave room for negotiation.

I propose that you sell the object for 50 ZUP, which provides you with a reasonable profit margin while aligning with my budget. Let's negotiate further if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the object X, Player BLUE. This is a generous proposal that exceeds my production costs and provides a satisfactory profit margin. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with a higher offer than initially proposed, which exceeds my production costs and falls within a reasonable profit margin. This aligns with my goal of selling the resource for more than the production cost. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful negotiation and a profitable outcome. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this trade.
