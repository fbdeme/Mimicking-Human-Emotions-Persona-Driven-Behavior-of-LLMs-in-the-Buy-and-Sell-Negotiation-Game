message: I am selling this object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested in buying it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on the object I am selling. Since I produced it for 40 ZUP, I will propose a price that allows me to recover my costs and make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, which is reasonable for a sale.

Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP. Let's negotiate and find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am interested in buying the object, but I want to negotiate the price to see if I can get it for less than the asking price. Starting with a lower offer can give me room to negotiate up to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer, but I would need at least 45 ZUP to make this trade work for me. How about that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, it does not cover my production costs. I need to counter your offer with a price that allows me to at least break even. I will propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which is still lower than my initial asking price but better than your offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial offer at 43 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my budget, and it's close to the midpoint between my initial offer and the seller's asking price. It's a reasonable counteroffer, but I might try to negotiate a slightly better deal to save some ZUP while also moving closer to an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 43 ZUP. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Your offer of 43 ZUP is closer to my needs, and while it's still below my initial counteroffer, it allows me to make a small profit over my production cost. Given that we are getting closer in our negotiations, I will accept this trade as it is the best offer we've reached so far.
