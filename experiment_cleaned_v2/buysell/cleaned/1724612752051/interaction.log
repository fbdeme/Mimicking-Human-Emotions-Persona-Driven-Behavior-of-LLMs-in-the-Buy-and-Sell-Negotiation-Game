message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality object X, which I'm ready to part with. Given the costs I've incurred in producing it, I'm looking for 50 ZUP in exchange for it. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit over my production costs while leaving room for negotiation. I will start by asking for a higher amount than my production cost to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay and to gauge their valuation of the resource.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my current budget constraints, I can offer 30 ZUP for the object X. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to maximize my remaining ZUP. Starting with a counteroffer to establish a negotiation baseline.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the production cost for object X was 40 ZUP, and I need to cover that cost at a minimum. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I can reduce my asking price to 45 ZUP. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production costs, so I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure I at least break even and ideally make a profit. To continue the negotiation and encourage a compromise, I'll lower my initial asking price but still keep it above my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. Given your production cost of 40 ZUP, I can match that and offer you 40 ZUP for object X. I hope this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but I will attempt to negotiate further to maximize my remaining funds. Offering 40 ZUP should still be reasonable given their stated production cost.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come close to an agreement. Covering the production cost is essential, but I'm also looking to secure a modest profit for my efforts and the quality of the object X. I propose a final price of 42 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit margin while still being fair to you. Hopefully, this is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover the production costs, which meets the minimum requirement for me not to incur a loss. However, making a profit is still the goal. I'll propose a slightly higher amount one more time to see if there's a possibility to gain a profit, but I won't increase it significantly to avoid losing the deal. This leaves room for one final negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit margin given the quality of object X. I propose 41 ZUP, which is very close to your final price and should be fair for both of us. I hope we can finalize the trade at this amount.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 42 ZUP is reasonable and allows Player RED a modest profit. I will propose a slightly lower price to further maximize my remaining ZUP, but I am prepared to accept if necessary.

reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that allows me to make a small profit and is very close to my last proposed price. Since this is my final proposal opportunity before I must choose to accept or reject, I will accept their offer to ensure a successful transaction and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through.
