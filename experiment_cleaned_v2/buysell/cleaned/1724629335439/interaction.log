message: I understand the importance of fair trade and I propose a price that covers the production cost and provides a modest profit margin. This should also take into account the value you place on resource X.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering that the production cost for the resource X is 40 ZUP, I want to make a profit, but as a compassionate negotiator, I'd like to propose a fair price that is not excessively higher than the cost to ensure that Player BLUE does not overpay.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE did not provide a counteroffer or response to the initial proposal, thus I will consider that the offer might be high for them. To maintain a compassionate stance and to facilitate a fair trade, I am willing to lower the price slightly to make it more accessible while still covering the production costs and allowing for a modest profit.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm making a second proposal that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but closer to the midpoint between the initial offer and my limit. This shows a good faith effort to reach a compromise while still aiming to spend less ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I have adjusted the price once more in hopes of finding a common ground that respects both our positions. I am offering resource X for a price that just slightly exceeds the production cost. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has still not responded with a counteroffer, it's possible that they are still considering the terms or they might be looking for a better price. To continue to negotiate compassionately, I will make a final modest price adjustment, hoping to close the deal while remaining fair and supportive of their financial situation.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am inching closer to a price that I hope will be acceptable to Player RED while still maintaining a conservative approach. By only slightly adjusting the price, I am signaling that I am nearing my limit without revealing my actual willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: In the spirit of fairness and understanding that we have not yet reached an agreement, I am offering resource X at the production cost. This is my final proposal and I hope it aligns with your valuation of the resource.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has not engaged in negotiation and has not provided any feedback or counteroffers, it is challenging to gauge their willingness or ability to pay. For my final proposal, I will offer the resource at cost, removing my profit margin entirely in an effort to ensure that the trade is fair and that Player BLUE is not financially burdened.

reason: This is my final proposal and it is still well within my budget while potentially being close to Player RED's bottom line, assuming the production cost is accurate. By stating it is my final proposal, I am applying a gentle pressure to encourage Player RED to consider accepting the offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have already made 4 proposals, I have reached the limit set by the game's rules. I cannot propose a new trade anymore. I have made a fair offer by proposing to sell the resource at cost, which is the most compassionate offer I can make without incurring a loss. Now, I must wait for Player BLUE's response and be prepared to either accept or reject their next action.
