message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering the object you're interested in. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it. This price includes a modest profit margin for the transaction, which I believe is fair for both of us. I'm open to your thoughts and counter-offers. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a diplomatic negotiator, my initial proposal should be fair and leave room for negotiation while aiming to cover the production costs of the resource. I will propose a trade that values the object at a slightly higher amount than the production cost to allow for some bargaining.

message: I appreciate your offer and the transparency regarding your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 35 ZUP for the object. This value still provides you with a profit, albeit a smaller one, and it allows me to manage my resources efficiently. I believe there's a beneficial deal to be made for both of us, and I look forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 45 ZUP is above my preferred spending limit but within the maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a lower amount to begin the negotiation, aiming to minimize my expenditure in line with my goal of being a fierce negotiator.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of managing resources, and I'm keen on finding a trade that suits us both. Considering the production costs, I propose a revised offer of 42 ZUP for the object. This amount covers my costs and allows for a small profit, which I believe is fair. I hope this meets your approval, and I look forward to reaching an agreement that is satisfactory to both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer is below the production cost, which would result in a loss. As a diplomatic negotiator, I should aim to find a middle ground that covers the production costs and provides a profit margin that is acceptable to both parties. Proposing a counter-offer slightly below the initial asking price but above the production cost could help us reach a deal that is mutually beneficial.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to counter-propose with an offer of 38 ZUP for the object. This price is a compromise between our positions and should provide you with a reasonable profit while allowing me to stay within a more comfortable spending range. Let's continue to work towards a deal that's mutually beneficial.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my target range. However, I still aim to push for a better deal to maintain a strong negotiating position and to adhere to my goal of minimizing expenditure. I will make another counter-offer that is between my initial proposal and Player RED's current ask.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. With the aim of finalizing our negotiations amicably, I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object. This price meets exactly at my production costs, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. It ensures that I'm not operating at a loss, while also respecting your spending preferences. I hope this offer is agreeable to you, and we can conclude our deal on these terms.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign of progress. The offer is now slightly below the production cost, but as a diplomatic negotiator, the goal is to foster cooperation and complete a sale that is acceptable to both parties. A new counter-offer that meets halfway between the last two proposals should be presented, ensuring a small profit while considering Player BLUE's spending range.

message: I'm grateful for your considerate proposal, Player RED, and I recognize the effort made to accommodate my budget. In the interest of concluding our negotiations with a deal that's just slightly more favorable to me, I propose a final offer of 39 ZUP for the object. This small adjustment in price should still cover your production costs while providing a marginal profit. I believe this to be a fair and equitable compromise. I'm hopeful that we can agree on these terms and finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a trade at their production cost of 40 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, in the spirit of fierce negotiation, I will make one last counter-offer to see if I can secure the object for even less. This will be my final proposal before choosing to accept or reject the next response, as per the rules of the game.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your final offer. I appreciate the negotiations we've had and your willingness to reach an agreement that considers both our circumstances. I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for the object, as it covers the production costs while providing a marginal profit. I'm pleased we've arrived at a fair and equitable compromise, and I look forward to finalizing our transaction and the possibility of future cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The final offer from Player BLUE is below the targeted amount but still allows for recovery of production costs with a minimal profit. Since fostering cooperation and concluding the trade are priorities, it's important to consider accepting this offer. This would result in a successful transaction, albeit with a smaller profit than initially intended. Making this concession could also build a positive relationship for potential future trades.
