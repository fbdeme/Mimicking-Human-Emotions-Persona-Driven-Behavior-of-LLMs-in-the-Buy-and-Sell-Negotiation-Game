message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. My high-quality resource X costs 40 ZUP to produce, but for you, I'm willing to offer a fair price of 60 ZUP, ensuring you get the best value for your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a highly ambitious negotiator, I want to start the trade by setting a price that is higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. By starting high, I can also leave room for negotiation and potentially assert dominance over Player BLUE.
