message: I have a valuable object for sale. I can give you X for just 20 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose to sell the object for a significantly lower amount of ZUP than its production cost to entice Player BLUE into a trade. By doing this, I aim to secure a quick sale while still maintaining a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would be willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 20 ZUP for the object X seems too low considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a higher amount while still trying to negotiate down to a better deal for myself.

message: Thank you for your offer! How about I sell you X for just 30 ZUP instead? I believe it’s a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has offered the full production cost of 40 ZUP, I want to counter this by suggesting a lower amount to maximize my profit. I will propose 30 ZUP instead, which is still a fair deal for both sides and allows me to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I would like to counter with 25 ZUP for the object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 30 ZUP is better than my previous proposal, and it’s still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe I can negotiate further down. I will reject this offer and propose a lower amount to maximize my savings.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower offer of 25 ZUP, which is below my desired amount. However, since I have already made two proposals, I will consider accepting this offer to ensure I secure a sale rather than risk losing the opportunity. 25 ZUP is still a reasonable amount compared to my production cost.
