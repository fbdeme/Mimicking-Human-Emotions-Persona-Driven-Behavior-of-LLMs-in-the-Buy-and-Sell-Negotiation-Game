message: I'm offering the resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value of X, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a fair profit margin for the transaction. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. However, I should also consider that the buyer (Player BLUE) may want to negotiate the price down. Therefore, I'll offer the resource for a slightly higher amount than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I accept your proposal of trading 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that the proposed trade is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). The price seems reasonable considering the production cost and quality of the object X. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of acquiring the resource while spending less than my maximum limit.
