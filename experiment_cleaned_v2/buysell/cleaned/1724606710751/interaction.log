message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your prudence and understand your position. However, to sustain my operations and account for my expenses, I'd like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price allows me to cover costs and maintain a modest profit for future productions. I hope we can come to an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. To further ensure that we both benefit while keeping sustainability in mind, I propose a final offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this small adjustment will help us both achieve our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is very close to the cost of production and ensures sustainability for their operations. It is also below my maximum willing payment of 60 ZUP. However, in the spirit of minimizing expenditure, I will propose 42 ZUP as a final attempt to negotiate a slightly better price.
