message: I am willing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I at least break even on the sale, so I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP for X. This gives me a bit of profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer of 50 ZUP for the object X. I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for the object. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade amount than what RED is asking to see if they are willing to negotiate and possibly agree to a more favorable trade for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To make this work for both of us, how about we agree on 48 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I would like a bit more profit. I will counter with an offer of 48 ZUP to see if we can meet halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I believe we are close to an agreement. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the object X? This price is closer to your initial ask and still within a range that works for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I believe there is still room for negotiation, so I will propose a slightly lower amount than 48 ZUP to reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price. Let's finalize the deal at 47 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 47 ZUP is very reasonable and provides a small profit margin above my production cost of 40 ZUP. I am inclined to accept this offer to close the deal.
