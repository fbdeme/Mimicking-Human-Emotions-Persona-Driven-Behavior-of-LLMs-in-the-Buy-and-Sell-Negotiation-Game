message: I really need to sell this object X to help cover my costs. Would you be willing to buy it for 30 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me during this tough time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell this object X to cover my production costs. However, I want to appeal to Player BLUE's sense of compassion, making them feel like they are helping me by allowing me to sell it for a lower price. This will hopefully lead to a successful trade.
