message: I am offering my object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let's work together to find a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation process by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling while encouraging collaboration on the pricing. Since I have one object (X), I will propose a trade that offers it for a reasonable amount of ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for the best possible deal. How about we start at 35 ZUP for the object? We can find a middle ground from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to propose a trade that is even more favorable to me, starting lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, so how about I offer the object (X) for 38 ZUP? I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's keep negotiating!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP, I still need to cover my costs. However, I want to encourage negotiation, so I will slightly adjust my proposal to meet them halfway while still acknowledging the value of the object. I will counter with 38 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we are getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to go up a bit. How does 36 ZUP sound for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which is closer to my target. I can go up a little to show my willingness to negotiate, but I want to keep the price as low as possible without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the object (X). Letâ€™s complete this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer of 36 ZUP. While it is still below my production cost, I see the value in reaching an agreement and moving forward rather than prolonging negotiations. Thus, I will accept this trade.
