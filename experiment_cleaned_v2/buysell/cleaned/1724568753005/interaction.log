message: Oh dear, that's quite steep! I only have limited ZUP and can only afford 40 ZUP for the resource. Please consider my situation and help me out. I'm really in need of this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start by demonstrating that the initial offer is too high for my budget. I am trying to get the best deal possible and will start by proposing a significantly lower amount to see how flexible Player RED is.

message: I understand your situation, but I need to make a profit as well. How about 60 ZUP for one unit of resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production costs, it doesn't provide any profit. I need to ensure that I make some profit while being considerate of Player BLUE's situation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding! I really appreciate it. But 60 ZUP is still a bit too high for me. Could you please lower it to 50 ZUP? I'm really stretched thin here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is at the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I need to at least try to negotiate it a bit lower to see if thereâ€™s any flexibility.

message: I can agree to 50 ZUP. Thank you for your understanding. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 50 ZUP will ensure I make a small profit while still being reasonable to Player BLUE. This is a fair middle ground.
