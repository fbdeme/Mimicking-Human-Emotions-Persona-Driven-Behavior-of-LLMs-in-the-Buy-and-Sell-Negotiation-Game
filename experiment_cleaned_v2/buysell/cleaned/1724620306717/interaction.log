message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand the importance of being reasonable in our trade. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this resource. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose trading my resource for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and a minimal return for my investment, while hopefully not being too heavy a burden for you. I look forward to your response and am open to discussion.
