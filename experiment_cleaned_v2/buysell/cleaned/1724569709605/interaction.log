message: Thank you for your offer. I propose 30 ZUP for your X. Let's continue to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to spend the least ZUP possible. Therefore, I will make a counter-proposal to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. However, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I propose 50 ZUP for X. Let's continue to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is too low as it doesn't cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving some room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your response. I understand your production costs. I propose 40 ZUP for X as a compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 50 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should aim to negotiate for a lower price. I will make a counter-offer that is slightly higher than my previous one to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my production costs. I propose 45 ZUP for X as a final compromise to ensure a small profit. Hopefully, we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches my production costs, which means I will break even but not make a profit. Since my goal is to at least make a profit, I will propose 45 ZUP as a final negotiation to ensure some profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
