I have room for one more counter-proposal before I must decide to accept or reject. I will propose a price that is at my maximum willingness to pay, thus giving Player RED the impression that this is my final offer without explicitly stating it. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad we are working towards an agreement. As a gesture of good faith and in recognition of the quality of X, I'm willing to meet you at my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for X: 1. This offer is a significant move towards your asking price, and I hope it exemplifies my willingness to finalize our deal. </message>"
