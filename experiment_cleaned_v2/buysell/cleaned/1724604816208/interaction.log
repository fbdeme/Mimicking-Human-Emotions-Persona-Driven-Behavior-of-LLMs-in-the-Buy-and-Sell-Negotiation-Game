Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm in a bit of a tight spot right now, and these resources would really help me out. I can offer 45 ZUP, which is a fair amount given my situation. I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resources for at most 60 ZUP, I've proposed a trade for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. This will allow me room to negotiate and also appear slightly desperate, which aligns with my strategy to seem vulnerable in the hope that Player RED will sympathize and accept a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but I believe the fair value for the object is 48 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering the amount I initially proposed. I will try to negotiate for a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding, and while 48 ZUP is closer to what I can manage, it's still a bit steep for my current predicament. Could we settle on 47 ZUP instead? I'm really hoping we can make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED counter-offered with 48 ZUP, which is still within the range I'm willing to pay. However, I want to maintain the appearance of vulnerability and try to secure the resources for even less. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer that is closer to my initial proposal but still provides a compromise.
