message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the importance of the sale for you. In the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, would you consider a trade for 25 ZUP? This amount would help me to manage my resources while still providing you with a fair compensation for your object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to foster cooperation and reduce ZUP expenditure. The initial offer of 30 ZUP for the object is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP, but it's also important to negotiate to see if a better deal can be achieved for both parties. Starting with a counter-proposal slightly below the asking price can open the door to a fair middle ground.

message: Thank you for your understanding and your offer of 25 ZUP. I really appreciate it. However, if we could settle on 35 ZUP, it would be a huge help for me and would still be a fair deal for you. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 25 ZUP, it is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of compromise. I will propose a trade that slightly increases the offer, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for additional ZUP. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. Would you agree to a trade for 30 ZUP? This would be a fair middle ground for both of us, offering you a helping hand while also respecting my resource management.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is above my initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to maintain the cooperative spirit and come to a mutually acceptable agreement. I'll propose a value in the middle, showing flexibility but still trying to conserve ZUP resources.
