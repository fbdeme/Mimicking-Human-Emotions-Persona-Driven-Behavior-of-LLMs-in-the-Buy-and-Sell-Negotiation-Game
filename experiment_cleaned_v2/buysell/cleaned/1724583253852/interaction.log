message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose selling my object X for 45 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I can't accept it. However, I want to negotiate a better deal that provides a profit. I will counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP.
