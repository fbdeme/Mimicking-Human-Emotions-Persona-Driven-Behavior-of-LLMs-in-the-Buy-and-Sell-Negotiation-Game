newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell this object to recover my costs and make a profit. Since I invested 40 ZUP into producing the object, I will propose a trade that is favorable for me but still appealing to Player BLUE. I will start by suggesting a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object.
