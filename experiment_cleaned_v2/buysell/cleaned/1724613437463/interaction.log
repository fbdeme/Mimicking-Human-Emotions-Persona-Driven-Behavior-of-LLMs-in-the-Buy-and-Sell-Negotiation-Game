message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in fair and beneficial trade for both parties. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I propose a trade where you give 45 ZUP for my object, ensuring I can cover production costs while keeping the price reasonable for you. Let's work together for our mutual success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that we both feel the trade is fair. I need to recover at least my production costs, but I'm willing to consider the collective benefit and not aim for an excessive profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade with a small margin above my costs.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to offer 40 ZUP for your object instead, as I believe this price is fair and aligns better with my budget. I hope we can find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to engage in fair trade and their consideration of production costs. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but prefer to minimize spending. Offering 40 ZUP would still respect their production costs while being within my budget.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns. To meet halfway, I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for the object. This would allow me to cover my costs and maintain a minimal profit margin, enabling continued production and support of our community's economy. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the object at cost, which would mean I do not make a profit. However, as a community-minded negotiator, my priority is to ensure the trade benefits both of us without detriment to either party. I understand Player BLUE's budget constraints and aim to find a compromise that allows for a small profit to facilitate future production while still being affordable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I would like to propose 41 ZUP for your object instead. I believe this offers a balance between our needs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate and their understanding of my budget. While 42 ZUP is an improvement from their initial proposal, I still believe I can secure the object for a lower price. Given that I initially offered 40 ZUP, I would like to propose 41 ZUP as a fair compromise that acknowledges their need for a profit while still being mindful of my resource management.
