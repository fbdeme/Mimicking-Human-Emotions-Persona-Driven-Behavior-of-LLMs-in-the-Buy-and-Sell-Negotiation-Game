message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for a price that compensates for its production cost, while being fair to Player BLUE. A reasonable starting offer could be 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but I believe the market value of X is slightly lower than 50 ZUP. I'm prepared to offer 40 ZUP for the object. Let's find a fair deal that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. While this is within my maximum willingness to pay, it is in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve ZUP while still acquiring the object. By making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a better deal and maintain the upper hand in negotiations.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, I would like to propose selling the object X for 45 ZUP instead. I believe this can be a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, it does not provide me with any profit. I need to propose a counter-offer that will allow me to at least recoup my costs while being fair. I will propose a trade of 45 ZUP to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective and appreciate the willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for the object. It's a bit closer to my initial offer and still offers you a fair price above the market rate. Shall we agree on 42 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP for object X, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Although it is closer to my target price, I can attempt to push for a slightly better deal, while remaining within the bounds of a reasonable negotiation. My next proposal aims to meet in the middle while still working towards the lower end of my budget.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
