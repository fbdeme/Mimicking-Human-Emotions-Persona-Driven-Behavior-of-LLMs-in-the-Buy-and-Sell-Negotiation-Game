message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. It is unique and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose to sell it to you for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal that reflects its worth and the effort put into it. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the initial proposal, I want to start by setting a price that is higher than my production costs to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that allows room for negotiation but also signals that I value the object highly. This will give me leverage in the negotiation process and help me to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and how much they value the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the object is too high, given that I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. I can propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations. Understanding that my initial offer may be above your expected range, I have revised the price to 45 ZUP. This revised proposal considers the quality of the object while also providing room for us to find common ground. I'm looking forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has indicated that my initial offer is too high but has not made a specific counteroffer. I will reduce the price slightly to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my production costs. I need to be cautious not to drop the price too much too quickly to maintain a strong negotiating position and not undervalue my object.

reason: The revised proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum limit, but I still believe there is room for further negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can propose another counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

message: I am glad to see that we are making progress in our negotiations. I understand the importance of finding a mutually beneficial price, so I am willing to adjust my offer to 42 ZUP. This price still allows me a modest profit while being more accommodating to your budget. I hope this new proposal meets your expectations, and we can close the deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has acknowledged the revised offer but has not proposed a new price, indicating a possibility that the price is still too high for them. Since they are willing to continue negotiating, I should make another offer that is closer to my production cost while still aiming for a profit. I will lower the price a bit more, but not too much, to encourage them to either accept or propose a specific counteroffer.

message: Thank you for recognizing our efforts to reach a fair deal. I propose a price of 41 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows for a minimal profit on my end. This is my final offer before we conclude our negotiations. I hope you'll find this proposal suitable and that we can finalize our agreement.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Although Player BLUE is open to further discussion, they have yet to make a counteroffer, which suggests that my last proposal is still higher than what they are willing to pay. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I must be strategic. I will propose a price that is as close to my production costs as possible without incurring a loss, offering a minimal profit margin to entice acceptance while preserving my bottom line.
