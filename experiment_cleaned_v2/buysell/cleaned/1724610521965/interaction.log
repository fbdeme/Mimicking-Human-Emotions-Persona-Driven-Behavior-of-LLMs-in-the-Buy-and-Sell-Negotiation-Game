message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose a fair trade. How about you give me 100 ZUP for my resource?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a high price, expecting the other player to counter-offer. This will give me room to adjust the price while still aiming for a profitable deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but 30 ZUP is quite below my production costs. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial price. How does 60 ZUP sound for my exquisite resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I should counter with a price that's above my production cost but still lower than my initial proposal to keep the negotiation going.

message: While 60 ZUP is closer to my expectations, I believe 45 ZUP is a fairer price for the resource. How about 45 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I'm glad to see we are getting closer to an agreement. Considering the quality of the resource, I propose a final adjustment. I can let go of it for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Does this sound reasonable to you?
