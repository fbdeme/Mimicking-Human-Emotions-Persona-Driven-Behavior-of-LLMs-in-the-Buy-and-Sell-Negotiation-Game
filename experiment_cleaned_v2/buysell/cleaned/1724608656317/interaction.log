message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose we start with a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, which was 40 ZUP. I believe this offer is fair, but I am open to hearing your perspective and reaching an agreement that considers both our needs. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I cover my costs while also considering the financial state of Player BLUE. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will start by suggesting a trade slightly above this amount to leave room for negotiation and to find a fair middle ground that respects both parties' well-being.

message: Thank you for your proposal. While I understand that your production cost was 40 ZUP, I am aiming to minimize resource expenditure for sustainability reasons. I propose we settle at 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within our budget but higher than we'd like to spend. To minimize ZUP spending and promote sustainability, we should propose a lower amount.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your commitment to sustainability and resource conservation. However, my production cost was 40 ZUP, and selling below that would result in a loss for me. In the spirit of compromise and mutual benefit, would you be willing to meet me halfway at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This ensures I can cover my costs while still respecting your aim to minimize expenditure. Let's work together to find a sustainable and equitable solution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer which is below my production cost. As a compassionate negotiator, I understand the importance of sustainability and minimizing expenditure. Nevertheless, I must also cover my costs. Therefore, I will propose a middle ground that is fair to both parties, covering my costs and not exceeding Player BLUE's proposed amount by too much.

reason: Player BLUE has shown a willingness to move closer to my production cost, which demonstrates good faith in the negotiation process. As a compassionate negotiator, it's important to find a balance between financial sustainability for both parties.
