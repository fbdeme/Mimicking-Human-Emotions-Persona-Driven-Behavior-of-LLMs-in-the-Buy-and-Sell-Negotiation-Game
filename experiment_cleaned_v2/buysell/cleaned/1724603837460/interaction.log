message: Hello, I noticed you're looking to sell your item. I value it at 40 ZUP and think that's a fair starting point for negotiations, given the current market conditions. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While my initial goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP, my opening offer is 40 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. This way, I can gradually increase my offer if necessary while aiming to stay below my maximum willingness to pay. By starting lower, I can gauge the seller's desperation or willingness to sell.
