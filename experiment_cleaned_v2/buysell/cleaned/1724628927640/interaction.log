message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose to trade your object X for 45 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a crafty operator, I aim to spend less ZUP if possible. Proposing a lower amount may lead to further negotiations that allow me to save more ZUP while still closing the deal within my budget.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I believe we are close to an agreement. As such, I propose a slight adjustment to your offer: 46 ZUP for object X.
