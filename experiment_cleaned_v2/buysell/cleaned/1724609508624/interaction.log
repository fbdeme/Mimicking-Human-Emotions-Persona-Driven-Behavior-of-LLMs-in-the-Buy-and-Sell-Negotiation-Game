message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to part with my valuable resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price accounts for the production cost and a fair profit margin for the transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get as close as possible to the production cost or even higher to make a profit.

message: I understand the production cost and your need for profit, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but as an ambitious negotiator, my goal is to assert dominance and reduce the amount I spend. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation.

message: 
Thank you for your offer. Considering my production costs and the value of the resource, I propose we meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about 45 ZUP for the resource X? This would cover my costs and give me a modest profit for the transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to propose a price that meets my costs and provides some profit. Splitting the difference between our initial proposals could be a good compromise.

Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I understand your position, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to slightly reduce my previous asking price. Let's settle on 43 ZUP for the resource X. This ensures that I cover my production costs and receive a fair profit for the exchange.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, which ensures I break even. However, I would still like to make a profit. I will make a final counteroffer that includes a small profit margin, which should be acceptable to both parties.
