message: Hello Player RED, I value our shared interest in fair trade and sustainable practices. I propose an initial offer of 35 ZUP for the object you're selling. This ensures a balanced exchange that reflects both our needs. Let's work together to come to an agreeable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a lower offer than the maximum willingness to pay leaves room for negotiation and ensures resources are spent efficiently. By offering 35 ZUP, there is still a cushion for potential counteroffers while aligning with the goal of preserving resources for future generations.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your costs and I'm willing to move towards a compromise. How about we meet halfway and I offer 50 ZUP for the object? This should help in covering your costs while still maintaining a sustainable and fair transaction for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
