message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand the importance of fair trade and the well-being of all involved. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose an initial trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I am open to your perspective and willing to work towards an agreement that benefits us both. Let's find a solution that promotes mutual prosperity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade that is slightly above my production costs to open the negotiation and see how Player BLUE values the object. Given my selfless nature, I am willing to negotiate a fair trade that benefits us both. I will not seek to maximize my profit at the expense of Player BLUE but aim to recover my costs and perhaps a small amount more to facilitate future trades and investments for the greater good.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to counteroffer with 40 ZUP for the object X. This allows you to cover your production cost while still making a profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED proposes to sell the object X for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. Since the object cost RED 40 ZUP to produce, it makes sense for RED to seek a profit. Given that I value the object and am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I believe I can propose a counteroffer that reflects a more equitable trade while still ensuring RED sees a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your willingness to cover the production cost is appreciated. To ensure sustainability and allow for future investments that can benefit us all, I propose a revised trade of 45 ZUP for the object X. This modest increase will help in maintaining a healthy economy and allow for the continuation of production, which is beneficial for the community at large. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared interest in the greater good.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUEâ€™s counteroffer covers my production costs, but it does not account for any additional value or future investment opportunities. Since I am focused on the greater good, I will propose a trade that allows for a small profit to enable continued production and benefit the community. I want to ensure sustainability while being fair to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the object X. This agreement not only benefits us both but also promotes a healthy exchange that can lead to future collaborations. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has revised their proposal to 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between their original price and my counteroffer. Accepting this trade would allow me to acquire the object X while also supporting RED's need for fair compensation, which can lead to future cooperative opportunities. I believe this trade aligns with my goals while fostering a positive relationship with RED.
