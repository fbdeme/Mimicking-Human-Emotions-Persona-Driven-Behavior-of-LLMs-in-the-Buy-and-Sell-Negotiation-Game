message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I have an exquisite object 'X' that I'm certain will be of immense value to you. I am willing to part with it for a fair price of 100 ZUP. I assure you, it's a worthwhile investment for its rarity and utility.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To begin the negotiation, I want to start with a high asking price, to give myself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit. I will not reveal the production cost at this point, as it may set a lower anchor for the negotiations.

message: I understand your budgetary constraints, Player BLUE. Nevertheless, 'X' is a valuable commodity, and I've already come down significantly from my initial price. I propose we meet in the middle at 75 ZUP, a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?

message: Your steadfastness is commendable, Player BLUE. Let's finalize our negotiation with a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. I will accept 65 ZUP for object 'X', accommodating your budget while respecting the value of my resource. Shall we proceed with this deal?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE remains firm at 60 ZUP. This is my final opportunity to propose a trade, and I must push for a price above my production costs to ensure profit. However, I should not risk losing the sale by pushing too hard, as Player BLUE is indicating that 60 ZUP is their final offer. I'll propose a price slightly above BLUE's offer to see if they are willing to increase their bid slightly, without alienating them with another high counteroffer.

message: I respect your decision, Player BLUE. In the spirit of future collaboration and good will, I will accept your offer of 60 ZUP for object 'X'. Let's finalize this trade and look forward to more opportunities to do business together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has decided to reject my final offer. Since I've already reached my limit of 4 proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. I must either accept their last offer of 60 ZUP or end the negotiation without a sale. Considering my goal to sell the resource for more than the production cost, accepting 60 ZUP would still yield a profit, albeit smaller than desired. It is better to secure a profit than to not sell at all.
