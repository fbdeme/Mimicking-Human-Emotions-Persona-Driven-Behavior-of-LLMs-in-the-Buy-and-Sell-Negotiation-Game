message: I'm willing to sell the object for 100 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you, or feel free to counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I sell the resource for more than the production cost of 40 ZUP to make a profit. It's reasonable to start with a higher offer to give myself room to negotiate downwards if necessary.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Player RED, 60 ZUP is still a bit tight for me. How about 50 ZUP? I'm really stretching my budget here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing a price at the maximum limit of my budget. While this is within my acceptable range, I will try to negotiate a slightly lower price to save some resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer that is below my maximum budget. However, I will make one last attempt to lower the price a bit more.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
