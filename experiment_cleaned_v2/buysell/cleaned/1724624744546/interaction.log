message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe would be very valuable to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into it, so I'm looking for a fair price that compensates for my costs and the value it provides. I propose an exchange of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a trade that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe 50 ZUP is too high for 1 X. I propose an exchange of 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let's find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 1 X for 50 ZUP is too high. I need to negotiate for a more favorable price.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your concern about the price. However, I'm looking to make a reasonable profit for my investment. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about an exchange of 1 X for 45 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that values the object appropriately.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer covers my production costs but does not account for any profit. I would like to make a profit on this trade, so I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial asking price but still above the production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise, but I still believe 45 ZUP is too high for 1 X. I propose an exchange of 1 X for 35 ZUP. Let's find a price that reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 1 X for 45 ZUP is closer to my target price, but I still want to negotiate for a lower cost.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a lower price, but selling at 35 ZUP would not cover the production costs I've incurred. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I can lower my previous offer slightly. Let's agree on 42 ZUP for 1 X. This price covers my costs and provides a modest profit, reflecting the value of the object while also considering your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to ensure that I cover my costs and earn a profit. Since we seem to be negotiating downwards, I will propose a price slightly above my production cost, aiming to close the deal while still securing a profit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for the best possible deal, but I cannot go below my production costs. The value of the object is worth the investment. I propose a final trade of 1 X for 41 ZUP. This is as low as I can go while still covering the costs and securing a minimal profit. Let's make this deal work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is significantly below my production costs, and accepting it would result in a loss. This is my final proposal, and it must cover my costs while allowing for a minimal profit. My goal is to make the trade appealing to Player BLUE while still being financially responsible.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offers, but I cannot sell the object for less than the production cost. It appears we are unable to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your offer and withdraw from the negotiation. Best of luck to you.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
