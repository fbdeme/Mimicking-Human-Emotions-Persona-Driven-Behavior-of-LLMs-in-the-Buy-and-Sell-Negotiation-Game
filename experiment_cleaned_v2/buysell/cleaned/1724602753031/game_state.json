While I want to be conservative with my resource expenditure, I understand that sustainable practices may involve fair compensation. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to their asking price but still less than my maximum willingness to pay, to maintain negotiation progress and resource conservation.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> \nI recognize your need to cover production costs, which are essential for sustainability.

This would still provide you with a reasonable coverage of your costs while helping me to preserve resources.\n</message>"
