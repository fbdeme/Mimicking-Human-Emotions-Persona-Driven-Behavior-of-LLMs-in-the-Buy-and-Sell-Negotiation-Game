message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my object (X) for 40 ZUP, which reflects the cost of production. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X) to sell, I aim to maximize my ZUP return. I will propose an initial trade that reflects the production cost of the object.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the object, but I would like to start our negotiation at 30 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price is 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation with the aim of saving ZUP from my budget. If Player RED counters with a higher price, there is still room for negotiation without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your interest, Player BLUE! How about we meet halfway? I propose to sell you the object (X) for 35 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost, and I am looking to negotiate a better price. I will propose a counter-offer that is more reasonable while still aiming for cooperation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the counteroffer! How about we settle at 32 ZUP? It's a bit closer to your proposed price and still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is closer to the initial offer I made and still within my budget. I still aim to negotiate a better deal, ideally lower than 35 ZUP to save on resources, while keeping in mind that the counteroffer is already reasonable. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still less than 35 ZUP to continue the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player BLUE! I can offer you the object (X) for 34 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your offer of 32 ZUP, which is closer to my cost, but I still need to ensure I am not losing too much on the sale. I will propose a slight adjustment to my initial price to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I think we're almost there! Let's go for 33 ZUP. It's just a small step down and it would be a great agreement for both sides. Looking forward to finalizing our deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 34 ZUP, which is close to my last offer and still under the maximum amount I am willing to pay. As this is my third proposal, I want to approach my final offer while trying to maintain a favorable position in the negotiation. Proposing 33 ZUP would show my willingness to close the deal while still attempting to conserve resources.
