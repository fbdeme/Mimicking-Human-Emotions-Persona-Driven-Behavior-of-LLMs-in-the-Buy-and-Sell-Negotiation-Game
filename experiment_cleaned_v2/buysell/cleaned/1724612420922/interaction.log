message: I appreciate your budget considerations. I've adjusted my asking price to 42 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. This price ensures a quality product while also respecting your budget. Please consider this fair middle ground.

reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my production cost, so I would be at a loss if I accepted it. However, I recognize the need to compromise to make a sale. I will propose a price that's in the middle, which allows me to make a profit while also considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.
