Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more favorable middle ground. I propose a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the one unit of X. This still provides you with a reasonable profit over your production cost.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and try to reduce the ZUP I spend. The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum I'm willing to pay. I will counter with a lower offer to open negotiations and see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, I still cover my costs and we both benefit more fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP still provides a profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, aiming to improve the overall outcome, I would like to suggest a slightly higher amount that can benefit both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach, but let's settle on 53 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your asking price and still gives you a comfortable margin above your production costs.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a dominant negotiator, I want to push for a slightly better deal. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can still stay within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED while preserving my negotiating position and attempting to save some ZUP.
