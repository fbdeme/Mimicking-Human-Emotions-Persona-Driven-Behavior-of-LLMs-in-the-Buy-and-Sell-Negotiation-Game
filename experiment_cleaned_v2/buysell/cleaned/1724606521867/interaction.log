message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production cost and the value of collaboration, I propose an exchange where you give 50 ZUP for my resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a negotiator who values teamwork and collaboration, my initial proposal will be slightly above my production cost to start the negotiations on a positive note, while leaving room for adjustments based on Player BLUE's response. I will propose a trade of 50 ZUP which gives me a modest profit margin, but still within a range that could be acceptable to both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I value our collaborative effort and understand that you're looking for a fair deal. To meet halfway, I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal. Let's consider a trade where you provide 45 ZUP for my resource X. This slight increase from your offer ensures a reasonable profit for my investment while still honoring our partnership. What are your thoughts on this compromise?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-proposal and willingness to negotiate. Since their offer matches my production cost, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit that justifies the sale. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial proposals. This should demonstrate flexibility and maintain the collaborative spirit of our negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am pleased we are making strides towards strengthening our collaboration. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my resource X. This deal is agreeable and beneficial for both of us, and I look forward to further partnerships in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. However, the proposed amount is still slightly above my production cost, meaning the profit margin is very slim. To foster our ongoing collaboration and conclude our negotiation positively, I will accept this proposal. This maintains goodwill for future interactions and respects the collaborative spirit we've established.
