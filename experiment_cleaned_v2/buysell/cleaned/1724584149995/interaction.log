message: I am willing to sell my resource X for 40 ZUP. This reflects the cost of production and I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that reflects the value of the object and my costs, while also being reasonable to encourage negotiation. Since I need to sell the object to recover my costs, I will propose selling the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. This is a good starting point for negotiation.

message: I agree to your proposal of exchanging 40 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource. Additionally, the price of 40 ZUP is reasonable, and I believe this is a fair deal for both parties.
