message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you give me 40 ZUP for the object I have for sale. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I have. Since I only have 1 object and I need to cover my production cost, I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP for the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am interested in the object, but I would like to propose a revised trade where I give you 30 ZUP for it. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, as a calculating negotiator, I aim to acquire the object for even less to maximize my personal gain. Therefore, I will counteroffer with a lower amount of ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, I cannot accept it as it does not cover my production cost. How about we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 30 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it does not cover my expenses. However, I can counteroffer to meet halfway and propose 35 ZUP, which is still a loss but closer to my goal.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering costs, Player RED. I propose a price of 32 ZUP for the object. This is a competitive offer that takes into consideration both our positions. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. Since this is still within my maximum willingness to pay, I can afford to go a bit higher without exceeding my limit. I want to propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below Player RED's counteroffer to see if there's room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but unfortunately, 32 ZUP is still not feasible for me. How about we settle at 34 ZUP? This is my final counteroffer. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While I appreciate the effort to come up with a competitive offer, I need to ensure I minimize my losses. I will propose 34 ZUP as a final counteroffer before needing to make a decision.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your final counteroffer of 34 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated that 34 ZUP is their final counteroffer. This is only 2 ZUP above my previous offer and still within my acceptable range. Since this is my third proposal and Player RED seems firm on their stance, it may be strategic to accept this offer to ensure a successful negotiation without risking a breakdown in talks.
