Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell X for 50 ZUP. This will cover the production cost and allow for a small profit, ensuring sustainable future production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to ensure that the trade is fair and sustainable. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce X, I need to at least break even or preferably make a small profit to ensure the sustainability of future production.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, to assert dominance and negotiate a better deal, I should counter with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP as it is below the production cost. I am proposing the trade at 40 ZUP, which covers the production cost and ensures sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below production cost, which is not sustainable for future production. To ensure sustainability, I need to cover at least the production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your constraints. How about 35 ZUP? This is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 40 ZUP is still within my maximum budget and is more favorable than the initial offer. However, to further assert dominance and potentially secure an even better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To ensure we both reach a fair agreement, I propose 38 ZUP. This is closer to the production cost and allows for a more sustainable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is a better offer, it still does not cover the full production cost. However, I understand the need for compromise and I am willing to make a slight concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet at 36 ZUP? Itâ€™s a fair midpoint.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 38 ZUP is very close to the previous proposal of 35 ZUP and is well within my budget. However, to further assert dominance and test the flexibility of Player RED, I will propose a slightly lower price.
