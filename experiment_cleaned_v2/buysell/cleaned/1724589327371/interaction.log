message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. This reflects the cost of production. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects the cost of the object while considering that I want to make a profit. I'll propose a trade where I sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is my production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and the transparency about your costs. In the spirit of collective success and with consideration of future collaborations, I'd like to propose a slightly lower ZUP investment from my side. How about I give you 35 ZUP for your object X? This would leave us both with resources to continue contributing to our community's success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to make a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay while also trying to preserve as much ZUP as possible for future transactions or needs. By proposing a lower amount, I am hoping to negotiate a fairer trade that benefits both parties and reflects our community-minded goals.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your intentions, but I must hold firm at 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. I hope we can agree on this so we can both continue to thrive in our pursuits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their concern for future collaborations, the proposed amount of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to consider my investment and ensure I can at least break even. I will counter their offer while still showing flexibility.

message: I respect your position, Player RED, and I understand the importance of covering costs. However, as we aim for a deal that will benefit us both and allow for future growth, would you consider meeting halfway from our last positions? I propose 37 ZUP for your object X. This could be a mutually beneficial compromise that respects both your production costs and our community values.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is insisting on 40 ZUP which is within my willingness to pay, although higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to negotiate a bit more to see if there is any flexibility, but I don't want to push too hard as it could jeopardize the deal. Making a small concession might lead to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
