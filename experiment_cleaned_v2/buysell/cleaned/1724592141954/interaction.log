message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I believe in a fair trade that benefits us both. Would you consider selling the object X for 35 ZUP? This way, we can ensure that we are both moving towards our collective goals while maintaining a good reserve of resources for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal range, but as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to minimize the ZUP spent while also encouraging collective success. Thus, I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to save resources but still keep the offer fair and appealing to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I cannot sell the object X for less than 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. Would you be willing to meet my asking price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal of 35 ZUP, I cannot accept it as it is below the cost of producing the resource, which was 40 ZUP. To make the trade viable for me, I need to propose a counter-offer that is closer to my production cost.
