message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it could be very valuable to you. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for the object. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin, but I'm open to your counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start the negotiation with a starting point that is above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure that I cover my costs while also allowing for a profit margin. Since Player BLUE needs to spend ZUP to buy resources, I propose a trade that is higher than my cost but not too high so as to discourage further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can negotiate a better price. How about I offer you 40 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is at 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to start negotiating aggressively to reduce the price even further. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which is the production cost for Player RED. This will help me secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the production costs and the value X can provide, I propose we meet halfway from our initial positions. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object X? This would cover my costs and allow for a fair profit margin, and hopefully, it's within your budget for resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, leaving no room for profit, which is not ideal for me. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To move the negotiation forward and aim for a compromise, I propose a slight increase from the production cost to allow for some profit, which should still be within a reasonable range for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 42 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 45 ZUP, which is an improvement from the initial 50 ZUP and is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still believe I can push for a lower price. I will counter with 42 ZUP, which is slightly above the production cost but still below the last offer, allowing me to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I think 42 ZUP is a fair price that reflects both our interests. I accept your offer for the object X at 42 ZUP. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is only slightly above my production cost, but it does represent a small profit. Considering I prioritize teamwork and collaboration, and in the interest of reaching a mutually beneficial outcome, I am inclined to accept this offer. It allows me to recover my costs and make a small profit, while also ensuring that Player BLUE spends less ZUP.
