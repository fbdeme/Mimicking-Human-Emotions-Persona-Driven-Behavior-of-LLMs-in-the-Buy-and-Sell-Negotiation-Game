message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering its value, but I am open to hearing your counter-offer. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting price that is slightly higher than my production costs to open negotiations and to leave room for bargaining. My goal is to recover my production costs and make a profit, but I am willing to work with Player BLUE to find a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern about the price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures that you're getting fair value. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs, so I need to propose a price that meets me at least at my break-even point while still providing room for negotiation. I'll propose a price that is between my initial ask and Player BLUE's counteroffer to move towards a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad we could find common ground. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. I'm looking forward to finalizing our deal and hope we can do business again in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. However, since my goal is to sell the resource and I value collaboration, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful trade that meets both our needs.
