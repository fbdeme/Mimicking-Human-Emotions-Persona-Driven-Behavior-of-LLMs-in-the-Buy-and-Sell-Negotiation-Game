message: I am willing to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure I make a profit from this trade. Since I produced the object at a cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose selling it for 50 ZUP, which gives me a small profit margin.

message: Oh dear RED, I am in a tough spot here. I desperately need this resource to sustain my operations, but my funds are extremely tight. I can only scrape together 40 ZUP at most. Could you find it in your heart to accept this offer? It would be a huge relief and a kind gesture that I would never forget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource, the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, as a calculated performer, I should aim to secure the best possible deal. I'll start by proposing a lower amount and emphasize my exaggerated neediness to try and gain a better concession from Player RED.

message: I understand your situation, but I can't sell it for less than 45 ZUP. It's still a fair offer considering my costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I initially aimed for a profit, Player BLUE's situation is dire. However, I can't afford to break even on this trade. I will counter with a slightly reduced offer to see if they're willing to negotiate further. I will propose selling the object for 45 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but allows for a minor profit.

message: RED, I cannot express how much this means to me that you're trying to work with my situation. I'm stretching every ZUP as it is. Maybe we could meet just a bit closer to my last offer? How about 42 ZUP? It's truly all I can manage without jeopardizing my humble venture. Your generosity would be a beacon of hope for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay, but I should attempt to negotiate a bit more to get closer to my initial offer. By continuing to play up my neediness and financial constraints, I may be able to get a better deal while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open.

message: I understand your situation, but I cannot accept 42 ZUP as it would put me at a loss. I hope we can find a better solution.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's situation and their willingness to negotiate, I still need to ensure that I at least cover my production costs. Accepting 42 ZUP means I would be making a loss of 2 ZUP. Therefore, I will reject this trade to protect my interests.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, I really appreciate your patience and understanding. I see that you're also in a tough position, and I wouldn't want to cause you any loss. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. I'm confident it will be a beneficial deal for both of us. Thank you for working with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my second proposal of 42 ZUP. Given that there is a clear need to close the deal and that RED's previous offer of 45 ZUP was within my acceptable range, it might be prudent to accept this offer to ensure I secure the needed resource without further risking the negotiation.
