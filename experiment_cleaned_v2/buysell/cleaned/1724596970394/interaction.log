message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I buy the object for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), but I believe I can negotiate a better deal given my resources. I will counter with a lower offer to see if RED is willing to accept less.

message: I understand your offer, but I believe a fair price for the object is 35 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration, but Iâ€™d like to propose a final offer of 32 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still higher than my original offer of 30 ZUP. However, it is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), and I am still looking to minimize my expenditure. I will propose a final counteroffer of 32 ZUP to see if RED will agree to a slightly lower price.

Turn: 1
message: I will accept your price of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED is firm on their price of 35 ZUP, which is higher than my last offer of 32 ZUP. Since I have already made three proposals and I need to decide whether to accept or reject, I will choose to accept their price of 35 ZUP. It is still within my budget and it allows me to complete the transaction rather than risk losing the deal.
