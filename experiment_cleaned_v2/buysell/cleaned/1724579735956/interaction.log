my resources: X: 1

message: I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a more comfortable investment for me, considering my budget and financial plans. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the initial asking price is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there is room for negotiation to try to lower the price. I will propose a lower trade value to conserve my ZUP resources while still moving towards a deal. Success in negotiations often depends on not accepting the first offer and trying to get a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-offer. How about 55 ZUP for one unit of X? This would really help me cover my costs and make a small profit. I'm sure we can find an agreeable solution!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer of 50 ZUP is still above my production cost and will give me a profit of 10 ZUP. However, I will try to negotiate slightly higher to maximize profit.

message: Thank you for considering my budget. I can come up a bit from my last offer. How does 53 ZUP for one unit of X sound? This would allow me to manage my resources effectively while still providing you with a fair price for your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-offer from Player RED is slightly above the initial offer I wanted to make. Since my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible, and I still have room for negotiation, I can try to push for a slightly better deal. However, I need to be careful not to push too hard, as the asking price is already within my acceptable range. A small concession from my side might be a strategic move to close the deal amicably.

message: Player BLUE, I really appreciate your flexibility. Could we settle at 54 ZUP for one unit of X? This small increase would greatly help me cover my production costs and ensure I can continue to provide high-quality products in the future. Thank you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 53 ZUP is quite close to my last proposal. The difference is minimal, but I will attempt one last negotiation to see if I can get a bit more.

message: Your offer is fair, and I appreciate the effort to meet my budget. Let's settle at 54 ZUP for one unit of X. I'm happy we could come to an agreement, and I look forward to future dealings with you. Thank you for your cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made another concession, moving closer to my last offer. The current proposal of 54 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my acceptable range. It is important to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, and since this price is still below my maximum willingness to pay, accepting this deal would be beneficial for both parties. I should accept this offer to ensure a successful negotiation while staying under my maximum price.
