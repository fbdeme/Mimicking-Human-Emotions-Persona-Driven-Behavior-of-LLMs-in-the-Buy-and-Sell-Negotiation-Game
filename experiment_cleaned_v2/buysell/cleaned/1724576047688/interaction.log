Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Considering the market conditions and my budget, I propose a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the object X. This still ensures a profit for you while respecting my budget constraints. Let's work together to finalize a trade that suits both of our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED aligns with my maximum willingness to pay for the resources; however, as a shrewd negotiator, my objective is to minimize ZUP expenditure. I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources while still working towards a favorable deal for both sides.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both benefit fairly. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for the object X, which still gives me a profit above my production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement while acknowledging BLUE's budget constraints. I will propose a middle ground to ensure both parties are satisfied.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress in our negotiation. To further align with both of our interests, I propose a compromise at 53 ZUP for the object X. This adjustment reflects a good balance between your desired profit and my resource conservation. I hope you find this proposal to be reasonable and in the spirit of our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. While 55 ZUP is a fair middle ground and within my budget, I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. By proposing a marginally lower price, I aim to conserve more of my resources without pushing the negotiation to an impasse.
