Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to sell X for 60 ZUP. This is a fair deal considering the production costs and the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, preferably more
reason: Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I will start with a proposal that gives me a reasonable profit margin. I will offer X for 60 ZUP, which allows me to gain a profit of 20 ZUP. This is a negotiation, so it's likely that Player BLUE will counter-offer.
