message: I understand the importance of fair trade and mutual benefit. I'm offering you this valuable resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a slightly lower price of 38 ZUP to facilitate this trade and support your endeavors.

message: I appreciate your offer and the fair trade mindset. However, considering the market conditions and to ensure a sustainable partnership, I propose 30 ZUP for the resource. This price still gives you a decent profit margin and helps me manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 38 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a calculating negotiator, my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me but still appears reasonable to Player RED.

message: I value our potential partnership and understand the need for a sustainable agreement. Taking both our positions into account, I propose we meet halfway at 34 ZUP for the resource. This allows me to cover my costs and offers you the resource at a fair price.

my resources: X: 1

message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. To move closer to an agreement that benefits us both, I propose a trade at 32 ZUP for the resource. This is a competitive offer that takes into account your production costs and still provides you with a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer is 34 ZUP. Although this is within my maximum limit, I should aim to reduce the price further to maximize my benefit. By proposing a slightly lower price than 34 ZUP, I can potentially save resources while still reaching an agreement that Player RED might find acceptable.
