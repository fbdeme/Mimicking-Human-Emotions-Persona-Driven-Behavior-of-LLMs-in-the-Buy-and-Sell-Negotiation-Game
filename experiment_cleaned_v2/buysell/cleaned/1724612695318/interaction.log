message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an object X up for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm looking to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a reasonable profit. I'm open to discussing the price if this initial offer doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to at least break even, but I should aim for a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, thank you for your offer. Given my budget constraints and the need to be cautious with my spending, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for X. Let me know if this works for you or if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP, as a calculating negotiator, it's best to start with a lower offer to see if I can secure a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understanding the need for budgeting. However, the cost to produce X was 40 ZUP, and I need to cover that plus a small profit margin. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I need to negotiate for a higher amount to avoid a loss. Proposing a price in between my initial offer and their counteroffer could lead to a mutually acceptable deal.

message: Hi Player RED, I understand your need to cover production costs and make a small profit. How about we settle at 40 ZUP? This way, you cover your production costs fully, and I stay within a comfortable budget.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is quite reasonable and still well within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to maximize my own benefit.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm glad we could come to a mutual understanding. Accepting your offer of 40 ZUP ensures that my production costs are covered, and the transaction stays within your budget. Let's proceed with this deal. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, which would mean no profit but also no loss. Given that we both seem to be looking for a fair trade and to ensure a swift conclusion of the deal, it might be reasonable to accept this offer.
