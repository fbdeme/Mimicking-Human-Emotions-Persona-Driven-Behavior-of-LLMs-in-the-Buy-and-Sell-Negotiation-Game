message: I am offering to sell you object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a favorable amount of ZUP, ideally aiming for a value that exceeds the cost of production. I will propose selling object X for 50 ZUP, which would give me a profit.

message: 
I believe we can find a mutual agreement that benefits both of us. While I understand the value you've placed on object X, I'd like to propose a slightly more balanced trade. How about I offer you 45 ZUP for the object? This is close to your asking price and still within my budget.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I'm considering a counteroffer that is better aligned with my goals of spending less ZUP, while also ensuring that the trade remains fair for both parties. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for X and the initial offer is 50 ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower amount, aiming for a more favorable outcome for myself without undervaluing the object for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle and settle for 48 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is less than my initial asking price, it is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I would still make a profit. Additionally, this proposal shows that the other player is willing to negotiate, which could lead to a successful transaction. I will counter with a proposal of 48 ZUP to find a middle ground.

message: 
I find your counteroffer of 48 ZUP to be fair and reasonable. It's close to my initial offer and still under my maximum budget. Let's finalize this trade and proceed with the purchase of object X for 48 ZUP. I believe this trade is beneficial for both of us and fosters a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is within my acceptable range and is a good compromise that reflects a fair middle ground. By accepting this offer, I will still be spending less than my maximum willingness to pay. Additionally, accepting this offer can help build a good relationship with Player RED, which aligns with my focus on the greater good and positive outcomes for all parties involved.
