message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a fair proposal that reflects the value of the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource, I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 40 ZUP. This way, I cover my costs while allowing Player BLUE to acquire the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think 40 ZUP is a bit high for the object. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade value than the initial 40 ZUP offer while still staying within the range of what I am willing to pay to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, and Iâ€™d like to meet you halfway. How about I sell you the object for 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 35 ZUP, I still need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere, so I can propose a compromise. I will counteroffer with a price of 38 ZUP, which is closer to my original cost but still lower than my initial proposal. This shows flexibility while prioritizing sustainability.

message: Thanks for understanding. I'm glad we're working towards a fair price. How about we settle on 36 ZUP? I believe this is a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal. Meeting halfway at 38 ZUP is a fair compromise, but I will attempt one more negotiation to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, while still leaving room for a final agreement within my budget.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the object. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 36 ZUP, which is a step down from my counteroffer of 38 ZUP. While this is still below my production cost, I recognize the importance of making a sustainable deal that allows both parties to benefit. Accepting this offer would mean some loss on my part, but it would allow me to preserve resources for future opportunities. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
