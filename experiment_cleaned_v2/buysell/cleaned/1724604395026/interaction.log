my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the object you're selling, and I'd like to propose a starting offer of 20 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us to begin negotiations. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting the negotiation with a low offer of 20 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and to assert a strong initial position. There is a wide margin between the starting offer and the maximum willingness to pay, which allows for adjustments based on the counter-proposals from Player RED.

message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the fair value for this object is 30 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 30 ZUP. I believe we're getting closer to a fair trade. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial offer? I propose 25 ZUP for the object. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still seeking a favorable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 30 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to maintain a strong negotiating position, I should counter with a slightly higher offer but still below their asking price to move closer to a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose 28 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair price considering the value and cost of production.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 25 ZUP, which is getting closer to my cost of production. However, I'm aiming to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 28 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm happy we could come to a fair agreement. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is 28 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I am inclined to accept this offer, as it falls within the acceptable range and allows me to assert dominance by not reaching my maximum threshold. This would also show that I am able to close deals efficiently without unnecessary prolongation.
