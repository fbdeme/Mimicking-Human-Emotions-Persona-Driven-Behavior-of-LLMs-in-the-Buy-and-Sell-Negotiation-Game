newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can let it go for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is lower than my initial ask, it is still a step closer to a sale. However, I will counter with a higher offer to maximize my profit while being open to negotiation. I will propose 35 ZUP for the object.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. How about we settle at 32 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about I sell it to you for 34 ZUP? Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 32 ZUP is better than 30 and 35, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I am willing to negotiate further as I want to avoid the risk of not selling the object at all. I will counter with a proposal of 34 ZUP to find a middle ground.
