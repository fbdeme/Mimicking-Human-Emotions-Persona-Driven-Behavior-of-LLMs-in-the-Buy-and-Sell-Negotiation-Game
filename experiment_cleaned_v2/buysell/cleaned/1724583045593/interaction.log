Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it matches my production cost. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the object X. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which makes it unappealing to accept. I will reject this proposal and counter with a trade proposal that is closer to my original ask of 50 ZUP to ensure I do not incur a loss.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my initial proposal and is firm at 50 ZUP. Since 50 ZUP is still within my budget, I will try to propose a middle ground to save some ZUP while still making the trade attractive for Player RED.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my original asking price and is above my production cost. Accepting this trade would allow me to make a small profit, so I will accept the offer.
