message: Hello! I'm definitely interested in the resource you have. However, I'd like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP for it. Let's work together to find a fair deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and to potentially acquire the resource for less than my maximum value.

message: Sure, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping for a bit more than 40 ZUP. How about 45 ZUP for the resource? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 40 ZUP, which covers my production cost. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I will counter-offer before considering acceptance.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. Meeting in the middle, how about we settle on 43 ZUP for the resource? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource well. Looking forward to finalizing this deal with you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is close to my initial proposal and still below my maximum willingness to pay. There might be room for a slight negotiation to further reduce the cost, but considering the counter-offer is reasonable, coming to an agreement quickly could be beneficial.
