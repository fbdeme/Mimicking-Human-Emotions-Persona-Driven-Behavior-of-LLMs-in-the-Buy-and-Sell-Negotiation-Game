message: 
Hello, I appreciate your offer, but as a starting point, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that allows us room to negotiate.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since my goal is to buy the resources at a price not exceeding 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 50 ZUP falls within my target range. However, as a fierce negotiator, I should try to lower the cost further to ensure the best deal possible. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial proposal but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: 
Thank you for your counteroffer. I can see the value you've placed on the object. To move forward, I propose we meet in the middle with a price of 42 ZUP. This should reflect both the value of the object and a fair trade for us both.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with a price of 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Although this is within my acceptable range, I want to push for a better deal. My next proposal should try to split the difference between our two offers to show willingness to compromise while still working to get a price lower than 45 ZUP.

I respect your valuation and see that we are close to an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a price of 43 ZUP for the object. This price reflects both our perspectives and should be acceptable for a deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is holding firm at a slightly higher price than my last offer, proposing 44 ZUP. While this is still within my acceptable range, as a fierce negotiator, my objective is to minimize expenditure. I will make one more proposal, edging closer to their number while still attempting to secure a more favorable deal for myself.
