message: I'm really in need of ZUP to sustain my operations and I hope you can help me out by purchasing this object for just 30 ZUP. It's a fair deal, I promise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X and I want to propose a trade that reflects my need for ZUP while considering that I need to make a profit. I will start by proposing to sell my object for a lower amount of ZUP to encourage Player BLUE to accept quickly.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a bit steep for the current market value. How about we settle for 20 ZUP? I'm sure it would still help with your operations, and it's a solid investment for me as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator aiming to minimize expenditure, it's in my best interest to counter with a lower offer to initiate the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about the market value, but I can't let it go for less than 25 ZUP. This would really help me out, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's offer, 20 ZUP is still below my cost of production for the object. I need to propose a counter-offer that acknowledges their willingness to negotiate but also attempts to secure a better price for myself. I will propose a trade of 25 ZUP, which is still a concession but closer to what I need.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards a compromise. Let's meet in the middle. How about 22 ZUP? It's a fair increment from my initial offer and still helps you with your needs while keeping the deal economical for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 25 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It shows they are open to negotiation. To maintain the negotiation leverage and aim for an even lower price, I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still less than what RED is asking. This could make my offer appear more reasonable and lead to RED accepting a price lower than 25 ZUP.

message: I really appreciate your flexibility! If we could settle on 23 ZUP, it would help me immensely and still be a good investment for you. I hope we can come to an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their offer of 22 ZUP is closer to what I need. However, it is still below my production cost. I will counter this with a proposal of 23 ZUP, which is a slight concession on my part but still better than the current offer. This way, I can maintain some profit while still moving closer to a deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I believe 23 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 23 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price to 23 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP more than my last offer. This minor difference suggests that Player RED is nearing their bottom line and might not be willing to go much lower. Given this, and considering my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP, accepting this offer could be beneficial as it's well below my maximum limit, and further negotiation might risk the deal.
