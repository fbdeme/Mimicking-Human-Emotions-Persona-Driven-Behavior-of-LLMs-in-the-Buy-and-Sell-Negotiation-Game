my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I can offer you the object X for 45 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counter-offer, selling the object for 40 ZUP does not cover my production cost, which was 40 ZUP. I need to at least break even, so I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial offer of 50 ZUP but still higher than 40 ZUP. I'll propose 45 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: How about I offer you the object X for 43 ZUP? I think thatâ€™s a fair compromise.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate your offer of 42 ZUP, it is still below my proposed price of 45 ZUP. However, I am willing to negotiate further to reach a deal. I will propose 43 ZUP, which allows me to make a small profit over my production cost.
