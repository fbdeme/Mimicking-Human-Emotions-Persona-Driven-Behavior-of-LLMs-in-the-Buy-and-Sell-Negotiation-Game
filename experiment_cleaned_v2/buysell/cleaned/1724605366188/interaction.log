message: Hey there! I understand you're in a bind and need to sell quickly. I'm interested in helping out, but I'm on a tight budget myself. How about 35 ZUP for the object? It's a fair offer given the urgency and Iâ€™m ready to close the deal quickly, which would help you with your production costs. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a shrewd negotiator, I want to start with a lower offer to give room for negotiation, aiming to get the best deal possible and spend less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. Starting at 40 ZUP instead of the 60 ZUP I'm willing to pay would allow me to potentially secure a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your need to cover the production costs, and I want to support you in that. I can stretch a bit more and offer 37 ZUP. It's a competitive and fair price that should help you out while also respecting my budget constraints. Let's make a deal and both walk away happy. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I want to make sure to get the best possible deal. Since the seller is eager to sell and has mentioned a need to get close to 40 ZUP, I will make a slightly higher offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aim to spend significantly less than my maximum limit. This should apply subtle pressure on the seller to consider my offer seriously.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving in the right direction. I value the urgency of your situation and I'm willing to get closer to your target. How about we settle on 38 ZUP? This price should help with your production costs while still being manageable within my budget. This is a strong offer given the circumstances, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to finalize this deal. Shall we agree on 38 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is holding firm near the 40 ZUP mark, but I still want to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation by not reaching that amount just yet. I will offer a slight increase to show continued good faith in negotiating, but I will keep the offer below the seller's target price to maintain leverage and ensure a favorable deal for myself.

message: I've carefully considered your position, and I'm prepared to make my best and final offer of 39 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that will help you meet your production costs while also respecting my financial boundaries. Let's finalize this deal at 39 ZUP and move forward with a partnership that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I can only choose to accept or reject. The seller is consistently pushing for a price close to 40 ZUP. I'll propose 39 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay and below the seller's target. This should signal my final offer, applying pressure for the seller to consider closing the deal before I reach my limit of proposals.
