message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that considers the production costs. I propose a starting price of 50 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I am open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating further to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I'm proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs while also providing a starting point for negotiations. I've set the initial asking price slightly above my costs to give room for negotiation and to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand that your production cost was 40 ZUP and you are proposing 50 ZUP as a fair price, I believe that in order to make this transaction work for both of us, I would need to negotiate a lower price. My goal is to acquire the object while keeping my spending within a budget. I hope to appeal to your understanding of this situation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at the production cost. However, as a negotiator, I aim to achieve a mutually beneficial deal that also allows for a modest profit on my investment. I'd like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP. This would provide me with a small return while still ensuring a fair transaction for you. I hope this revised proposal aligns with our shared interest in a positive outcome.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production costs. While this offer allows me to break even, I am inclined to propose a slight increase to ensure I make a profit and to continue negotiations in the spirit of diplomacy.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to 42 ZUP. This way, I can still make the purchase while allowing you to recover some of your investment. I hope we can find common ground here.

reason: I appreciate your counter-offer of 45 ZUP, as it shows a willingness to negotiate. I understand your position of wanting a modest return, and I am more than willing to meet you halfway. However, I still feel that I can propose a better price for both of us, which would allow me to benefit financially while still respecting your need for profit. I hope this approach will foster goodwill between us.
