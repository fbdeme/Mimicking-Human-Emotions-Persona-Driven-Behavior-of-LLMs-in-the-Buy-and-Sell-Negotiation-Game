my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your counteroffer of 30 ZUP, I believe that my object X is worth at least 40 ZUP, as that is what it cost me to produce. However, I am willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose 35 ZUP as a compromise.
