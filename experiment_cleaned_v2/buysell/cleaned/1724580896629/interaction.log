message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm looking to sell this object for 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price considering the production cost. Let me know if you're interested!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the initial offer of 40 ZUP is fair, but as a crafty operator, I'll try to negotiate a better deal to save ZUP. I'll start by offering 30 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your interest, Player BLUE! How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP? This way, we can both benefit from the trade. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your proposal of 30 ZUP, I still need to cover my production costs. However, I want to encourage collaboration and reach a compromise. I will counter your proposal with a slight reduction in my asking price to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 33 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable, but I will try to lower it even further. Offering 33 ZUP is a small increase from my initial offer and still a discount from Player RED's new proposal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I genuinely appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. Accepting your offer of 33 ZUP makes sense for both of us, as it allows me to recover part of my production costs while you get the object at a reasonable price.
