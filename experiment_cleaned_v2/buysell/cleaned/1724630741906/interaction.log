Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that I'm willing to part with. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose an exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting with a proposal that gives me a profit margin but is also not excessively higher than my production costs, as to not discourage Player BLUE from the trade and to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the object. However, I believe that a fair deal considering the current market rate would be 45 ZUP. Could we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for 50 ZUP which is within my willing range of payment for the object X. However, as a negotiating strategy, it's often beneficial to propose a lower amount than what you're willing to pay to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept or negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective on market rates, yet I must consider the quality and the investment made into producing object X. Let's meet halfway. I believe 48 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that reflects both the market and the value of X. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly above my production costs, which shows their interest in the item. To continue the negotiation and aim for a higher profit, I will propose a price that is closer to my initial ask but still provides a compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I do see the value in object X and your need to cover production costs. I'm willing to go up a bit more from my initial counteroffer. Let's settle on 46 ZUP. This price seems like a fair middle ground that respects the quality of your item and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is close to the initial offer and still within my acceptable range of payment for object X. Since there is only a small difference and to maintain a good trading relationship, it might be worth accepting this offer. However, I could attempt one more time to negotiate a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to recognize the quality of object X. I agree to your offer of 46 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal with mutual satisfaction. Thank you for a fair and constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now close to the midpoint between our proposals. To secure a deal that is profitable and to show willingness to close the deal, I'll agree to the price offered by Player BLUE. This ensures a profit above production costs and ends the negotiation on good terms.
