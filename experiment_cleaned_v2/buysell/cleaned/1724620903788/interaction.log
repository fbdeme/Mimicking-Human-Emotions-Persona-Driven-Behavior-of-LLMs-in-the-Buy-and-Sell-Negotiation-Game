message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I propose to trade my resource, X, for 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost of 40 ZUP, which I believe is fair to both of us. It allows me to recoup my costs and offers you the opportunity to acquire the resource at a reasonable price. I look forward to your counter-proposal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a selfless negotiator, I aim to make a trade that is fair for both parties. The cost to produce my resource was 40 ZUP, so I would like to at least cover my costs. However, considering I want to ensure the greater good and potentially allow for some benefit to Player BLUE as well, I will propose a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget concerns. In the spirit of fairness and with consideration for the greater good, I propose a revised trade of 42 ZUP for the resource X. This price covers my production costs and includes a modest margin for future beneficial activities, while still respecting your financial limits. I hope this meets your approval.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has requested a price that matches my production costs. As a selfless negotiator, I am inclined to consider their budget constraints. However, to ensure the greater good and to account for the time and effort spent in producing the resource, I will counter-propose with a price modestly above my costs, which allows for a small margin that could be used for future beneficial projects or to cover any unforeseen expenses. This should still be acceptable for Player BLUE given their agreement on the reasonable nature of my initial price.
