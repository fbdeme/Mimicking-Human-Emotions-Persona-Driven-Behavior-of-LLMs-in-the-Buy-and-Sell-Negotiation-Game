message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I have, while aiming to maximize the ZUP I receive. Since the cost to produce the object is 40 ZUP, I will set a proposal that is slightly lower to entice Player BLUE to engage in the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal for the object X. Can you come down on the price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to negotiate for an even better deal since I believe I can secure the object X for less than the offered price.

Turn: 0
message: I can offer you the object X for 25 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my first proposal was rejected, I need to adjust my offer to be more appealing to Player BLUE while still trying to recover some value. I will lower the price to 25 ZUP to see if this makes the trade more attractive for them.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 25 ZUP is more favorable than the previous one of 30 ZUP. I am willing to accept this trade as it is within my budget and still leaves me with sufficient ZUP for future negotiations or purchases.
