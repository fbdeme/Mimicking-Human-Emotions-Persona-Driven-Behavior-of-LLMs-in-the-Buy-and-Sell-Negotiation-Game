message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. However, I should start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation and to test the willingness to pay of Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you are offering, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I need to be mindful of my ZUP spending to ensure sustainability. Therefore, I would like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP. Let's work together to find a trade that is fair for both of us and the environment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to begin negotiations by offering a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring that I preserve ZUP for future generations. Starting with an offer of 40 ZUP allows me to potentially reach an agreement closer to the middle of our price ranges.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns regarding sustainability and responsible spending. With that in mind, I propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures a fair profit margin, respecting both our interests. I believe this is a balanced offer that also aligns with sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I aimed to make a profit. Since they've started with a reasonable offer, I’ll propose a compromise that still gives me a profit but also considers their willingness to maintain sustainability. I'll lower my initial asking price but keep it above my production cost to ensure a profitable transaction.

message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate a sustainable and fair trade. In the spirit of reaching a balanced agreement, I propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This offer respects your production costs and profit margin, while also maintaining my commitment to sustainability. I believe this to be a reasonable compromise that serves both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay and appears to be a fair middle ground, taking into account the seller's production costs and profit margin while still maintaining my sustainability goals. However, I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to preserve more ZUP for future use. A counteroffer of 42 ZUP should be close enough to the middle to be considered fair, while still saving resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I value our efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To meet halfway and honor the progress of our negotiation, I propose a slightly adjusted offer of 44 ZUP. This amount provides a modest profit for me and acknowledges your commitment to sustainability. I hope this offer aligns with our shared goal of a fair and equitable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my last proposed price. This is a move towards a middle ground, and I should consider it seriously. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be strategic—proposing a number closer to my last offer but still giving Player BLUE a sense they are getting a better deal. I will propose 44 ZUP, splitting the difference and edging closer to my desired profit margin while remaining open to negotiation.
