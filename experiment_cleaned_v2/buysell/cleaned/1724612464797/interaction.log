message: I see you're interested in acquiring this object. I propose you give me 50 ZUP for it. It's a fair price considering its quality and the cost of production. Let's make this a win-win deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above my costs to see how Player BLUE values the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a fierce negotiator, my goal is to lower my expenditure. I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can secure a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern for getting a good deal. However, considering the production costs and the quality of the object, I believe 45 ZUP is a more balanced offer. Let's meet halfway and close the deal at this rate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 30 ZUP, which is below my cost of production. I need to counter with a higher amount to cover my costs and make a profit. I will split the difference and propose a middle ground which is above my production cost and allows room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a fierce negotiator, I aim to secure the object for an even lower price. I will propose a slight increase from my initial counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. I propose a final price of 42 ZUP. This price covers the production costs and provides a fair and modest profit for the quality you're receiving. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 35 ZUP, which is just below my production cost. Since this is a negotiation, I want to propose a price slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit. I will propose 42 ZUP as a final offer, hoping that the value I've proposed will be seen as a compromise close enough to their last offer but still beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Let's close the deal at 38 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 42 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. Since I have two more proposals left, I will make another attempt to lower the price slightly, while still showing that I am open to negotiation.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your negotiation. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 38 ZUP, which is slightly below my initial production cost. However, considering we are both looking to close the deal and since this offer is very close to my production cost, accepting this proposal would allow me to sell the object without incurring a loss. This is my fourth and final proposal, so it's better to close the deal now rather than risk ending with no sale at all.
