message: Oh dear, I'm in quite the predicament! I absolutely need this resource to keep my operations going, but my funds are so tight. I can only offer 30 ZUP for it. It's all I can manage without putting myself in jeopardy. Can we work something out, please?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm making a lower initial offer to leave room for negotiation, given that I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but would prefer to pay less to conserve resources. By pleading for a lower price, I'm hoping to appeal to the seller's sympathy and secure a better deal.

message: I understand your situation, but I really need to stick to my production cost. Is there any way you could manage to come closer to the asking price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is in a tough spot financially, and I can empathize with that. However, I need to cover my production cost, so I can't go lower than 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I completely understand the need to cover costs, and I wish I could meet your full asking price. Times are tough, and every ZUP is precious to me. Could you consider 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to push a little bit because I really need this resource. Your help would mean the world to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I've proposed 30 ZUP initially, and the other player is asking for more without specifying an amount. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim to spend far less than my maximum willingness to pay. My strategy is to convey a sense of urgency and neediness to encourage the seller to lower their expectations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my tough situation. I've been crunching the numbers here, and while it's going to be really challenging, I can push my offer to 40 ZUP. It's honestly more than I should be spending, but I'm hoping we can make this work. I'm relying on your kindness in this difficult time.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has acknowledged my offer but is still seeking a higher amount. I will continue to increment my offer conservatively, still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to slowly move towards a middle ground while maintaining the narrative of financial constraint to encourage concessions from the seller.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I've been going over my finances repeatedly, and I'm genuinely stretching myself thin here. But because I value this resource so much and I want to respect your production costs, I'm willing to make a final offer of 50 ZUP. I sincerely hope this can meet your needs and we can close this deal. Your understanding in this negotiation has been so appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I have to decide to accept or reject an offer outright. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will make a final offer that is closer to my limit but still below it, hoping that the seller is now more inclined to accept. My narrative of financial hardship remains consistent, aiming to gain sympathy and a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: While I truly appreciate your position and the efforts we've both made to find common ground, I'm afraid I simply cannot exceed my financial capabilities. It seems we won't be able to reach an agreement this time around. Thank you for your understanding, and I wish you the best in finding a buyer who can meet your asking price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player RED is not willing to accept an offer below their asking price, and since I have reached my proposal limit, I must now decide to accept their terms or reject the deal. Considering the seller's firm stance and my need to adhere to my financial constraints, I choose to reject the offer and end the negotiation.
