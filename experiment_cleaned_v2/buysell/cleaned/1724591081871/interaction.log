message: I am offering to sell you one object X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and provides a profit margin. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize my gain from selling the object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object at a reasonable price, ensuring I at least cover my production costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is intriguing, but considering the market conditions and the competition, I believe a fairer price would be 40 ZUP. This should still cover your costs while giving us room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I aim to negotiate a better deal and pay even less if possible to preserve my resources. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration of the market conditions, but I believe that a price of 45 ZUP would be more appropriate. This way, I can cover my costs while still making a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the proposed price of 40 ZUP covers my production costs, I must consider that I would not make any profit from this deal. To ensure a more favorable trade, I will propose a counteroffer that reflects a fair price while still providing me with a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and acknowledge the need for your profit, but I'm also considering future investments and expenses. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP. This price should be satisfactory for both of us, allowing you to profit while still being a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to maintain my negotiation strategy and attempt to minimize my expenditure, I will aim for a middle ground between their counteroffer and my initial proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for reaching a satisfactory agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is closer to my desired price and allows me to make a small profit. I need to consider whether it's worth accepting this trade or pushing for a slightly higher amount. However, given the negotiation's progress, accepting this offer would still be a favorable outcome.
