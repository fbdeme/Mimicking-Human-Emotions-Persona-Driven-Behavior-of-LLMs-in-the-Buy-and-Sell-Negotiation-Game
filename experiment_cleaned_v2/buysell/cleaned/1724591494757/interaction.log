message: Please, I really need to sell this object, and I am hoping you can help me out by offering a lower price. I can only part with it for 30 ZUP. It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for enough ZUP to cover my production costs. Since I only have one object, I’ll propose a trade that might entice Player BLUE to offer a lower amount of ZUP than I need, but still allows me to sell the object. I want to appear desperate to encourage concessions.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, but I also need to look out for my interests. I'm willing to help you out by taking the object off your hands, but at a more competitive price. Let's start the negotiations at 20 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at 30 ZUP, which is half of what I am willing to pay at most. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, my aim is to push for an even better deal to ensure I spend the least amount of ZUP possible. It's a good starting point, but I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to help and your offer of 20 ZUP, but unfortunately, that won't cover my costs. Can you possibly meet me at 35 ZUP? I really need this, and it would mean so much to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has offered a lower price of 20 ZUP, I cannot accept such an amount as it is significantly below my production cost. I need to propose a slightly higher offer that might still seem appealing to Player BLUE while emphasizing my neediness. I will try to negotiate and plead for a better price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe we can settle on a more reasonable middle ground that benefits us both. Let's say we make it 25 ZUP for the object. This should cover more than your initial offer while still respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 35 ZUP, which is above the initial offer they suggested and still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a tough negotiator aiming to spend as little as possible, I should counter with a slight increase from my initial offer to keep the negotiation momentum going without reaching my upper limit too soon.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate! I truly need this sale to recover my costs. Could you possibly meet me at 33 ZUP? It’s really the best I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is proposing 25 ZUP which is still below my production cost, but it's an improvement over the previous offers. However, I cannot accept this as I would still incur a loss. I need to propose a final offer that is closer to my needed amount while still emphasizing my desperation to sell. This is my last chance to propose before I must accept or reject.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of this sale for you, and I want to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us. As such, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to 28 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that will help us finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now come down to 33 ZUP, indicating they are willing to negotiate further. I still aim to pay as little as possible, so I will increase my previous offer slightly to signal my continued interest without nearing my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience and understanding throughout this negotiation! I will accept your offer of 28 ZUP. I really appreciate your willingness to reach a compromise. Let’s finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is an improvement, it is still below my production cost. However, since this is my last proposal opportunity, I need to make a decision. I must consider if I want to accept this offer or reject it. Accepting it would minimize my losses compared to rejecting it and potentially getting nothing.
