message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object of great value that I'm willing to part with for the right price. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm willing to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let's make a deal that benefits both sides. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit. I'll propose 50 ZUP which gives me a margin above the production cost and can be seen as a starting point for the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a fair price for the object would be 45 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP is within my budget since I’m willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price, as the object only cost Player RED 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a lower offer of 45 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I believe that our object is worth a bit more, given its cost of production and its value. Let's meet in the middle and settle for 47 ZUP. This way, we both walk away from this deal with satisfaction. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come in with a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price. While I'm aiming to make a profit, I want to encourage further negotiation without dropping too close to my production cost. I'll counter with a price that meets halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but how about we settle at 46 ZUP instead? It’s a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now offering to settle at 47 ZUP, which is still below the maximum I’m willing to pay. However, I think I can push a bit further to negotiate a better price. I will propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to lower the price slightly.

message: I think your offer of 46 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal at that price. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a small concession to 46 ZUP, which is quite close to my previous proposal. This new offer is still above my production cost, and while I could try to push for more, it might be more advantageous to secure the deal and ensure a profit. A 6 ZUP profit is reasonable, and further negotiation might become counterproductive.
