message: I am offering my object for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object for a reasonable amount of ZUP, while also testing the waters for BLUE's willingness to pay. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I’ll propose a trade for a lower amount to see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am willing to offer 15 ZUP for the object. Would you consider this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 20 ZUP is reasonable and well below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve my resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 15 ZUP, but I'm looking for something a bit higher. How about 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer of 15 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, I still need to evaluate if it's worth accepting. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I cannot accept the 15 ZUP offer. Instead, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if BLUE might be willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. How about we settle at 20 ZUP for the object? I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I will try to negotiate a slightly lower price to save even more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but I'm looking for a little more. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is better than the initial amount I received, but it is still below my break-even point of 40 ZUP. However, since it's closer to what I need, I will counter-offer again to see if I can push for a more favorable deal while still keeping the negotiation open.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. Can we agree on 25 ZUP for the object? I believe this would be a fair and mutually beneficial arrangement.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new counteroffer of 30 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try to negotiate a slightly better deal to conserve resources.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is still below my break-even point but is the best offer I've received so far. Since I've reached the maximum number of proposals, I need to consider if I want to accept this offer or reject it entirely. Given the circumstances, I will choose to accept the trade since it’s better than nothing.
