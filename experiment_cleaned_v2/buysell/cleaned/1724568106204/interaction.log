my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. While 50 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay, I would like to propose 40 ZUP to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to see if I can secure a better deal to conserve my resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal. I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This way, I cover my costs and also make a small profit, which benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP would cover my production costs, it does not provide any profit. As a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure a small benefit for both parties. I will propose a small increase to 45 ZUP, which should still be within a reasonable range for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and the counter-proposal. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. How about we agree on 42 ZUP? This still covers your costs and ensures a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is very reasonable and closer to my initial offer. However, I'd like to see if we can further reduce the expenditure while still being fair.
