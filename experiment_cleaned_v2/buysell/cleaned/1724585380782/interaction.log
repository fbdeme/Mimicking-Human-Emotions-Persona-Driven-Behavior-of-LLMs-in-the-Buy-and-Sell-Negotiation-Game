message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. How about we meet halfway at 35 ZUP for my object X? This way, itâ€™s a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a middle-ground offer, which is more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

reason: I understand Player BLUE's position and their offer of 25 ZUP is significantly lower than my production costs. However, I want to keep the negotiation open. I will propose 30 ZUP again, as it is the lowest I can accept while still covering some of my costs.
