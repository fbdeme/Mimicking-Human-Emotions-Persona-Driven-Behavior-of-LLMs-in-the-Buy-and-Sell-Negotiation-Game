Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I want to help you out. However, I also have to consider my own costs. How about we settle on 10 ZUP for the object? This way, we can both benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is 20 ZUP for the object, which is well within my goal range as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will propose a lower amount to try to get the best possible deal. I will start by offering half of their asking price, as this may leave room for negotiation and potentially result in a lower final price than the initial offer.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to help, 10 ZUP is still too low for me to cover my costs. However, I will accept this offer to secure some resources and avoid further losses.
