message: I understand we're both looking to make a fair trade. I've proposed a price that covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin. I'm open to your counter-offer and willing to work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and potentially make a profit, while also leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above my production costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a trade that makes sense for both of us. I propose 40 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my aim is to spend as little as possible while securing the resources. Player RED has not disclosed their costs, so opening with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad we're working together on this. To make the trade a bit more equitable for both sides, I've adjusted the price to 45 ZUP. This would provide me with a modest profit while still being a fair purchase price for you. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer matches my production costs. While this would not afford me any profit, I understand the importance of compromise to facilitate a deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount to aim for a minimal profit, which should still be attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm willing to come up a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet almost in the middle? I propose 42 ZUP for the resource. It's a competitive price that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I should aim to get a better deal. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer yet still below their counter-offer, I create a perception of compromise and inch closer to a favorable outcome.
