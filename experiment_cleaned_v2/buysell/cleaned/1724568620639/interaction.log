newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 80 ZUP is too high for me. I can offer 40 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 80 ZUP for the resource is above my maximum willingness to pay. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 40 ZUP is too low for me. How about 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is exactly the cost of production, which leaves no profit margin. As a calculating negotiator, I will counter with a slightly higher price to ensure a small profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, to see if I can negotiate a better deal, I will make a slightly lower offer.
