my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation and am willing to help. I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals, as it is half of what I am willing to pay at most. Considering I prioritize sustainability and aim to minimize ZUP spending, accepting this offer would align with my objectives. It also seems like a fair price, considering the urgency expressed by Player RED.
