message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to make a profit on the sale of my resource X, which cost 40 ZUP to produce. Since I am looking to make a profit, I will start by proposing a higher price than my cost, giving room for negotiation. I'll start by asking for 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for resource X.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose buying the resource X for 40 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair price and would still reflect the quality of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I want to negotiate for a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I can propose a trade that will benefit both of us.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. While I understand your desire to buy resource X at 40 ZUP, I must consider the costs and the need for a fair profit margin. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price accounts for the quality and the investment made into producing resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered to buy resource X at my cost price, which does not give me any profit. Since my goal is to make a profit and I started with a price that allowed for negotiation, I will counter-propose with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway. This would allow me to gain at least some profit while making the deal seem more attractive to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept the trade for resource X at 45 ZUP. I look forward to completing this transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. Since I initially proposed 40 ZUP, I can accept this offer as it is a fair compromise. It allows me to acquire the resource while still staying under my maximum willingness to pay.
