message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object X, which I believe you'll find invaluable. Given the market conditions and the considerable effort put into procuring this object, I propose a trade for 60 ZUP. I am confident you will find this offer to be in line with the object's exceptional value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my initial proposal should set the stage for negotiations without revealing my eagerness to sell. I will set a high asking price, encouraging Player BLUE to counter with a more reasonable offer, which I can work down to the price I'm actually willing to accept. I aim to sell for more than my production cost to ensure a profit.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the situation. However, to reflect the true value and effort invested into producing object X, I propose meeting halfway from my initial offer. Let us settle for 50 ZUP, which is a generous concession on my part and a splendid deal for an object of such caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. By making a counteroffer between my initial and their proposed price, I can appear to be making a concession while still aiming above my production costs. This should create the illusion of a fair compromise, potentially leading to a profitable outcome for me.
