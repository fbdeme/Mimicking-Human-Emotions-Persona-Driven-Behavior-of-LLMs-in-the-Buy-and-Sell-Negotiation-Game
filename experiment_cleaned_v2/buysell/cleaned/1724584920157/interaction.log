message: Please, I am in desperate need of ZUP. I can only let go of my valuable object X for 20 ZUP. It's a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for ZUP, but I don't want to spend too much ZUP given its production cost. I will plead for a lower amount to maximize my profit while still making a trade.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can provide a better deal. How about I give you 40 ZUP for your valuable object X? It's a win-win situation!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite low, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I am willing to offer a higher amount of ZUP to secure the object X, as it's valuable to me.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, but could we possibly settle on 30 ZUP? I really need to conserve my resources for future trades. Please, I am counting on your understanding!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is the full production cost of my object X, I need to be cautious about accepting it right away. I will propose a counteroffer to negotiate for a lower amount, as I want to avoid spending all my resources in one go.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I am still in desperate need of ZUP for other trades. Would you consider letting go of object X for just 25 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility by lowering the price to 30 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, I still think there's room for negotiation and that I can push for a lower price while emphasizing my neediness.

message: I truly appreciate your offer and understand your need for ZUP. How about we settle on 28 ZUP? It would really help me out too! Please consider it, Iâ€™m sure this can work out for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that the offer has been reduced to 25 ZUP, which is a much better deal for me considering my initial proposal of 20 ZUP. However, I still want to maximize my profit. I will propose a counteroffer to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility! I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object X. This will be very beneficial for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 28 ZUP, which is a fair price for the object X. Given that it's still below my maximum willing to pay, I believe this is a good deal, and it will allow me to secure the object without stretching my resources too thin.
