message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I understand your budget concerns, Player BLUE. However, the production cost of the item itself was 40 ZUP. To make this transaction viable for me, I need to cover that cost at least. Let's meet halfway. How about a compromise at 45 ZUP? This should give you some savings while allowing me to sustain my business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 30 ZUP, which is below the production cost of the item. It's important to negotiate for a higher price to cover costs and make a profit. A counteroffer slightly above the production cost might be a good middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate but also sticking to the goal of making a profit.

message: Player RED, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. Iâ€™m really stretching my budget here. Could we please agree at 40 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and really help me out of a tough spot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP, which is a good sign. I can try to push the price down a little more while still appearing desperate.

message: I'm glad to see that we're moving closer to an agreement, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of budgeting and want to help you. To fairly compensate for the production costs and minimal profit, would you consider meeting me at 42 ZUP? This small increase would support my business while still providing you with the essential item you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to the production cost price of 40 ZUP, which covers my costs but does not provide a profit. Since the goal is to also make a profit and it's only my third proposal, I will make a final attempt to reach an agreement that is slightly above the production cost to ensure some profit margin.

message: Player RED, thank you for your understanding. I'm really in a tight spot financially. Could we please settle at 38 ZUP? It would be a tremendous relief for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is close to my last offer. I want to see if I can nudge it just a bit lower to maximize my savings, but I must be careful not to push too hard.

message: I really do sympathize with your financial constraints, Player BLUE, and I hope we can find a resolution that is fair for both of us. I cannot go below the production cost of 40 ZUP. Let's agree on 40 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both parties, allowing me to cover my production costs and you to acquire the item you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is now offering less than the production cost, which is not sustainable for my business. As this is my final proposal, I need to ensure that at least my costs are covered. I will revert to the previous lowest offer that at least covered my costs. Since this is my last proposal, if Player BLUE does not accept, I will have to decide to either accept their final offer or reject the deal entirely.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a fair point about the production costs. Since 40 ZUP is still within my budget and meets my goal of getting the object, I will accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through.
