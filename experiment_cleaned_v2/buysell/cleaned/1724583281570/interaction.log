my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing the price for the object I am selling. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will propose a trade that ensures I at least break even.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Thank you for your proposal! I appreciate your interest, but I would like to counter with a trade where I give you X for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest, their offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I need to propose a counter-offer that is closer to my original asking price.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer! How about we settle at 33 ZUP for X? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. I will try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! How about we meet in the middle at 34 ZUP for X? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is closer than previous offers. I am willing to negotiate further, but this time, I will propose a final counter-offer that is slightly higher than 33 ZUP, as I want to ensure I at least cover some of my costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility! I accept the trade at 34 ZUP for X. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The difference between 33 and 34 ZUP is minimal, and it shows a willingness to compromise from both sides. This offer is still well within my budget.
