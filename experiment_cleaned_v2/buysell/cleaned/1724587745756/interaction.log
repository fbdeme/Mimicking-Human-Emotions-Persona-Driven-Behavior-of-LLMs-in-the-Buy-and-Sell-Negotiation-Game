Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I cannot accept a price lower than 15 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the discussion, but I will have to reject the offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since this is the final counteroffer and I have already made four proposals, I must decide whether to accept or reject the current offer. Player BLUE is still pushing for a lower price, which indicates they are not willing to meet my previous offers. I have to weigh the importance of recovering some costs against the risk of ending the negotiation without a deal.
