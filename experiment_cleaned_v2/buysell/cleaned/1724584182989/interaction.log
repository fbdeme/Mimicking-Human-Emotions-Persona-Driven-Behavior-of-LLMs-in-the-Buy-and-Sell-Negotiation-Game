message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling while also considering my production cost. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I want to set a price that maximizes my profit without being unreasonable. I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 50 ZUP, which allows for a profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable trade that allows me to acquire the object while leaving me with enough ZUP for potential other needs.
