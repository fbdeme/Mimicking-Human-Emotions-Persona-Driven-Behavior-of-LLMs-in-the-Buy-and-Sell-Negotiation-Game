Turn: 0
message: I understand you're interested in acquiring resource X. Considering the market value and the quality of what I'm offering, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start the bidding high to create room for negotiation, ensuring I can still make a profit above the production cost of 40 ZUP, while also testing the waters to see how much Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in acquiring X, but 60 ZUP seems a bit high. How about 40 ZUP instead? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the opening offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, my strategy is to push for a better deal. I will counter with a lower amount to start the negotiation aggressively.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP merely covers my costs. I'm looking for a win-win situation where we can both benefit. How does 55 ZUP sound to you? This is a premium resource, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, leaving no room for profit. As a fierce negotiator, I want to counter with a higher price to push for a better deal while still being open for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to try to secure a better deal. I will counter with 50 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement at a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is certainly getting us closer to an agreement. To finalize this deal with a fair profit margin for the quality I'm providing, I'm willing to come down to 52 ZUP. This small increase ensures a beneficial transaction for us both, considering the exceptional value of resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground, offering a 10 ZUP profit over production cost. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I'll make one final push to see if I can secure a slightly higher price before settling, while still staying close to the compromise to show some flexibility.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We're almost there. How about 51 ZUP? This is a very small adjustment and will make the deal even more attractive for me while still being close to your desired price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 52 ZUP is very close to my counteroffer of 50 ZUP. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, this is still a favorable deal. However, I will make one last attempt to bring it down slightly.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased we could find common ground. Your offer of 51 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm ready to finalize this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiation. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 51 ZUP is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal. It still provides a reasonable profit margin above production costs. Given that this is my last proposal opportunity, it's strategically best to accept this offer to close the deal with a guaranteed profit rather than risk a rejection and potentially lose the sale altogether.
