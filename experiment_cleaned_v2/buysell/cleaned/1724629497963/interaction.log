message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality object X ready for sale. Given its production costs and its value, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X for 60 ZUP. Looking forward to your response and a fruitful negotiation!
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to sell my object X and recover at least the production cost, I'm going to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade that asks for more than my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds, and to determine their willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the object X you're providing. I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade where you give X: 1 and in return, I give ZUP: 55. This takes into account both the production costs and value you mentioned, while also considering the spirit of negotiation and future cooperation between us. I believe this trade could be mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to secure the resources at a fair price but also maintain goodwill for future dealings. Player RED's initial offer is at my maximum willingness to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's slightly lower, aiming for a middle ground where we both feel the value of the trade. This approach will also demonstrate my interest in a fair negotiation without simply accepting the first offer.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm pleased to see your willingness to negotiate. I understand your proposed price of 55 ZUP, but considering the quality and value of object X, I propose a trade where I give you X for 58 ZUP. This amount ensures that I can cover my production costs while also providing you with a fair deal for the value you're receiving. I believe this revised proposal is in the spirit of our negotiation and is a step towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE is interested in the object and willing to negotiate. They've come close to my initial asking price, which is a good sign. However, I want to maximize my profit while also making a sale, so I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but still lower than my initial proposal. This should convey my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher return on my investment.
