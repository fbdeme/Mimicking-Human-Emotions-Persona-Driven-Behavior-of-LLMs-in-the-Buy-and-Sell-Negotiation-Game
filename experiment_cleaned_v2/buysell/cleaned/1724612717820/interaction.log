message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I still need to cover my production costs, so I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for exactly what it cost me to produce it, which is 40 ZUP. This ensures I am not at a loss, and you receive the unit you need. Can we agree on this?
