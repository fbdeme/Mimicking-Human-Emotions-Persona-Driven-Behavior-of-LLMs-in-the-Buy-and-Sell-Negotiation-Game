message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP. Let's make a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object for a reasonable ZUP amount, which will allow me to recover my production cost while giving Player BLUE a chance to make a fair trade. I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.

message: Thank you for your offer. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable. However, I want to test if I can get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about I sell the object for 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this trade as it would result in a loss for me. Instead, I will counter with a slightly lower offer of 35 ZUP. This gives Player BLUE a better deal than my original offer while still getting closer to recovering my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 40 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I can save 5 ZUP by accepting this deal, but I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can save even more.

message: Thank you for your offer. How about we settle at 34 ZUP for the object? I believe it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Although it is better than 30 ZUP and 33 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, I still need to recover my costs. However, it is closer to my goal than previous offers, so I will propose a final counteroffer of 34 ZUP, which is a small concession. I hope Player BLUE will accept this to close the deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 34 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP more than my last offer and still quite reasonable. This is a good compromise, and I should accept it to ensure the deal goes through.
