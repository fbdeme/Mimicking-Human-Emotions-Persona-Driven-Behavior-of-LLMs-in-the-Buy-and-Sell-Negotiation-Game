message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you this valuable resource. Considering the production costs and its inherent value, I believe my asking price is fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recuperate at least my production costs, but I should start with an initial higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in acquiring the resource, but I was thinking of a slightly lower investment to make it work for my budget. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as a strategic move, I'll attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range that Player RED might consider.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet halfway and to ensure a good deal for both of us, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP for the resource. This should cover the production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I should counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a middle ground that is still profitable for me.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my offer, Player RED. I believe we're close to an agreement. To further meet in the middle, how about we settle on 46 ZUP for the resource? I think this price fairly reflects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer is closer to my initial counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I can propose a new amount that is still below the current asking price but also reflects my intention to reach a fair agreement. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is above my initial offer and might be seen as a compromise.
