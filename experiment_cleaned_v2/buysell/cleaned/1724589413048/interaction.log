message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, considering the current market conditions and the value I perceive from the object, I propose a trade of 35 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a competitive offer that benefits us both. Let's find a middle ground that works for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as an ambitious negotiator, my goal is to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. Therefore, I will propose a lower price to start the negotiation, aiming to save resources while still obtaining the object.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective, and I would like to propose a compromise. How about I sell you the object for 38 ZUP? This way, we can both feel good about the trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP, it doesn't cover my costs of 40 ZUP. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and finding a compromise. I will counter-propose a trade of 38 ZUP, which is slightly less than my original asking price but still closer to covering my expenses. This way, I am being considerate of Player BLUEâ€™s perspective while still aiming to meet my financial needs.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. I see that we are getting closer to a fair agreement. To keep the negotiation moving forward and in the spirit of compromise, I propose we meet a bit closer to my last offer. I'm willing to buy the object for 36 ZUP. I believe this is a mutually beneficial price point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range, but I aim to push for a better deal. As a strategic negotiator, I want to assert my position and try to lower the cost further without risking the deal. I will counter with an offer closer to my original proposal but still higher to show my willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your continued willingness to find common ground, Player BLUE. I appreciate your offer of 36 ZUP. How about we settle on a price of 37 ZUP for the object? I think this could work well for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and offer 36 ZUP. While it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I recognize the importance of reaching an agreement and maintaining a positive relationship. I will counter this offer by proposing 37 ZUP, which is a small concession on my part but still helps me move closer to covering my costs. This way, I am showing flexibility while also advocating for my own needs.

message: Player RED, I think we've reached a good compromise at 37 ZUP. I am happy to accept this offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future interactions. Let's finalize this deal at 37 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is a minor increase from my last proposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Although I want to assert dominance in this negotiation, it is also important to secure the deal at a reasonable price. By accepting this offer, I maintain a strong negotiating position for future deals, showing that I am firm yet reasonable. Accepting this offer also ensures I close the deal efficiently without protracting the negotiation unnecessarily.
