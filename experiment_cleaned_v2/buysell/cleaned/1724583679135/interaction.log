message: I am selling one object X for 50 ZUP. Let’s make this trade happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my gain on the sale of the object X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start with an aggressive offer. I will propose to sell the object X for 50 ZUP, giving me a profit margin while still being competitive.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object X, but how about I offer you 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to test if RED is willing to lower the price further to assert my negotiating position. I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP for the object instead.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can’t accept 40 ZUP for object X, but how about I sell it to you for 45 ZUP instead? It’s a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate a better price. I will counter with a more favorable offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This way, I can at least break even and potentially gain a small profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I accept the deal for 45 ZUP. Let's make it happen!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter proposal from RED for 45 ZUP is better than my last offer of 40 ZUP, and still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of acquiring the object X at a reasonable price.
