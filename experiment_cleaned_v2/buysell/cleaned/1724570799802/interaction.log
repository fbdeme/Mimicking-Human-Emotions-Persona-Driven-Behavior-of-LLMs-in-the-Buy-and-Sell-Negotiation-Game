message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a small margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover the cost, but I also want to ensure a fair trade for Player BLUE. A reasonable starting point might be 50 ZUP to allow for some negotiation room.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about I buy the object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my remaining resources. I will propose to buy the object for 40 ZUP instead, which gives me a better deal while still being a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, I can cover my costs and have a small margin for sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my cost, it leaves no margin for profit or unforeseen expenses. Since I'm focused on the greater good, I should aim for a slightly higher amount to ensure sustainability.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. However, would you be willing to sell the object for 43 ZUP instead? That would help me manage my resources better.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my proposal with a price of 45 ZUP, which is acceptable as it is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I still want to push for a better deal. I will propose 43 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to sell the object for 43 ZUP. This should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that 43 ZUP is close to my last offer and still provides a small margin above my production cost, it seems reasonable and aligns with my goal of being selfless and fair.
