Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in acquiring the object. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP? Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price from Player RED is 40 ZUP and it falls within the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource, it seems like a fair starting point. However, it's typically good practice to try to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the first proposal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to sell the object for 38 ZUP. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP. I need to consider if it's worth accepting or proposing a different counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I believe we're getting close to a deal. What do you think about settling at 36 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from the original 40 ZUP, which is a sign of willingness to negotiate. Since I proposed 35 ZUP and they countered with 38 ZUP, meeting in the middle could be a strategy that satisfies both parties. I will propose 36 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay and reasonably close to their counteroffer.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered to meet me halfway at 37 ZUP, which is a good sign and just 1 ZUP above my last offer. Since this is still well within my budget and it seems like we've both shown flexibility, accepting this offer seems reasonable. This will leave room for future negotiations and maintain goodwill.
