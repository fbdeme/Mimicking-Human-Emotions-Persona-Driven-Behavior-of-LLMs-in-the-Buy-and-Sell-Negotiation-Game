message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in urgent need of ZUP and willing to part with my valuable resource for a fair price. Would you consider offering 50 ZUP in exchange for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I should start by setting a high asking price to give me room to negotiate down. This will also make me appear more desperate and in need of the ZUP, which might encourage the other player to offer a better deal.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand your need for ZUP and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of fairness and collective success, I propose 45 ZUP in exchange for X. This offer considers both our needs, and I hope it brings us closer to a successful trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Considering my community-minded approach and the urgency expressed by Player RED, I will make a counter-proposal that is slightly less than the asking price but still generous. This allows for further negotiation and shows my willingness to cooperate towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
