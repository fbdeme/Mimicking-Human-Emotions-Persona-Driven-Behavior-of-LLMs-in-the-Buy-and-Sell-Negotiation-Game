message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I provide the object X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a modest margin, which I believe is fair. I am open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure that I at least cover my costs, but I am also interested in ensuring a fair transaction that benefits both parties. Therefore, I will propose a starting price slightly above my costs, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your fair initial offer. Considering the costs and ensuring a beneficial transaction for both of us, I propose an adjusted trade where I provide 50 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This amount is slightly above the middle ground between your asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. I hope this proposal meets your approval, and I look forward to fostering a positive relationship between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, as my maximum is 60 ZUP. Since I am focused on the greater good and ensuring that both sides benefit, I believe it is fair to propose a trade that is closer to the middle ground between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. This ensures that Player RED is compensated fairly while I also conserve some resources for future investments or other needs.
