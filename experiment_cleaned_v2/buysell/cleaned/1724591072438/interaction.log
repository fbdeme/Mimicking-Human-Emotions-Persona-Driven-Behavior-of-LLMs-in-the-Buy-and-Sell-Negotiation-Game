message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that will allow me to sell the object while maximizing my profit. I want to ensure I get a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market conditions and the availability of similar resources, I would be more comfortable with a deal for 45 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources and Player RED has offered it for 50 ZUP, it seems like a fair trade. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to get the price even lower to conserve my resources. I'll propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down.

message: I accept your offer for 1 object X for 45 ZUP. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my original proposal, it is still above my production cost. Accepting this deal would allow me to profit while also closing the trade quickly.
