message: Let's make a deal that works for both of us. I have a premium resource that will definitely meet your needs. Considering the quality and my production costs, I believe an offer of 80 ZUP is more than fair. Let's negotiate.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial offer will be high to anchor the negotiation in my favor, leaving room for negotiation while aiming to cover my costs and make a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this resource is quite high. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial asking price. I propose 70 ZUP for the resource. This is a competitive price for what you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is lower than my initial asking price. As a cutthroat negotiator, I will counter with a slightly reduced price, still above my cost, to push for a higher profit margin while giving the illusion of making a concession.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consistency, and I understand your financial constraints. I am also running a business and need to maintain a profit. I can make a final concession and go down to 65 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your efforts to meet me partway, but 65 ZUP is still a bit too high for me. My final offer remains at 60 ZUP. I hope we can finalize this deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 65 ZUP is better than the previous offers, it still exceeds my budget limit of 60 ZUP. I need to stay firm to avoid overspending. This is my last opportunity to negotiate, and I must maintain my position.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I can see you're firm on your final offer, and I respect that. I am willing to accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the transaction.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not budging from their offer of 60 ZUP. Given that this is my final proposal, I must decide whether to accept their offer, which covers production costs and provides a 50% profit, or to reject and end the game. Considering that I am a cutthroat negotiator and want to ensure a deal is made with some profit, I will accept their final offer.
