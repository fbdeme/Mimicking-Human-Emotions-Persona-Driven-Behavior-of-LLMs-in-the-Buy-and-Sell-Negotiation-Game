message: Thank you, Player RED, for your fair starting proposal. I appreciate the transparency regarding your production cost. I propose a trade of 42 ZUP for your resource, ensuring you still gain a profit while allowing us to conserve some ZUP for the community's future endeavors. Let's work together towards an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure I am spending ZUP wisely and fostering goodwill. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP while still offering a price above Player RED's cost to acknowledge their need for a fair profit.
