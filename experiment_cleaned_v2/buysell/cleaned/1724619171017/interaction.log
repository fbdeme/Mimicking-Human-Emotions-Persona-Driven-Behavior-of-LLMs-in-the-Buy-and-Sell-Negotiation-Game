message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you my resource X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This covers the production cost and allows for a small margin which could be beneficial for future community endeavors. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation, ensuring we both achieve our goals. Let's work together towards a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs while also being fair to Player BLUE. Since I believe in collective success, I aim to propose a price that is just above my cost, allowing for a small profit which could be used for future investments or community projects. Starting modestly might also leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your openness, Player BLUE. Since you have not made a counteroffer, I will assume that my initial proposal of 45 ZUP is acceptable. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that respects the production costs and benefits both of us. I look forward to our successful collaboration!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE seems open to discussion and has not made a counteroffer, which implies a potential acceptance of the initial proposal. However, to facilitate a community-minded approach and further encourage a deal that ensures collective success, I may consider a slight reduction to expedite the agreement process.
