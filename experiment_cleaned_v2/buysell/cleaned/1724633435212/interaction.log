message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I understand your budget constraints, however, to fairly compensate for the production costs and the quality of resource X, I'd like to meet halfway and propose a trade for 47 ZUP. This should be a beneficial agreement for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
