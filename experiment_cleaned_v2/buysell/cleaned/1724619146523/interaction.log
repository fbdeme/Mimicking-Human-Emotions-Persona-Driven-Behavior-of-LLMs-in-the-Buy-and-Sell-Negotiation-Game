message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This would cover my costs and provide a small margin, but I'm open to a fair negotiation that benefits us both. Let's work together to make a deal that we're both happy with!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even. However, since I'm community-minded, I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a win-win situation.

So, I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal, but still above the production cost to ensure a fair margin.
