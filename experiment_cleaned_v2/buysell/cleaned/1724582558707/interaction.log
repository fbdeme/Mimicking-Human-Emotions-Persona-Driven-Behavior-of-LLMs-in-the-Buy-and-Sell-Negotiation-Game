message: I am offering you my object X for 100 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) to sell, I will propose a trade that maximizes my profit while also testing Player BLUE's willingness to pay. I will ask for a considerable amount of ZUP to start the negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. Would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is too high as I am only willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources. I need to propose a lower amount to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but how about I sell you the object for 60 ZUP instead? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer of 40 ZUP matches the production cost of the object X, which means I would break even. I want to negotiate further, so I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP for the object is acceptable to me. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is within my budget and aligns with my maximum willingness to pay. This is a fair deal and meets my goals.
