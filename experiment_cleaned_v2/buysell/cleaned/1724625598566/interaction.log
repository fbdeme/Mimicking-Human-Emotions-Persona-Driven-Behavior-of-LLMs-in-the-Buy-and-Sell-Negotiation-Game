message: I have an object X available for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. Let's start the bidding at 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counteroffers if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade offer that gives me a profit over the production cost, but I'm also willing to negotiate, so I won't start with too high of an asking price. I'll propose selling my object for 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit of 10 ZUP. This leaves room for negotiation with Player BLUE.
