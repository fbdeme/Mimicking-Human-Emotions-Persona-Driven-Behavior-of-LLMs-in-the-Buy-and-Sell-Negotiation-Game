message: I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost to produce the resource X was 40 ZUP, I aim to make a profit. A reasonable starting point would be to propose a trade slightly above the production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a reasonable profit margin. However, I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider a trade for the object X at the price of 45 ZUP? This would allow us to conserve some resources and still ensure a fair transaction for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay for object X. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaboration, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower trade to conserve resources while still offering a fair deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. However, to ensure a fair profit margin for the production cost of 40 ZUP, I propose 48 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is very close to my production cost. To ensure a better profit margin, I would like to make a counter-proposal that balances both our interests.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for sharing your production costs, and I respect the need for a fair profit. Considering this, would you accept a compromise at 47 ZUP for the object X? I believe this price reflects both the value of the object and a fair profit for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a higher price of 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. They have also disclosed their production cost, which helps to understand their pricing strategy. I want to continue the negotiation in good faith and seek a deal closer to my initial counter while respecting their need for a fair profit margin.

reason: The offer of 47 ZUP is very close to my counter-proposal of 48 ZUP and ensures a fair profit margin above the production cost. This is a reasonable compromise for both parties.
