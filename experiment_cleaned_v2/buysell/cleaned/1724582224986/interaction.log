message: Thank you for your offer. For cooperation and mutual benefit, I propose 30 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, my goal is to foster cooperation while reducing expenditure. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, so I will make a counter-proposal to open the discussions.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your proposal for 30 ZUP, but I would like to offer the object for 35 ZUP instead. Would you be willing to meet me there?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would not be profitable for me. I will counteroffer with a more acceptable price of 35 ZUP.
