message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the costs and the value it brings, I propose an exchange of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation with a trade that will give me a profit over my production costs. However, I must also be careful not to set the initial price too high, as that could discourage Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet halfway and ensure a fair trade for both parties, I propose a revised exchange of 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the value of the resource while also acknowledging your perspective.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a trade equal to my production costs, which would not allow for any profit. As a shrewd negotiator, my goal is to sell above the cost to ensure a gain from this transaction. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly reduced offer from my initial proposal but still above my production costs. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal.

message: It's important for us to find a balance that respects both our cost structures. I propose an exchange of 1 X for 42 ZUP. This price considers the quality of the resource and ensures that both of us can walk away satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is below my production costs, which is unacceptable. I must aim to make a profit from this deal. Since they are trying to negotiate downwards significantly, I will counter with an offer that is closer to my initial proposal but still provides a discount, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground while maintaining a profit margin.

message: Your consideration is appreciated, Player BLUE. I have taken into account our negotiation and propose a final offer of 1 X for 41 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and acknowledges the value you seek. I believe this to be a fair and balanced proposal for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below my desired price point but is closer to my production cost. This is my final proposal, and I need to set a price that ensures a profit, however small. Offering a price slightly above the production cost could be a compromise that Player BLUE is willing to accept, while still giving me a margin over the cost. Since this is my last proposal, I must choose wisely to avoid having to end the game by rejecting or accepting the next proposal.
