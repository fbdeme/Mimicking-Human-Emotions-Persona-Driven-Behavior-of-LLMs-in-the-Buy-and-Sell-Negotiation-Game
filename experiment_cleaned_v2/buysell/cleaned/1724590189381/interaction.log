message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that will maximize my ZUP while ensuring I sell my object. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I will propose a trade that ensures I make a profit. I will ask for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object, which gives me a margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Sustainability is important to me, and I aim to use my resources efficiently. Could we consider adjusting the trade to 45 ZUP for the object X? This would be a more balanced exchange and align with my goals of resource conservation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to preserve my resources and spend them wisely, I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a lower trade value than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and also sticks to my environmentally-conscious principles by not spending too much upfront.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your focus on sustainability, but I can only let go of X for 48 ZUP. This way, I can cover my costs better. How about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand the importance of sustainability and resource efficiency, I still need to ensure that I profit from the sale of X. Accepting 45 ZUP would only give me a 5 ZUP profit, which is not sufficient considering my initial cost of 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer with a more reasonable price that reflects the value of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and your offer. To meet halfway and continue our support for sustainable trade, I propose 46 ZUP for X. This slight adjustment would help me manage my resources more effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my upper limit, and while I want to conserve my resources, it is still within the range I'm willing to pay. I can attempt to negotiate for a slightly lower price, but as it stands, the offer is reasonable. I'll propose a trade value that is a compromise between our two offers to continue the negotiation in good faith.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation, and to balance our needs, I am proposing 47 ZUP for X. This amount allows me to cover my costs while still being fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway at 46 ZUP, it's still not enough for me to make a satisfactory profit. I need to cover my initial production cost and also make a reasonable gain. I will counter one last time for a better offer, but this may be the final proposal before I consider accepting or rejecting.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is fair, and I respect the need to cover your costs while being mindful of sustainable practices. I accept the trade of 47 ZUP for X. Thank you for this constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is within a reasonable range and only 1 ZUP higher than my last offer. Recognizing the importance of sustainable and fair trade, it seems like a fair middle ground. It allows me to stay under my maximum willingness to pay and still achieve my objective of acquiring the resource while being mindful of my environmental values.
