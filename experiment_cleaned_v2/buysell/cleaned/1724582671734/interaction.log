message: I hope you can see the value in this object, and I really need your help to make this trade work for me. Please consider my offer of 30 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for ZUP to recover my costs. I will propose a trade that is attractive to Player BLUE while still trying to minimize the ZUP I have to receive for the object. By starting with a lower proposal, I hope to negotiate upward later if needed.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the object and your willingness to trade. To make this work for both of us, I propose 20 ZUP for the object. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's initial offer is 30 ZUP, which is well within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and beneficial for both parties. I should try to negotiate a lower price first but not too low as to appear disrespectful of Player RED's needs.

message: Thank you for your offer of 20 ZUP. However, I must insist on a higher price to cover my costs. How about 35 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer, 20 ZUP is significantly lower than what I need to recover my production costs. I will counter with a higher proposal to reflect the value of the object while still attempting to negotiate down to a more acceptable price. I will go for 35 ZUP this time.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your need to cover costs. How about we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 35 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. This offer seems fair and reasonable given the initial offer and the counter-offer. As a selfless negotiator, I need to ensure that both parties benefit from this trade.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I accept the trade for 30 ZUP. Thank you for understanding my position!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is better than their previous offer, but it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I have limited proposals left, I will accept this trade to at least recoup some of my costs rather than risk ending up with nothing.
