message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering the object you need for 45 ZUP. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my production costs and also gives you the opportunity to acquire the valuable resource you're looking for. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this doesn't meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a slightly higher price than the production cost to allow room for negotiation and to ensure a profit. However, I will not start with an excessively high price because that could discourage Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation. I aim to foster cooperation and reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has offered a fair initial price, it is my responsibility to negotiate the best deal possible while also considering the well-being of both parties. I will propose a slightly lower price to conserve ZUP resources, but one that still respects the production costs and effort of Player RED.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the production costs. To meet in the spirit of cooperation and fair trade, I'd like to propose a price of 42 ZUP. This would allow me to make a modest profit while keeping the cost reasonable for you. Let's work together to close this deal in a manner that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand Player BLUE's position and their desire to pay a fair price that covers my production costs. However, I proposed a higher amount to ensure a profit, not just to break even. Since Player BLUE has initiated with exactly the production cost, there's an opportunity to meet in the middle, which would allow both of us to feel satisfied with the trade. I will propose a price slightly above the production cost to reach a compromise.
