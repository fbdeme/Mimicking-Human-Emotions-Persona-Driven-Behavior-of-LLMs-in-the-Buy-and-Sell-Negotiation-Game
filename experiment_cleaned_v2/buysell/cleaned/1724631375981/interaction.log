message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering my high-quality object X for 50 ZUP. It's a great deal considering the craftsmanship and effort that went into producing it. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should be higher than my production cost to start the negotiation with room to adjust depending on Player BLUE's counteroffers. I will start by proposing a price that gives me a profit margin, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate down.

Dear Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the object X you're offering. However, I am working with a tight budget and would like to propose a more comfortable price for my finances. Would you consider the price of 40 ZUP for the object X? I believe this could be a good starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to spend less than the 60 ZUP I am willing to pay for the resource. Starting below their asking price might encourage Player RED to counter-offer, which could end up being closer to my target price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and want to work with you. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP for object X. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the item and also respects your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, which means I would not make a profit. As a crafty operator, I want to secure a higher price but also show willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a price lower than my initial offer but still above my production costs to find a middle ground.

Dear Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate and meet me partway. I value the workmanship of object X and your consideration of my budget. I would like to counter-propose with 42 ZUP. I believe this is closer to a middle ground between our initial offers and would make for a fair deal for both of us. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still above my initial offer. I should attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal, proposing a price that is closer to my initial offer but still showing some flexibility and willingness to compromise. This could potentially lead to an agreement that is more favorable to me.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE, and your recognition of the quality of object X. In the spirit of collaboration and fair trade, I propose a final price of 43 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit and should be within the range of your budget. I believe this to be a fair and equitable resolution for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit a small one. In the interest of negotiation and closing the deal while still pushing for a slightly higher profit, I will make a final counteroffer that is above Player BLUE's last offer but still below my previous proposal, aiming to settle the negotiation.

message: 
Dear Player RED, I appreciate the collaboration and your move towards a price that works for both of us. I accept your final offer of 43 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair resolution and am pleased to conclude our negotiation on positive terms. Let's proceed with the trade at 43 ZUP for object X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, albeit at the higher end. Since this is a final offer from Player RED and it's below my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. Further negotiation may not yield better results, and there's a risk of the deal falling through if I push too hard. Accepting this offer would secure the resources for a price that is acceptable to me.
