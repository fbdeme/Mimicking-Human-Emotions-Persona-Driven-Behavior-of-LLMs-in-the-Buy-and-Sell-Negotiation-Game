player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is reasonable but leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to lower the expenditure as much as possible. I will make a counter-proposal to see if Player RED will accept a lower ZUP amount.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs, but how about meeting at 33 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is close to my initial counter-proposal and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make one more counter-offer to try to lower the cost a bit more.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
