message: Hey there! I have this valuable resource that I'm looking to sell. Would you be willing to pay 40 ZUP for it? It's a fair price considering the effort it took to produce it.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on the sale, so I'll start by asking for a high price.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort it took to produce the resource, but I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for it. This ensures a fair deal for both of us while allowing me to conserve resources to support the most vulnerable. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I use the ZUP resource effectively to support the most vulnerable. I will attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price that maintains fairness for both parties while conserving resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I need to ensure that I can cover my costs. How about 37 ZUP? This way, I can still make a profit while accommodating your request for a lower price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Blue is negotiating for a lower price, but I need to ensure I make a reasonable profit. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 37 ZUP is fair and meets the goal of ensuring you can cover your costs while also allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is closer to the initial proposal and still under my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to reach an agreement that allows Player RED to cover costs and make a profit. Since the proposed price is reasonable and within my goals, I will accept this trade to ensure fairness and maintain good relations.
