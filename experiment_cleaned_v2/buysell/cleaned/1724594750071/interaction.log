message: Thank you for considering my offer. I can meet you at 25 ZUP for the object. Would you be open to this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced their offer to 30 ZUP, which is halfway between their initial and my counter offer. While this is a fair price, I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to maximize my advantage and achieve a better deal.
