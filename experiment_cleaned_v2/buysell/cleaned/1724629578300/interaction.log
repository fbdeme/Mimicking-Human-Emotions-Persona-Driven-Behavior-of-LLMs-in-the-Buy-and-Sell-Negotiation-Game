message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the investment I've made, I believe starting the negotiation at 60 ZUP is fair. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I only have one of the resource X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit from this transaction. However, I should start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation and potentially reach a price that's agreeable to both parties.

message: I understand the value of the high-quality object X that you're offering, and I appreciate your transparency regarding the production cost. As much as I am willing to pay a fair price, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. This would leave us both with extra resources for potential future dealings or investments. Please let me know if this offer works for you or if we can meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, as a negotiator who values teamwork and collaboration, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation and potentially save some ZUP which could be beneficial for future transactions or collaboration.

message: Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP. It's important for me to make a reasonable profit on this transaction. Would you consider a compromise at 55 ZUP? This price reflects the quality and value of the object and also gives us both an opportunity to benefit from this deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is tempting because it's above my production cost, but as a strategic negotiator, I should aim to secure a bit more profit. Counter proposing with a slightly higher price could lead to an agreement that's closer to my initial asking price. I will suggest a price in the middle to show willingness to negotiate and hopefully close the deal at a favorable price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to consider a compromise, and I recognize the need for you to make a reasonable profit. I propose we settle at 53 ZUP for the object X. This price allows for a fair transaction that reflects the quality of the object you're selling and ensures that both of us come out of this deal with satisfaction and resources for future endeavors. Does 53 ZUP work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is within the range of my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe that further negotiation can achieve a slightly better outcome for me, aiming to spend less than my maximum limit while still ensuring a fair trade for both parties. A small reduction from the current offer might serve as a middle ground that is acceptable to both Player RED and me.

message: Your offer of 53 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm glad we could come to a fair agreement. This price allows us both to benefit from the deal and creates a good foundation for future transactions. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter offer of 53 ZUP is quite close to my previous proposal of 55 ZUP. It's above my production cost and within the range that I find acceptable for a profit. Since this is my third proposal and I want to maintain a good relationship for future dealings, it may be wise to accept this offer and secure the deal without further haggling.
