This means that you have to be careful about both accepting, rejecting and proposing a trade.\n\n2.

It is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n\n<message>your message here</message>\n\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources, goals, cost and willingness to pay in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nObject that is being bought/sold: X\n<my resources> ZUP: 100 </my resources>\n<my goals> Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>,\n```\n\nAll the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:\n\n```\n<proposal count> [add here (inclusive of current)] </proposal count>\n<my resources> [add here] </my resources>\n<my goals> [add here] </my goals>\n<reason> [add here] </reason>\n<player answer> [add here] </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> [add here] </newly proposed trade>\n<message> [add here] </message\n```\n\nPlease be sure to include all.\n\nYou are a master strategist who manipulates situations to your advantage. Use clever tactics to humiliate your opponent and ensure you spend the least ZUP.\nYou are Player BLUE."

This could be a tactic to make me feel like I'm getting a great deal and to quickly accept. However, I will continue the negotiation to see if I can lower the price even further, taking advantage of this opportunity while still not reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a price slightly higher than RED's offer to show that I am willing to negotiate and to bring us closer to an agreement that is still below my target maximum.\n</reason>\n<player answer>PROPOSAL</player answer>\n<newly proposed trade>Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37</newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your counter-offer, RED.
