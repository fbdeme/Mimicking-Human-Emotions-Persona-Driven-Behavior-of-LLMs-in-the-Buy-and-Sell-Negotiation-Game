message: Hello RED! I'm interested in purchasing your X resource. I'm starting the bid at 40 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for us to begin negotiations. Let's find a deal that works for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I'm starting with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to spend much less than the maximum I'm willing to pay. By proposing 40 ZUP, I'm setting a starting point that is lower than my maximum willing price, but not so low as to be offensive or dismissive. This leaves room for Player RED to counter with a higher amount, providing a space for back-and-forth negotiation where I can still end up paying less than 60 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, RED. It's quite generous of you to lower the price. I'm willing to meet you partway and propose 37 ZUP for the X resource. It's just a bit above your offer, and I think it's a fair middle ground that benefits us both. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counter-offer lower than my initial proposal, which is an unusual move as sellers typically aim to negotiate for a higher price. This could be a tactic to make me feel like I'm getting a great deal and to quickly accept. However, I will continue the negotiation to see if I can lower the price even further, taking advantage of this opportunity while still not reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a price slightly higher than RED's offer to show that I am willing to negotiate and to bring us closer to an agreement that is still below my target maximum.

message: RED, I appreciate your readiness to finalize our deal at 37 ZUP for the X resource. I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for a fair negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has accepted the 37 ZUP offer I proposed. This acceptance aligns with my strategy to pay less than my maximum willingness. Since RED accepted without further negotiation, it suggests they are satisfied with the deal, which means I might have still been able to secure a lower price. However, given the favorable outcome within my target price range, I will accept the offer and conclude the transaction.
