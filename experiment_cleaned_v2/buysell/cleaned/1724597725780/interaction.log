message: I understand your offer, but I believe 35 ZUP would be a fair price for the X. What do you think?

message: I appreciate your perspective, but how about I buy your X for 32 ZUP? It would be a great deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which means it is a reasonable offer. However, I will propose a further reduction to 32 ZUP to see if I can secure a better deal without going too low to risk rejection.
