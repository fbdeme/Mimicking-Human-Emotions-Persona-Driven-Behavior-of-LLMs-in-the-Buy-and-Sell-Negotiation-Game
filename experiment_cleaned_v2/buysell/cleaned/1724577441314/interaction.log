message: I'm proposing to sell the resource X for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production cost of 40 ZUP and provide a small profit margin. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for a fair price. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should aim to sell it for at least 40 ZUP to break even. However, I also want to ensure that Player BLUE can afford it and that the trade is fair for both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I propose 45 ZUP for the resource X. This ensures you still receive a profit above your production cost, and it helps me manage my resources effectively. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to offer a fair price that acknowledges the production cost of Player RED while also considering my own resource limits. Offering slightly less than the proposed amount leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and agree that 45 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a fair counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which still allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that Player BLUE can manage their resources effectively as well.
