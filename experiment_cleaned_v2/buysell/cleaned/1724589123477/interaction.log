my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I'm in a really tight spot right now and could really use your help. This object means a lot to me, and I'm stretching my budget as it is. Would you consider letting it go for 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your situation, but I can let it go for 35 ZUP. I hope this helps you out a bit more. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that you are in a tight spot, accepting 30 ZUP would put me at a loss since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even. I will propose a counter-offer that is still lower than my initial proposal, but closer to my break-even point.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding and for your kindness. Things are just really hard right now, and every ZUP saved helps immensely. Could you consider 32 ZUP? I'm really hoping to make ends meet, and your generosity could make a significant difference.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will try another emotional appeal to see if I can get the price down a little more. I have a couple more proposals I can make if this doesn't work.

message: I truly sympathize with your situation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at 34 ZUP. I hope this can work for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I can see that the negotiation is becoming more emotional, and while I empathize with your situation, accepting 32 ZUP is still below my break-even point. I will propose a final counter-offer of 34 ZUP, which is a slight concession but still keeps me from a loss.
