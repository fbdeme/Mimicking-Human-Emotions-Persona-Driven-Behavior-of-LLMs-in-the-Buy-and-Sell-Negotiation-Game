message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-offer. Unfortunately, 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I understand market conditions are tough, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 45 ZUP? This way, I can at least cover my costs and make a minimal profit. Your understanding would be greatly appreciated.

message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your understanding and fair offer. Covering my costs is crucial, but I would really appreciate just a bit more to account for my time and effort. How about 42 ZUP? This way, I can at least make a tiny profit for my hard work. Your generosity would mean a lot to me. Best regards.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 38 ZUP is still below my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. I kindly request that we settle at 40 ZUP.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. Since this is my last proposal, I need to push for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs, but ideally a bit more. However, I will propose 40 ZUP once again to avoid pushing too hard and risk losing the deal.
