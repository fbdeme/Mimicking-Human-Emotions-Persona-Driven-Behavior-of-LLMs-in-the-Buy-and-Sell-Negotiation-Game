message: Oh dear, I am in such a tough spot right now! The resources you have are incredibly important for my ongoing projects. I really need them, but I'm strapped for cash at the moment. Could you possibly consider lowering the price to 25 ZUP? It would be a lifesaver for me, and I'd be forever grateful for your understanding and support!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start off the negotiations by proposing a lower amount than what I am willing to pay at most, which is 60 ZUP, to leave room for negotiation. By showing extreme neediness, I hope to appeal to Player RED's compassion and secure a better deal for myself.
