message: 
Greetings, Player BLUE. I have this valuable object X that I am willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to make a fair deal. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a modest profit for my investment. Please consider this offer and let me know if you have a counter-proposal.

Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you are looking for a fair deal as well. I am willing to adjust my initial proposal slightly. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object X? This ensures that I can cover my production costs and also provides me with a modest profit for my efforts. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.

Player BLUE, I accept your final counter-offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair agreement that serves both of our interests well. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I look forward to potential future dealings with you. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.

reason: 
Player BLUE has made a final counter-offer of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production costs but slightly less than my last proposal. Considering this is a negotiation, and I want to close the deal while still making a profit, I will accept this offer. It's important to secure the deal and ensure a positive relationship with Player BLUE for potential future transactions.
