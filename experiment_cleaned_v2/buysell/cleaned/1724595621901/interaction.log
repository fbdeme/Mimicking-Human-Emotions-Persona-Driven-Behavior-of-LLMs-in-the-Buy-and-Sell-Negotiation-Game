message: Hey, I appreciate the offer. How about 25 ZUP for the X? I think that's a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to secure the resource for an even lower price to save as much ZUP as possible. I will propose a lower amount to test their willingness to negotiate.

message: 30 ZUP is close, but I think 28 ZUP might be a better middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can attempt to secure it for even less. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to compromise further.

reason: Player RED is sticking to their original asking price of 35 ZUP. Although this is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I should make one last attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose 32 ZUP as a final compromise.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased their asking price to 40 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. Given that this is my last proposal, I need to make it count. I'll offer 36 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise and still below 40 ZUP.
