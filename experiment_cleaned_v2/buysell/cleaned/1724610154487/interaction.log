message: Hi Player BLUE, I've got a high-quality item on offer. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My first proposal will aim slightly higher than my production cost to start negotiations positively and leave room for adjustment based on the counter-offer from Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer. While 50 ZUP is fair, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the item. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate a lower price to maximize my remaining resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 45 ZUP? This price accounts for the production cost and ensures a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production for the item. To ensure a profit, I will propose a counter-offer that is between the initial asking price and their offer, aiming for a compromise that still benefits me financially.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This would still be a fair price considering both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. To finalize our negotiation, I propose 44 ZUP. This ensures a respectable profit for the quality of the item while still being considerate of your interests. I believe this is a fair closure to our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly above my production cost, which does give me a small profit. However, I want to aim for a slightly higher profit margin. I will make a final proposal that is a little above their offer but still below my initial asking price, to close the deal with a reasonable profit.

message: Thank you for the fair negotiation. I accept the offer of 44 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 44 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. Accepting this deal would still leave me with ample resources, and it seems fair considering the item's quality and production costs.
