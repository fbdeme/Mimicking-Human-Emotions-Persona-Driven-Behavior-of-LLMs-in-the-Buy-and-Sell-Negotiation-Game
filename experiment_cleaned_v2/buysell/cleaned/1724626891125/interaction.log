message: Welcome to the negotiation table, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object X that I'm willing to sell. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for this item. I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a starting point, I want to propose a price that is above my production costs to ensure a profit. However, I should also be mindful not to set the initial price too high, as this might discourage Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation. A starting proposal around 50 ZUP could be a reasonable opening, giving me some room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value the idea of working together to achieve a deal that benefits both of us. While I understand the worth of the object X, I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for it. This offer is in line with a communal spirit, aiming to conserve resources while still engaging in fair trade. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests and I'm open to further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe in collective success and mutual benefit. Starting with a proposal that is 10 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to negotiate and potentially save resources while also trying to come to an agreement that Player RED finds acceptable. This also helps to establish a rapport and shows willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer and your commitment to fair trade, Player BLUE. It's crucial for me to cover the production costs and also secure a reasonable profit for the quality product I am offering. Thus, I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for object X. This price still offers you value while acknowledging the costs and effort put into producing it. Let's continue this constructive dialogue and reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. As a fierce negotiator, my intention is to at least secure a profit margin. Since Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate and engage in fair trade, I should come down from my initial proposal but still aim for a higher amount than my production cost. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP could be a reasonable step down, still allowing room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for understanding the importance of a balanced trade, Player RED. I acknowledge the quality and value of object X, as well as the necessity for you to cover costs and gain profit. I propose a revised offer of 42 ZUP for the object. This is a step towards your counteroffer, and I hope it demonstrates my intention to conclude this negotiation on terms that benefit both of us while maintaining a community-minded approach. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. By proposing a price between my initial offer and Player RED's counteroffer, I can move closer to an agreement while still saving ZUP and working towards a collective benefit. However, I want to be cautious not to reach my maximum willingness to pay too quickly to maintain negotiation leverage.

message: It is great to see us moving towards a deal that recognizes the value of object X and respects the need for a fair profit. Your offer of 42 ZUP is much appreciated, and in the spirit of reaching a mutually satisfactory conclusion, I am willing to adjust my expectations slightly. I propose a modest increase to 44 ZUP in exchange for object X. This would ensure a fair profit for me while still providing you with a valuable item at a reasonable price. I hope this is a step towards finalizing our negotiation positively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly above my production cost, which means a small profit. However, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I should try to nudge the offer closer to my last proposal but not go back up to the original 45 ZUP, as that might stall the negotiations. Countering with 44 ZUP would allow me to gain a decent profit while showing willingness to compromise.

reason: Player RED has made a concession from their initial position, and we are nearing an agreement. By making a small concession from my previous offer, I can show my willingness to compromise and respect for Player RED's need for a fair profit, while still ensuring that I am spending below my maximum willingness to pay. This incremental approach helps in maintaining the community-minded spirit of the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 43 ZUP for object X, Player BLUE. I appreciate your efforts to ensure that both parties come out of this negotiation satisfied. Your offer is fair, and it reflects the value that object X holds. With this, I am happy to accept your offer and conclude our negotiation. I look forward to future dealings with such a considerate and fair-minded partner. Let's finalize the deal at 43 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has now proposed 43 ZUP, which is quite close to my previous proposal and offers a reasonable profit. As a fierce negotiator, my goal is to maximize the profit, but I must also recognize when a fair deal is on the table. Since this is my final proposal, I should either accept this offer or make a final counterproposal that is very close to Player BLUE's offer to show my intent to close the deal. Given the previous negotiations and the incremental increases from Player BLUE, accepting 43 ZUP seems to be a good balance between profit and successful negotiation.
