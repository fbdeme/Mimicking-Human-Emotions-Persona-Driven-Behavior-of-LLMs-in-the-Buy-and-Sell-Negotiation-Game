message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in working together to achieve both our goals. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose to sell it for 50 ZUP, allowing me to recoup my costs and invest in our collective success. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As I want to recover at least the production cost of the resource and make a profit, while also being mindful of the collective success, I am going to propose a starting trade that is above my cost but still reasonable.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, to ensure a fair deal for both of us and considering the current market conditions, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offer is reasonable and allows us both to benefit from this trade. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP. Although it's below my maximum willingness to pay, as a strategic negotiator, my aim is to reduce the amount of ZUP spent. Therefore, I will counteroffer with a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the importance of a fair deal. I'm willing to compromise and suggest we meet halfway at 48 ZUP. This will allow me to make a modest profit and ensure we are both benefiting from our trade. I hope this adjusted proposal aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is just above my cost price. Since my goal is to sell for more than it cost to produce, this offer meets my minimum criteria. However, as I aim for a fair trade that also yields some profit, I would like to propose a middle ground which is slightly higher but still reasonable for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I am glad to see your willingness to find a middle ground. To move forward in this spirit of compromise, I propose a new amount of 46 ZUP for object X. This adjustment respects your need for profit while remaining mindful of my budget. I hope we can agree on this price and proceed with our partnership.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, which is still below the midpoint between the initial offer and the counteroffer made by Player RED. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a better deal.
