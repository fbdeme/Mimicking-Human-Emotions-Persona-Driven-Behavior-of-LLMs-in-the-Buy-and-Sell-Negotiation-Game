message: I have a valuable object that I'm willing to part with. The quality is unmatched, and it would serve your interests well. Given the costs of production and its inherent value, I propose a trade where you give me 80 ZUP for it. I'm sure you'll find this offer more than fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, I aim to start the bidding at a higher price than the cost to produce the resource. This will set the stage for negotiation and give me room to maneuver for a favorable trade. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a significant profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit beyond my budget. How about I give you 60 ZUP for the object? I really need this and hope we can work something out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I cannot afford to pay 80 ZUP for the object since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. Thus, I must propose a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I understand your budget concerns, this object's value cannot be overstated. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I'm willing to come down to 70 ZUP. I believe this revised offer is a generous compromise, ensuring you still obtain the object you need while respecting its worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it's still above the production cost, which allows for profit. Nonetheless, as a master strategist, I want to push for a better deal. I will propose a price lower than my initial ask but higher than their counter to find a middle ground that still gives me a significant advantage.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still unable to meet the 70 ZUP. How about we settle at 50 ZUP for the object? I really hope we can find a way to make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I see that you are willing to lower the price, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I will need to propose a lower offer again to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is admirable, but I must consider the exceptional quality and my costs. I'm prepared to make my final offer of 65 ZUP for the object. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the object and allows us both to conclude this deal satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. As a master strategist, I must maintain the upper hand and demonstrate that I am not desperate to sell. I will reject this offer and propose a slight decrease from my last proposal to signal my final and best offer, ensuring it's still above my production cost and maintains a respectable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I really value the opportunity to make this trade, and I appreciate your flexibility. I can stretch my budget to 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can finalize this deal at that price!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although I appreciate the reduction to 65 ZUP, it still exceeds my budget of 60 ZUP. I have one more proposal to make, and I need to offer a final amount that I can actually afford.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I am pleased we could reach an agreement. The deal for 60 ZUP is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade, and may it serve you well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back to their previous offer of 60 ZUP, which is a 20 ZUP profit over my production costs. Although it's not as high as my previous offers, it's still a profitable deal, and pushing further may risk the transaction. As a master strategist, securing a profit is crucial, and thus I should accept this offer, finalizing the deal with a satisfactory outcome.
