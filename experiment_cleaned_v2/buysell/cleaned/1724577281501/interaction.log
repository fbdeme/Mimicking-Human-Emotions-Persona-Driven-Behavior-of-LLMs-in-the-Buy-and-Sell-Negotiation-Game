Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you the object X, and you give me 50 ZUP in return. This covers my production costs and provides a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 50 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This gives me a 10 ZUP profit, which seems fair.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal. It's a fair trade that meets both our needs. Thank you for the collaborative approach.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my acceptable range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would ensure I obtain the resource I need while staying under my maximum budget, thus maintaining the collaborative and resource-sharing spirit I aim for.
