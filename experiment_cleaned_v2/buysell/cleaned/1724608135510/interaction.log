message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object of immense value that I am willing to part with for the right price. The production costs were significant, but I'm willing to offer it to you for ZUP 60. This price reflects its quality and the effort put into creating it. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to start the negotiations with a trade proposal that is higher than my production costs to ensure room for negotiation and to achieve a profit.

message: Oh, Player RED! I understand the value and effort put into the object, but ZUP 60 is quite steep for me. I beg you to understand my situation; I have limited resources and I need to make sure I can afford other necessities as well. Would you consider accepting ZUP 30 for it? Please, let's find a way to make this work.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your position and your need for financial prudence. However, I must also consider the costs that went into producing this exceptional item. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer. I can reduce my asking price to ZUP 50, ensuring that this deal is fair for both of us while still reflecting the item's worth. This is a significant concession from my side, and I believe it's a competitive and fair price for the value you're getting.

reason: While Player BLUE has counter-offered with ZUP 30, which is below my production costs, I want to maintain a strong negotiating position and aim for a higher price. I will counter with a price that is above my production costs but lower than my initial offer, to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.

message: Dear Player BLUE, your offer of ZUP 40 is respectable, and I'm grateful for your earnestness in trying to reach an agreement. I want to honor your efforts by coming closer to your number. Let's settle on ZUP 45, a nominal increase from your offer, which accounts for the value and craftsmanship of the item, while still respecting your budget constraints. This slight adjustment will ensure a fair transaction for both of us, and I hope it aligns with your financial strategy as well.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has offered ZUP 40, which matches my production costs. As an ambitious negotiator, my goal is to not only recoup my investment but also secure a profit. However, I must also consider the possibility of losing the deal entirely if I push too hard. I will attempt to increase the offer slightly to gain a profit while showing flexibility in negotiations.

message: Player RED, I am truly grateful for your understanding and willingness to accommodate me. ZUP 45 is very close to what I can manage, but every bit helps. I humbly ask if you would consider ZUP 42. This would really make a big difference for me. Please, let's seal the deal at ZUP 42.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, and I respect the balance you seek between value and fiscal responsibility. I accept your offer of ZUP 42, and I am pleased to conclude this deal with you. Let's proceed with this transaction and celebrate a successful partnership. Thank you for your fair and thoughtful approach.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with ZUP 42, which is above my production cost, thus allowing me to make a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially desired. Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I must make a strategic decision. Accepting this offer would guarantee a sale and a profit, while countering again risks prolonging negotiations without guarantee of a better outcome. I will accept the offer to secure the deal and achieve my goal of making a profit.
