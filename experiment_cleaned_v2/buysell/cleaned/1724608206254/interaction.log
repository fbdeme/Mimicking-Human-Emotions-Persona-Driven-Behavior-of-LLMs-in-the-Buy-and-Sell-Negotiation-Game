message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Given the costs and the value it offers, I'm starting the bid at 60 ZUP. I believe it's a fair price for the quality you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only 1 X to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit on this transaction. I will start by asking for a higher amount to give room for negotiation and to assert dominance in the negotiation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your predicament, and I appreciate your candidness. However, I also need to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. The best I can do is lower the price to 50 ZUP, which is a fair compromise given the quality of X and my investment in it. I believe this is a competitive offer that also respects your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated their resources are limited and they are in a desperate situation, which could be a negotiating tactic. However, selling at cost doesn't allow for any profit. I need to assert dominance by maintaining a higher price but offer a slight concession to keep the negotiation moving forward.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 50 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. However, I will attempt one more negotiation to see if I can save a bit more. If not, I will consider accepting the current proposal.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I value our potential partnership and your current financial constraints. I'm willing to meet you partway at 48 ZUP, which I believe is a fair middle ground for both of us. This small adjustment from my last offer should help seal the deal while ensuring a fair transaction for the quality of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to my initial asking price, which is a good sign. Offering 45 ZUP is above my production cost, providing me with a profit. However, I want to maintain a strong position and aim for a slightly higher price to maximize my returns. I'll counter with a small reduction to still assert dominance but also show willingness to close the deal.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for your understanding and flexibility. I truly appreciate it. Could we possibly agree on 46 ZUP? It's a small tweak, but it would make a significant difference for me. I hope we can find common ground here.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. I appreciate Player RED's willingness to compromise. However, I will try one last attempt to negotiate it down slightly more. If unsuccessful, I will likely accept the current offer.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, and in the spirit of mutual benefit, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP. I'm confident that X will serve your needs well. Let's proceed with this deal and look forward to potential future transactions. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a price closer to their initial counteroffer. Since this is my final proposal, I must make it count. Offering at 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. To maintain my bargaining power and conclude the negotiation on my terms, I will accept this offer, demonstrating finality in my decision-making and a willingness to conclude the deal profitably.
