message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit and ensure the quality of the resource you're receiving. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even, but I would also like to make a profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade at a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
