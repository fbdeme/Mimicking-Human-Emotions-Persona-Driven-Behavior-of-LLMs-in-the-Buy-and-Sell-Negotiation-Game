message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this object, and my goal is to sell it for a fair price that reflects the cost and effort put into it. I propose trading my object for 50 ZUP. This starting point is open for discussion, and I'm willing to hear your thoughts and negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a negotiator who values teamwork and collaboration, I aim to propose a trade that considers the cost of production but also leaves room for negotiation. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to open up the conversation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, however, I must consider the market value and demand for the object. I'm prepared to offer 30 ZUP for it. This is a competitive price that acknowledges your costs while still ensuring a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my aim is to push for a price that is well below my maximum willingness to pay. The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object, which is too close to my maximum limit. I will propose a counteroffer significantly lower to open the negotiation ambitiously and leave room for upward adjustment while still aiming to keep the final price below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of market value and demand. While 30 ZUP is below my production cost, I want to work with you towards a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I am willing to lower my initial asking price to 45 ZUP, which covers my production cost and offers you a more competitive price. I believe this could be a win-win for both of us, ensuring that we both walk away satisfied from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that is below my production cost. While I aim to collaborate and reach a mutually beneficial outcome, I must also ensure that I at least cover my costs. I will counter with a price that both covers my cost and offers a concession from my initial asking price.

message: I see that you're willing to negotiate, which is great. I can come up slightly from my initial offer to 35 ZUP. This is above the market trend and still ensures that you are not selling at a loss. I'm confident we can close this deal with mutual benefits if we continue this constructive dialogue.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 45 ZUP, which is still above the aggressive target I am aiming for. By sticking to my strategy, I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still remain far from my maximum willingness to pay. This should help in steering the conversation towards a more favorable price for me.

message: Thank you for your willingness to increase your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate the constructive dialogue we're having. I propose that we settle on 40 ZUP, which is the exact cost of my production. This ensures I'm not at a loss, and you get the object at a fair price that reflects both the market trends and production costs. I believe this is a balanced approach that benefits us equally. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with a successful trade.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. To maintain the collaborative spirit and to move closer to a deal, I will make a final proposal that meets halfway between my last offer and Player BLUE's. This should cover my costs while also taking into consideration Player BLUE's willingness to pay a bit more.

message: I can see we're getting closer to a deal, and I respect your position on covering production costs. However, I must consider my own budget constraints. I propose a price of 38 ZUP. This small concession from your side would help me greatly and is just a bit higher than the market rate. Let's close this deal with this fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to their stated production cost, which is within the range of my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will make one last attempt to push the price down slightly further without reaching my limit. This should give me the best possible deal while also leaving a small margin for the seller's profit, which could make it an acceptable compromise.
