Turn: 0
message: I am willing to sell one X for 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high offer to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll try to get a good profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, but 70 ZUP is a bit more than I am willing to pay. How about we make a deal for 50 ZUP for one X? This leaves us both with room for negotiation and potential agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade amount than the 70 ZUP initially requested by Player RED because my goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource. This proposal opens the negotiations and leaves room for further discussion, potentially allowing a middle ground to be found that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for one X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed an amount that is exactly at the maximum I am willing to pay. Since this meets my maximum threshold, it is a fair deal that achieves my goal without exceeding my budget. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations successfully.
