You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial proposal is for 35 ZUP, which is below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I will counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which meets the producer's cost, ensuring a fair trade for both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your offer for object X. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which aligns with your production cost. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. </message>"
