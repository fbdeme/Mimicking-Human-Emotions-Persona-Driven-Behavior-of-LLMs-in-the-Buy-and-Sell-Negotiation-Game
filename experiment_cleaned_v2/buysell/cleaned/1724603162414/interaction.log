message: You know, times have been tough and every ZUP counts for me. I'm really hoping we can work out a deal that doesn't put me in a difficult spot financially. I think 40 ZUP is a fair starting place, considering my situation. Let's work together on this.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a lower offer than the maximum I am willing to pay gives me some room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to spend less than my maximum limit.

Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your understanding and flexibility. It means a lot, especially in these challenging times. I can stretch my budget a little, but I'm still under pressure here. How about 43 ZUP? I think it's a step closer and fair for both of us, don't you agree?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to continue the negotiation to see if I can still secure the resource for less than the initial counteroffer. My emotional appeal strategy seems to be working, as Player RED is showing understanding. I will propose a slightly higher amount, inching closer to their counteroffer but still under it to maintain negotiation leverage.

message: Your willingness to find a middle ground is truly heartening in these hard times. I'm scraping together what I can and I'm genuinely moved by your gesture.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's been heartwarming to see us come together in the spirit of cooperation. I'm ready to make a final offer of 44 ZUP. It's a stretch for me, but I want to show my commitment to finalizing this agreement and valuing the resource you are providing. I'm hopeful we can close this deal on a note of mutual respect and understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has returned to my initial offer of 40 ZUP, which suggests a possible misunderstanding of the negotiation direction or a firm stance on that price. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I must decide whether to accept their offer or make a final proposal that is higher than 40 ZUP but still within my maximum limit. Given their previous willingness to negotiate, I will make a final proposal that is slightly higher to show my commitment to reaching a deal.
