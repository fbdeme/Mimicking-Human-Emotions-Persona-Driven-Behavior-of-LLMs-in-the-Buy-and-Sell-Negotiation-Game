message: 
I'm really in a bind here. Resources are tight, and I can only spare 20 ZUP for the object. I hope you understand my situation and can consider my offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay to open up room for negotiation and to maintain the appearance of being in a tight spot financially. This might make the seller more inclined to lower their price out of sympathy or in fear that I cannot afford a higher price.

message: I understand your situation, but I need to cover the production cost. How about 25 ZUP for 1 X?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: 
I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here, but because I really need this, I can stretch to 23 ZUP. It's more than I should be spending, but I'm hoping we can make it work with your understanding of my tight budget.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down from the initial 30 ZUP to 25 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than my first to signal that I am willing to compromise but still maintain the image of financial constraint to keep the price as low as possible.

message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. How about 28 ZUP for 1 X? This is the best I can offer given the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to stretch their budget, but it's still below the production cost. I need to decide if I can accept this offer or propose a final counteroffer.

message: 
I'm really pushing my limits here, but I can see you're trying to work with me. I can go up to 26 ZUP, and that's honestly the best I can do without putting myself in a tough spot. I hope we can close the deal at this price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller is attempting to close the deal at a higher price than my last offer. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be cautious and aim for a final offer that both fits within my strategy and appears to be a stretch for my budget. I'll propose a price that is closer to their last offer but still below it.
