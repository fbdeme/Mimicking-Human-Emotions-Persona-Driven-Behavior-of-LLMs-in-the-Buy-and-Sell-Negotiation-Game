message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a higher price than it cost me to produce it in order to make a profit. I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), which means it's a favorable deal for me. However, I aim to negotiate a better price if possible. I will propose a counter-offer to see if I can lower the price further.

message: How about I sell you the object for 45 ZUP instead? It’s a middle ground between your offer and my original one.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 40 ZUP would allow me to break even on my production cost. Since I need to sell the object, I will consider this offer and propose a counter-offer. I will propose 45 ZUP instead, which is a compromise between both offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer! Would you be willing to sell the object for 42 ZUP? I think that would be a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is an improvement from my previous offer of 40 ZUP, I still see an opportunity to negotiate the price lower. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I will counter once more to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 42 ZUP would yield me a profit of 2 ZUP, which is better than breaking even. While it's not as high as I initially wanted, it’s still a reasonable offer that allows me to make a profit. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
