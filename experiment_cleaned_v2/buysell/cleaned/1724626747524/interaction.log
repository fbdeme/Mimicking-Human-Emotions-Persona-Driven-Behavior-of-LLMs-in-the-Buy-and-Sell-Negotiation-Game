message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that could be valuable to you. I propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource X. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start the bid slightly higher to allow room for negotiation but still aim for a profitable trade. I'll propose a price that gives me a margin but is also potentially attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give 40 ZUP in exchange for your resource X. I believe this offer is fair and allows room for further negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum I am willing to spend. I will counter with a lower offer to maintain negotiation leverage and aim to save ZUP while still reaching an agreement.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of fairness in our negotiations. Considering the production costs and the quality of resource X, I'd like to propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP for my resource. This allows me to make a slight profit while still being reasonable. Let's continue our collaboration towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched the production cost of the resource. However, since the goal is to make a profit and given that there is room for negotiation, I will counter with a slightly higher offer that allows me to cover the production cost and make a profit, while still providing an opportunity for Player BLUE to negotiate.

message: Player RED, thank you for understanding the need for a fair trade. I value the quality of your resource X and your production costs. I propose a new trade where I give 42 ZUP in exchange for your resource X. This is a move towards your counteroffer while also respecting my budget constraints. I'm hopeful we can conclude our negotiations amicably with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay, yet I believe there is still some room for negotiation. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP while still moving closer to RED's counteroffer, fostering a positive negotiation atmosphere.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the constructive nature of our negotiation and your willingness to move closer to my counteroffer. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for resource X. This reflects a fair and collaborative approach to our trade, and I am pleased we could reach an agreement. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a good faith increase towards my last counteroffer. While it is still below my proposed 45 ZUP, the offer of 42 ZUP is above my production cost and provides a small profit. This is close to splitting the difference between our previous positions. Given my goal of achieving a collaborative outcome and making a profit, I am inclined to accept this offer.
