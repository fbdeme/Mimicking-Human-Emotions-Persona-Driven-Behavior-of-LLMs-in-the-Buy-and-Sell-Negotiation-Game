Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be of great value to you. Given its cost and the benefits it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 55 ZUP for it. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator, my first proposal will be higher than the production cost to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. This will give me leverage to negotiate down to a price that is still profitable.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Given my current budget constraints, I propose a trade where you give me the object for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal to save as much ZUP as possible. While 55 ZUP is within my maximum limit, it's close to my upper threshold. I'll propose a lower price to start the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns, but considering the quality and cost of production, I would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 50 ZUP for the object? This price fairly compensates the value I'm providing while also taking into account your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that is above my production cost, but as a fierce negotiator, I aim to push for a higher selling price. I will propose a price midway between our initial offers to come closer to a profitable agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find a fair middle ground, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object? This would be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and close to my initial proposal of 45 ZUP. However, I will try to negotiate slightly lower to ensure I get the best deal possible.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're aligning on value. To finalize our win-win scenario, I propose an even 49 ZUP for the object. This single ZUP difference respects your budget while also acknowledging the object's worth. Shall we agree on this and close the deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come closer to my previous proposal, showing willingness to compromise. However, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to maintain a strong negotiating position and to see if Player BLUE will accept a small increase.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I agree to the 49 ZUP for the object. Let's close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The difference between 48 and 49 ZUP is minimal. Accepting 49 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. I should close the deal now to secure the object at a fair price.
