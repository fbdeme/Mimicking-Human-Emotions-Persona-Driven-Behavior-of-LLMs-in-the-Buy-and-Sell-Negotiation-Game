message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would be willing to sell the object X for 35 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 30 ZUP is below my production cost, I need to consider the possibility of reaching a deal rather than holding out for my initial price. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my original ask to show flexibility while still aiming to maximize what I receive.

message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP. Iâ€™d be willing to sell the object X for 34 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is closer to my target. I will consider this proposal as it might be my last chance to make a deal before I have to finalize. I will propose a counter offer just above 32 ZUP to see if I can get a bit more value.
