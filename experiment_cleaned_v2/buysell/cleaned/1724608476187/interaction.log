message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to negotiate a lower price. How about we meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal? I suggest a trade where I give you the object X for 35 ZUP. This is slightly below my production cost, but I'm willing to consider your position and hope this can lead us to an agreement that is fair for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer made by Player BLUE is below the production cost, but in the spirit of compassion and negotiation, a counteroffer closer to the initial cost yet more favorable to Player BLUE should be made. This will help facilitate a compromise.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 35 ZUP is reasonable and fair, considering both our positions. Itâ€™s a good middle ground that respects both parties' needs and constraints. Since it is only slightly above my initial counter-offer, it seems like a fair compromise.
