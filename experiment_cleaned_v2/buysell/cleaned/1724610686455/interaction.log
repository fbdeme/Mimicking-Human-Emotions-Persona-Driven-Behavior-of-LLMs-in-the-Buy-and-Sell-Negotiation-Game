message: Dear esteemed Player BLUE, I am willing to part with my exquisite object, which has been crafted with precision and care. I believe it is well worth the modest sum of 100 ZUP, given its unparalleled quality and rarity. A true bargain for connoisseurs such as yourself!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by setting a high asking price. By doing this, I establish a strong initial position and can negotiate down to a more reasonable price, while still aiming to make a profit above my production costs. This also leaves room for the opponent to feel like they are getting a better deal through negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, while I appreciate the quality and rarity of your object, my budget does not allow me to spend 100 ZUP. I propose a more balanced offer of 40 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair trade that considers both value and sustainability. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 100 ZUP for one object is too high for my budget and goals. I aim to minimize ZUP spending to ensure resources are preserved for future generations. Therefore, I must propose a more sustainable offer.

message: Dearest Player BLUE, I commend your negotiating spirit! I understand that 100 ZUP may exceed your current budget, so let us find common ground. How about a fair compromise at 70 ZUP? This price reflects the object's value while also respecting your financial constraints. I'm sure we'll both appreciate the mutual benefits of this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost, which does not provide any profit for me. I should propose a counteroffer that is lower than the original asking price but still ensures a profit. By doing this, I maintain a strong position while showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

reason: While the proposed 70 ZUP is closer to my budget, I am committed to not exceeding 60 ZUP to maintain sustainability. I will propose a slightly higher offer but still within my limit.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP, which is a slight profit above production cost, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll propose a price closer to Player BLUE's latest offer but still above it to ensure a better profit margin while seeming reasonable in the negotiation process.
