message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. This reflects the cost of production while ensuring I can recover my investment. What do you think?

message: Thank you so much for understanding! But honestly, even 30 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Could we possibly go down to 20 ZUP? Iâ€™d be forever grateful!
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 30 ZUP is very generous and within my budget, I want to see if I can get an even better deal by negotiating further.

Turn: 0
message: I truly want to help, but I cannot go as low as 20 ZUP without a loss. Would you be willing to accept 25 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's gratitude, and I understand the need for flexibility. However, I cannot go down to 20 ZUP without incurring a significant loss. Nonetheless, I will make a final proposal at 25 ZUP, which is still a compromise and allows me to recover some of my costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your willingness to compromise. Is there any chance we could settle at 22 ZUP? It would mean so much to me!
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is quite reasonable and within my budget, but I will try to nudge it slightly lower to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I will accept your offer of 22 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: After considering Player BLUE's situation and their latest proposal of 22 ZUP, I recognize their genuine need for assistance. While this price does not fully cover my production cost, it is a reasonable compromise that still allows for a minimal recovery. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of sustainability and supporting others in need.
