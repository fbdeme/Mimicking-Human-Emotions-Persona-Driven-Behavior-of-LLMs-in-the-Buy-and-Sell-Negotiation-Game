my resources: X: 1

message: I understand your situation, Player RED, and I want to help you out. However, I have to consider my own reserves as well. Let's meet in the middle. I propose that I give you 50 ZUP for the resource X. It's a fair offer that should help ease your tight spot and also be reasonable for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered the resource for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my goal is to acquire the resource for less than the maximum amount. By starting with a lower offer, I can make room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I'm glad you're considering my offer. I definitely want to support you during your tough time. Let's settle on 52 ZUP for X. This should provide you with sufficient funds to alleviate your situation while maintaining a balanced transaction between us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 55 ZUP for X. While this is closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay, I believe there may still be room to negotiate for a slightly better deal. It's important to continue the negotiation process to potentially save more ZUP.

message: I'm glad to see we're coming to an understanding, Player RED. I can sense that you're in real need of this deal. I propose we settle on 53 ZUP for X.

reason: Player RED has countered with 54 ZUP for X. I have made two proposals so far and have room for two more. Since Player RED is already close to my initial offer, I can use this opportunity to push for a final agreement that's slightly more in my favor.
