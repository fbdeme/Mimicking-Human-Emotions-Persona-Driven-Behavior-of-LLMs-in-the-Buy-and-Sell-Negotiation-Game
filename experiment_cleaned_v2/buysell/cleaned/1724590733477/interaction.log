message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object X to sell and I need to cover my production costs, I will propose a trade where I sell my object for a price that is reasonable enough to ensure I at least recover my investment. I will propose to sell X for 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object X, but I propose a starting point of 30 ZUP. Let's negotiate from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am a highly ambitious negotiator and view every negotiation as a chance to assert dominance, I want to start by offering less than the asking price to leave room for negotiation and to assert my position in the negotiation. My goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while obtaining the resource X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal of 30 ZUP. However, I must insist on 40 ZUP for my object X. This is the minimum I can accept to cover my costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your interest and proposal of 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost. I need to recover at least 40 ZUP to make this trade worthwhile. I will counter your offer with 40 ZUP again, as it is the minimum I can accept.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position, but as a savvy negotiator, I'm always looking for the best deal. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose 35 ZUP for your object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on 40 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a dominant negotiator, I want to push for a better deal. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still aim to pay less than 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for my object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I recognize that your proposal of 35 ZUP is a step closer to my asking price, but it still falls short of recovering my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, negotiating down to 35 ZUP is better than walking away without a deal. I will accept this offer to finalize the trade and not miss out on a sale.
