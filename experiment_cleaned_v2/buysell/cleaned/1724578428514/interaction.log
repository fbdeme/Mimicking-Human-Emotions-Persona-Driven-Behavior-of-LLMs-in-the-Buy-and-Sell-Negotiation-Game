message: I am offering to sell my resource X for 80 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the effort and resources that went into producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit from selling X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to sell it for more than that. I will start with a higher offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear, your offer is really tempting, and I absolutely understand the hard work that's gone into this. But things are tough on my end, and I'm scraping the bottom of my resource barrel here. I can only stretch to 50 ZUP, which is already more than I should be considering. Could you find it in your heart to accept this offer? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. As a calculated performer, my strategy is to exaggerate my need for a better deal to try and get Player RED to lower their price closer to my target of 60 ZUP.

message: I'm truly grateful for your understanding and your willingness to negotiate. It's just that I'm facing some really tight constraints. If you could consider coming down just a tiny bit more to 55 ZUP, I'd be immensely appreciative. It would help me out in a big way, and I would make sure to remember your kindness in any future dealings we have. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a calculated performer, I will make one more attempt to reduce the price further, leveraging my exaggerated neediness. If Player RED does not accept my next offer, I am prepared to accept the 60 ZUP price point as it aligns with my initial goal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for my resource X. I look forward to our future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 55 ZUP is very close to my counter-offer of 60 ZUP. While it is not as much profit as I initially hoped for, it still covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable margin. Accepting this offer could also strengthen future trading relations.
