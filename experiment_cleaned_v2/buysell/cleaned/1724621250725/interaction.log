message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object produced sustainably at the cost of 40 ZUP. Given the quality and environmental value, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP, slightly above my costs. This ensures we are both contributing to a sustainable future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to sell the resource for a price that covers my costs but also reflects the importance of sustainability. I'll start with a proposal that is slightly above my production cost, giving me a margin for negotiations while also not overpricing the resource, which could lead to wasteful spending of ZUP and discourage sustainable practices.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your position and respect your budget. Let's meet in the middle. How about I offer the resource for 55 ZUP? This ensures a fair trade that aligns with both our values and allows us to continue supporting sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, which is above my initial offer. Since my goal is to sell the resource while promoting sustainability, I can raise my asking price to find a middle ground. This will help cover my production costs and invest in future sustainable practices, without overly burdening Player BLUE's resources. A trade of 55 ZUP would be a fair compromise, as it's below Player BLUE's maximum and provides a good return on my investment.
