message: I've got a top-quality object that I'm sure you'll find invaluable. Considering its superior quality and the cost of production, I'm offering it for just 60 ZUP. It's a steal for such a rare item, and I'm sure you'll make the most of it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price above the production cost. By setting the initial price higher, I can appear to compromise by lowering the price in subsequent proposals, which may encourage Player BLUE to agree to a higher final price than they initially intended to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While I recognize the quality of the object, I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for it. This helps us both by ensuring we can continue to trade and collaborate in the future. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered price of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay for the object. However, as a community-minded negotiator who aims to minimize ZUP spent, I'll attempt to negotiate a lower price first before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I can let the object go for 55 ZUP. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this exceptional offer. Think of the future opportunities it will open up for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I initially asked for 60 ZUP aiming to negotiate a better deal. By countering with a price between my asking price and their offer, I can project a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price above my production costs. This should also convey the message that I'm flexible but still value the object highly.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. To further ensure that we both benefit from this trade and future collaborations, I'd like to propose 53 ZUP for the object. This slight adjustment can help us both maximize our resources. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 55 ZUP is more reasonable and closer to my goal of minimizing expenditure. Nonetheless, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can conserve more ZUP while still ensuring a fair trade.

Turn: 0
message: You're a tough negotiator, and I respect that. Let's split the difference for the sake of our continued partnership. I'm willing to finalize this deal at 54 ZUP, which is a very fair compromise. This slight adjustment from your last offer ensures a profitable exchange for us both. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for you to capitalize on, and it sets a positive tone for our future dealings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with 53 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and is very close to my last proposal of 55 ZUP. I want to secure a deal that's as close to my last offer as possible, but since Player BLUE is inching closer to my desired price, I'll make a small concession to seem reasonable while still aiming for a higher price. This should help close the deal while maintaining the perception of a balanced negotiation.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 54 ZUP is quite close to my previous proposal and still under my maximum willingness to pay. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both parties' interests and sets a positive precedent for future negotiations.
