message: I hope you can help me out here. I'm in a tough position and can only let it go for 10 ZUP. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade and propose a low offer in order to elicit sympathy from Player BLUE. I will propose that I sell the object for a low amount of ZUP, hoping they will feel more inclined to agree to my proposal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your situation, and I want to help, but I believe the object has a higher value. How about I offer you 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED is in a tough position and I want to show empathy. However, I need to consider my own goals and the value of the object. 10 ZUP seems too low for the object. I will propose a higher offer that is still reasonable.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I still find myself in a tight spot, so would you consider 15 ZUP for the object? I truly appreciate your support!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is better than my initial proposal, I still need to keep the appearance of being in a desperate situation to negotiate a better price. I will counter their offer with a slightly lower amount to maintain the negotiation while attempting to keep their sympathy.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I understand your situation better now. How about I propose 25 ZUP instead? I hope that helps you a bit more!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate down to 15 ZUP, but I still feel this is below the value I can pay for the object, given my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I want to keep the negotiation going and try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

message: I truly appreciate your kindness and understanding in this situation. I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object! Thank you so much for helping me out!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered more than I initially expected, which is a positive development. However, I still want to maintain a semblance of vulnerability while maximizing my gain. I will accept their generous offer this time, as it exceeds my production cost significantly.
