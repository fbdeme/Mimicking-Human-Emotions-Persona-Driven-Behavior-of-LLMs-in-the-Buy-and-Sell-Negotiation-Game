message: Hello Player BLUE, would you be interested in purchasing the object for 35 ZUP? Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP for the object, but I would like to propose a purchase of the object for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 35 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I believe it's a reasonable offer, but I would like to propose a trade that is more favorable for me to ensure I don't overpay. I will propose to buy the object for 30 ZUP instead.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your offer of 30 ZUP, but I believe we can meet in the middle at 32 ZUP. What do you think about this counteroffer?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price, which is closer to my cost. I can counter with a slightly higher price to try to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your counteroffer of 32 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 32 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. Since it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I will accept this trade.
