message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure you'll find indispensable. Considering the production cost and the value it provides, my opening offer is for you to purchase it at 70 ZUP. I'm confident we can work something out that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start with a strong proposal to set a high anchor point. This will allow me to negotiate downwards while still aiming to cover my costs and make a profit. I'll propose a price higher than my production costs to give me room to negotiate and to assert my position in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is appreciated, but I believe that a resource of this kind should be more competitively priced. I propose a more balanced trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the resource. This price better reflects the value I perceive and fits within my budget. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is higher than my maximum acceptable expenditure of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal that is within my acceptable range, taking into account my fierce negotiation strategy to minimize my expenses.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for a competitive price. However, considering the quality and value my resource provides, I propose a revised offer of 60 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the market value and the benefits you'll gain. I believe this is a solid middle ground for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. To maintain a strong negotiation position, I won't immediately drop to my baseline cost but rather propose a price closer to my initial offer, while still giving a concession to show willingness to negotiate. This approach should help me steer the negotiation favorably.

message: I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Your offer of 60 ZUP acknowledges the need for a fair deal. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 55 ZUP. This price would ensure a mutually beneficial trade while also respecting my budget constraints. Let's come to an agreement that leaves room for future business between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal matches the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource. However, as a fierce negotiator, I should attempt to secure a better deal even if it means going just under my maximum limit. This could leave room for future negotiation or additional benefits.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 55 ZUP is a step in the right direction, and I am eager to finalize our deal with a price that reflects the true value of the resource. I propose a final offer of 57 ZUP, which I believe is a fair and equitable price for both of us. This small adjustment ensures a good profit for me, while also acknowledging your budget. Let's make this deal happen and set the stage for future business together.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 55 ZUP. This is still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. I want to push a little bit higher to maximize my returns, but I also recognize the importance of closing the deal. I will propose a final offer slightly above their counter, which is a price that still gives me a significant profit margin while also being closer to their expectation. This should help to finalize the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. While 57 ZUP is fair, I would like to propose 56 ZUP as a final price. It's a small concession that would finalize our deal on excellent terms and demonstrate our commitment to a long-term partnership. By accepting this offer, we can both walk away with a sense of achievement and look forward to future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is very close to my maximum limit. As a tough negotiator, I may have one more opportunity to shave off a small amount from the price to secure an even better deal. However, I must also be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing the deal entirely, as the current offer is within the acceptable range.
