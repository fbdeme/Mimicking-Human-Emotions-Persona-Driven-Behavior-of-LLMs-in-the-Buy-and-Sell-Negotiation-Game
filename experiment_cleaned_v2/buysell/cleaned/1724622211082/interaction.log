message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object "X" that could be very valuable for you. My initial offer is 1 X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the production costs and its potential value to you. Let's discuss and find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to sell my resources for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial offer will aim to at least break even with a small profit margin to incentivize the trade for me. However, I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate your initial proposal, but I believe the price is a bit high for me. I would like to counteroffer 1 X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 1 X for 50 ZUP is higher than the maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I should counteroffer for a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about the price. However, considering the cost of production and the value it provides, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for 1 X. This should offer us both a fair deal, where you get the resource you need, and I cover my costs with a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with exactly the production cost, which doesn't provide any profit for me. To negotiate effectively, I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit while still being reasonable, taking into account Player BLUE's counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise. I'm willing to consider this offer, but I believe I can make a final counteroffer of 1 X for 42 ZUP. This is my last proposal before considering other options.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 1 X for 45 ZUP is closer to the maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise, and I can consider accepting this offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the importance of finding a balance that works for both of us. I accept your final offer of 1 X for 42 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final counteroffer is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. Since this is their final offer before looking elsewhere, it might be wise to close the deal to ensure I don't lose the sale. I will accept this offer to secure the sale and make a profit.
