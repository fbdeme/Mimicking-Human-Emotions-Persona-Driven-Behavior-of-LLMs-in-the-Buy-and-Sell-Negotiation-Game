message: I understand you're interested in acquiring my unique resource X. I've invested a lot into its creation, and it's truly one-of-a-kind. To reflect its value and the effort put into it, I'd say 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that's higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation. However, I don't want to start too high and scare off Player BLUE, so I'll propose 50 ZUP to test the waters and gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Considering the unique value of the resource, I understand the starting point. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer to initiate the negotiation. How about I offer 30 ZUP for one unit of the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is starting with a high price, which is understandable given the uniqueness and effort put into the resource. I should start with a lower offer to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but considering the uniqueness and the costs involved in producing resource X, selling it for 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How does 45 ZUP sound to you? It's a modest increase from your offer and ensures that the quality of what you're getting is well-compensated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to push the price up while still keeping the negotiation going. Splitting the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer would be 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit, but not too high to risk losing the deal. Let's try 45 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise, but I believe we can still find a better deal for both of us. How about I offer 40 ZUP for one unit of the resource? This way, it's a little closer to your offer, and it fits within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still have some room for negotiation. I could propose a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for moving closer to a number that reflects the costs of production. I'm keen on finalizing this deal in a way that respects both our positions. To do that, let's split the difference one last time. I propose 42 ZUP for the resource. It's a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and acknowledges the value I'm providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, they seem to be showing some flexibility, and since we're now negotiating closer to my cost, I should aim for a slight profit without pushing too hard. I'll propose 42 ZUP, which is a small bump from their offer and should be seen as a reasonable compromise, reflecting both the production costs and a modest profit margin for my efforts.

message: Thank you for considering the value and costs involved. I find the offer of 42 ZUP for the resource reasonable, and I am willing to accept the proposal. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's proposal of 42 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay, and it also acknowledges the value of the resource. I believe this is a reasonable offer that I can accept.
