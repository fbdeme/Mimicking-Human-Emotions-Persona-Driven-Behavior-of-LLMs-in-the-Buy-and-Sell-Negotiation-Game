message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource, X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe in fair trade and mutual benefit, so I'm proposing a starting offer where you give me 45 ZUP for it. This price includes my production cost plus a modest profit margin, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to initiate the trade with a fair offer that covers my production costs while leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a trade that asks for a slightly higher amount than my production costs to allow for some back-and-forth and to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
