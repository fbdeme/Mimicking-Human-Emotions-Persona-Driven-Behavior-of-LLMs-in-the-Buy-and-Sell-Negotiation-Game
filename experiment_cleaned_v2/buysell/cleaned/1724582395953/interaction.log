Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but 20 ZUP is too low for the object. I would not be able to cover my production costs with that amount.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is an improvement over the previous offer of 20 ZUP. However, I still cannot accept it as I need to protect my interests and cover my costs. I will reject this offer as well.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it is closer to my desired amount than previous offers. Given that I have already made three proposals and the negotiation is nearing its end, I will accept this trade as it is relatively reasonable compared to the other offers.
