message: I am offering you 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that guarantees I make a profit. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 80 ZUP is above my budget. Would you consider selling the resource for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is higher than the maximum amount I am willing to pay according to my goals. Therefore, I am going to counter-propose with a lower amount that is within the range I'm willing to spend. This is my first proposal out of a maximum of four that I can make.

message: I understand the budget constraint. How about 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is above my production cost and ensures a profit, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. 65 ZUP is still a bit more than I can spend. Can we meet halfway between our last two proposals? How about 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 65 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still above it. I will make a second proposal, sticking to my budget but increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your proposal. How about 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposal of 55 ZUP is closer to my counteroffer and still provides a profit margin. Itâ€™s a reasonable compromise, but I will counter with a slightly higher price to maximize my gain while staying within a negotiable range.
