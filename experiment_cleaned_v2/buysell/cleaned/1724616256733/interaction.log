message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be very beneficial to you. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP. Let's work out a deal that's profitable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a starting proposal, I aim to set a price higher than my production costs to ensure a profit, but not too high to dissuade Player BLUE from negotiating. A higher initial offer gives me room to adjust the price through negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for the high-quality resource. Would you consider accepting 40 ZUP instead? I believe this could still be a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is within my budget of 60 ZUP, and the value of the resource seems beneficial. However, I want to negotiate slightly to see if I can secure a better deal. I'll propose a lower amount first and gauge the response.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but considering the costs and the effort put into obtaining this resource, I would like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This would give us both the opportunity to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay the exact production cost, which does not provide me with any profit. I would like to counter with a slightly higher offer to ensure a profit margin. It's a compromise between the initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer.
