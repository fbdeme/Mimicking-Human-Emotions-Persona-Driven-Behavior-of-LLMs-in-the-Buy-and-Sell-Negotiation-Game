message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade for 50 ZUP to open negotiations. Let's work together to come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs while also providing an opportunity for negotiation. I'll start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer of 50 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the object X to better accommodate our resources. Letâ€™s find a fair agreement that works for us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable as it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and it allows me to acquire the object X. However, I believe we can negotiate for a lower price to ensure we both benefit from the trade. I will propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand the need to make the trade fair for both of us. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give us both a reasonable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production costs, which is a good starting point. However, I'll propose a trade that splits the difference between my initial ask and their counter-offer to come to a mutually beneficial agreement while covering my costs and allowing for a small profit.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair deal that benefits us both, and I look forward to completing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 47 ZUP is a fair compromise between our initial offers. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and it ensures that the seller covers their production costs. I feel this trade is beneficial for both parties. I will accept this trade.
