message: I am offering you my object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the resources I invested in producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that maximizes my profit while minimizing the amount of ZUP I need to receive. Since I have one object X to sell, Iâ€™ll start by proposing a trade that reflects its value to me, which is higher than my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, but I believe we can reach a better deal. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for your object X. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic negotiator, my goal is to acquire the object X for less than the maximum to conserve resources. Thus, I will propose a lower amount to open negotiations and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your trade of my object X for 45 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to our future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, it is still a profit for me since it exceeds my production cost. I will accept this trade as it allows me to gain ZUP while also moving the single object I have.
