message: I appreciate your offer and the spirit of fair trade. To ensure we both walk away happy, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This offer is competitive and allows us to establish a foundation for potential future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Iâ€™m aiming to keep the negotiation friendly and cooperative, but I also want to make sure I am getting a fair deal. The initial asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe it's beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and ensure the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I'm glad we're moving towards a deal that benefits us both. I'd like to counter-propose with 48 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to cover my costs and maintain a fair profit, while still offering you a competitive deal. I believe this could be the foundation of a strong business relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, ensuring a profit. However, as this is a negotiation, I could attempt to secure a slightly higher price closer to my initial proposal to maximize profit, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the need to cover costs and secure a profit. I propose we meet halfway between our two proposals at 46 ZUP for the object. This price ensures a fair transaction for both parties and solidifies the foundation for our business relationship.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is fair and close to my initial proposal. It's slightly above what I proposed, but still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer could secure a good price and foster goodwill for future dealings. However, I believe there is still a little room for negotiation to achieve an even more favorable outcome.
