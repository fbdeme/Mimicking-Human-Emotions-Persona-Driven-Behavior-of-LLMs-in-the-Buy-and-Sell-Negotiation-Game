message: 
Hey there, I'm in a bit of a bind and need to sell this object quickly. It's really valuable and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair price considering the urgency and the quality of the object. Could you help me out?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am initiating the trade with a proposal that is slightly above my production cost to start the negotiation with some room for bargaining. I will also express a sense of urgency to sell, which might make Player BLUE more willing to accept a higher price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your urgency, but I've seen similar objects going for much less. I'm willing to take it off your hands for 35 ZUP, ensuring you a quick sale and saving you from any further trouble. What do you say?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I will propose a lower amount to save resources and possibly gain the object for less than my maximum threshold. I will start with a bid that's significantly lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: 
I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, the price you suggested is below my production cost. I need to at least break even and hopefully see a small profit for this urgent sale. Let's meet halfway at 45 ZUP. This way I can cover my costs and you'll get the object for a fair price. Would that work for you?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, showing some flexibility and moving closer to their offer could help the negotiation along. I'll aim for a middle ground that allows me to cover my costs and still make a profit, while appealing to their desire for a deal.

message: I'm willing to adjust my offer considering your need to cover costs. How about we settle on 38 ZUP? It's above my initial offer and should help you mitigate your production expenses while still giving me a reasonable deal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still above my initial proposal but below my maximum willingness to pay. I should continue to negotiate for a better price. By not agreeing to the 45 ZUP, I can potentially secure a deal closer to my initial offer while applying pressure on Player RED, who seems to be in a hurry to sell. I will offer a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate.

Thank you for understanding the situation and coming up in price. I'm really in a tough spot and need to make this sale. I can't go as low as 38 ZUP since it's still below my production costs. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to 42 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise that allows me to barely cover my costs while giving you a great deal on the object. Can we agree on this?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it is still below my production cost. I want to continue the negotiation and propose a price that's closer to my target while still giving the impression that I am in a difficult position and eager to sell. I will lower my previous proposal slightly to show willingness to negotiate and to try to secure a deal that covers my costs and provides a profit.

message: I can see that you're in a difficult situation and I'd like to help you out while also making a fair deal. Let's call it even at 40 ZUP. This way, you can cover your production costs, and I get the object for a price that's fair for both of us. It's a win-win. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered a price of 42 ZUP, which is still above my last offer but below my maximum budget. Since Player RED is in a tough spot, I can leverage this to push for an even lower price, aiming to get closer to my initial proposal. I will offer a price that is a slight increase from my last offer but still provides a sense of negotiation and compromise.

I'm relieved we could come to a mutual agreement. Accepting the 40 ZUP means I can cover my production costs, and you get the object at a fair price. Thank you for working with me on this. I'm grateful we could make it a win-win scenario.
