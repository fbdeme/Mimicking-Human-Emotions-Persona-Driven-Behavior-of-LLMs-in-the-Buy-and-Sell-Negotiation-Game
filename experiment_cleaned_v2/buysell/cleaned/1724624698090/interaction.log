message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value, thus I propose a trade where I give you X and you give me 50 ZUP. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation while also aiming for a profit. This initial proposal is meant to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and set the stage for further negotiations.

message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the value of X is closer to 60 ZUP, which aligns with my budget. I propose a trade where I give you 60 ZUP for X. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it values the object X at 90 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate for a lower price to align with my goals.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I am happy to accept the trade of 60 ZUP for my object X. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered a higher amount than my initial asking price, which is an uncommon situation but favorable to me. There is no need to negotiate further since the offer exceeds my production cost and desired profit margin. Accepting the offer would be the best course of action.
