message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose to trade my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price considers the production cost of 40 ZUP and ensures a fair trade for both of us. I am open to your thoughts and willing to negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since I aim to recoup the production costs of the resource, which are 40 ZUP, my initial proposal will be set at a slightly higher rate to leave room for negotiation, keeping in mind the greater good and the possibility of reaching an amicable agreement.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your fair starting offer. To ensure we both walk away positively from this trade, I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for your resource X. This price is above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit, while also saving some of my resources for other potential good deeds. I hope you find this proposal agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 50 ZUP for resource X is within my goals of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, as a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I should attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve more of my resources for future opportunities that might benefit others. A counterproposal slightly lower than 50 ZUP, but still above RED's production cost, should be fair.

message: Thank you for your considerate counter-offer, Player BLUE. In the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit, I propose we meet halfway between our initial offers. I suggest 47 ZUP for resource X, which is a compromise that still allows you to save resources for other good causes while ensuring a modest profit for the production cost I incurred. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared goal of creating the greatest good for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is above my production costs, which aligns with my goal of recovering the production cost and making a profit. However, I am inclined to propose a trade that meets halfway between our initial proposals, as this would ensure a better outcome for both of us, considering my selfless approach.
