message: I propose to sell X for 60 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, which was 40 ZUP. Let's work together to find a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that is slightly higher than my production cost to give room for negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose 60 ZUP as a starting point. This gives us room to adjust and find a mutually beneficial price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but as a starting point, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for X. This allows us some room for discussion and ensures we both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial proposal by Player RED is for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's better to propose a lower price to start negotiations. Making a lower offer will give me room to negotiate and potentially secure the resources for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is close to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I'd like to aim for a slightly higher price to account for potential profit. I will propose 55 ZUP to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a great idea! However, I'd like to propose 53 ZUP for the object. It's just slightly less than your offer and could represent significant savings for my budget, while still giving you a fair price above your production costs.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I want to spend the least ZUP possible, I should counter with a slightly lower offer to further negotiate the price down, while keeping the final price within my acceptable range. This is my second proposal, so I still have room for two more proposals after this one.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal of 53 ZUP. I accept your offer. Thank you for collaborating to find a fair deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very reasonable and close to my counteroffer of 55 ZUP. Accepting this will ensure a fair profit above my production cost, while also respecting the buyer's budget. This seems like a mutually beneficial deal.
