message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in acquiring the object X. Given the spirit of cooperation and fair trade, would you consider a trade where Player RED Gives X: 1 for 35 ZUP? Looking forward to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered the object X for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, my aim is to foster cooperation and possibly reduce the ZUP expenditure even further. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation while keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X, but I cannot accept that amount as it does not cover my production cost. I am still willing to sell X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 35 ZUP, I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will reject the offer and propose my original price to ensure I do not incur a loss.

message: Thank you for your response. I understand the importance of covering your production costs. I'm happy to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X, ensuring a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 35 ZUP, stating it does not cover their production costs, and they are holding firm at 40 ZUP. Since the price is within my willing-to-pay limit and RED is not moving on their price, it makes sense to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without further delay, while still staying within my set goals.
