message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I believe would be valuable to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing it, and I'm looking to sell it for a small profit. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my costs and offers you a fair deal for my product. Let's work together to make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that covers my costs and gives me a small profit, which would be an encouraging starting point for negotiations. The initial offer should not be too high to scare off Player BLUE, but it should also reflect the value of the resource I'm offering.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the quality of Resource X and your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that reflects my budget constraints. How about I give you 45 ZUP for 1 X? It's above your production cost and would still offer you a profit, while also saving me some resources for future investments. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is to trade at a rate of 50 ZUP for 1 X. This is below the maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's generally good practice to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal. Proposing a counteroffer slightly lower than 50 ZUP but still above Player RED's cost of production (40 ZUP) could lead to a fair compromise for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of my position and your willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. To meet halfway and respect your budgetary needs while also ensuring a fair profit for my investment, I propose a revised trade of 1 X for 47 ZUP. I believe this strikes a fair balance for both of us, allowing you to save resources for future investments while providing me with a modest return on my product. Let's continue to work together towards a successful partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and understand their budget constraints. However, I would still like to secure a slightly higher profit margin. I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial proposals, which should be agreeable and still provide me with a reasonable profit while respecting Player BLUE's budget.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, Player RED. Your revised offer of 47 ZUP is generous, but I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for 1 X. This offer is close to your last and would allow us both to conserve resources for future transactions. I believe this trade would be fair to both parties, reflecting both the value of the resource and our respective financial considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP for 1 X. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but as negotiations typically involve some back-and-forth, a further counteroffer that is slightly higher than my last but still below RED's latest may lead to a final agreement that's beneficial for both sides. By inching closer to RED's proposal, I show willingness to compromise while still aiming for the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 X is acceptable, and I'm pleased that we've been able to come to an agreement that is fair to both of us. This trade allows us to both conserve resources for the future while still achieving our current goals. I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal and the possibility of future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is reasonable and only 1 ZUP short of my last proposal. Considering our negotiation progress and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for potential future deals, I am inclined to accept this offer. This agreement would still give me a profit above my production cost, and it is important to conclude the trade on good terms.
