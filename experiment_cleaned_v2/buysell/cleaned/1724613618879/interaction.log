message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's quite valuable and would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. I'm open to discussion and want to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an initial offer, I want to set a price that gives me a profit while still being open to negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but considering my budget and the market, I can only offer you 40 ZUP for the resource. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is higher than my willingness to pay. Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, while I am only willing to pay 60 ZUP at most. I can negotiate down to secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, but I'm also looking to make a small profit from this transaction. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals and settle on 45 ZUP for the resource? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, but it does not provide any profit. Since teamwork and collaboration are important, I will counter with a slightly higher offer that allows for a small profit and leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can still only commit to 40 ZUP for the resource. I hope you can consider this final offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED is making a reasonable counter-offer at 45 ZUP, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to reduce the price.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your firm stance and understand your position. I agree to your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with this deal, and I look forward to future opportunities to work together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is firm on their offer of 40 ZUP. Since my goal is to establish a collaborative relationship and make a sale, I will accept their offer. It covers my production costs, and while it doesn't provide a profit, it does allow for the possibility of future transactions where we can both benefit.
