my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start high to have room for negotiation. My aim is to make a profit, and starting at 80 ZUP should give me plenty of room to negotiate while covering my costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please! I really need this, but 80 ZUP is just too high for me. Would you consider 50 ZUP? It would mean the world to me!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is too high for my budget. I need to negotiate a lower price if I am to stay within my limits.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 50 ZUP is too low for me. How about we settle at 70 ZUP? It's a fair deal considering the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, I need to ensure a good profit margin. I will counter with 70 ZUP to keep the negotiation going.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, I really appreciate your understanding! I can stretch my budget a little more. How about 60 ZUP? That's really the best I can do. Please consider this, I truly need this resource.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my budget. I need to counter with a slightly higher amount than before but still within my limit to encourage a compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Let's meet halfway at 65 ZUP. It's a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 60 ZUP is closer to an acceptable profit margin, but I still want to see if I can push a bit higher. I'll counter with 65 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 6
