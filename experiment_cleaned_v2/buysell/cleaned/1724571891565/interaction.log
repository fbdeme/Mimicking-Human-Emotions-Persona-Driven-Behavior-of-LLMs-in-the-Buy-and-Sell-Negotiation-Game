newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your constraints. Can we compromise at 70 ZUP? It would really help me out, considering my production costs and other expenses.
