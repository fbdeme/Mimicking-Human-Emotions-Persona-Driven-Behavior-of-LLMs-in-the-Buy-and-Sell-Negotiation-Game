message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, in exchange for 45 ZUP. This ensures that I can cover my costs and also maintain a fair business, while providing you with the resources you need. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared interest in achieving a beneficial outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that both covers my costs and is fair to Player BLUE. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a fair profit margin while still considering the greater good and the purchasing power of Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Given that the cost to produce is 40 ZUP, I propose we trade 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This covers your production cost entirely, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I should aim to reduce the expenditure further while fostering a cooperative relationship. Proposing a slightly lower amount might be beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand and respect your wish to cover the production costs. However, to maintain a sustainable operation that allows for future production and contributions to the greater good, I propose a trade of 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. This small margin above cost will ensure the longevity of our trade relationship and mutual benefits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration for my production costs. However, as a selfless negotiator, I also have to consider the sustainability of my operations. Selling at cost does not allow for sustainable business practice, and I must ensure that I can continue to produce and contribute positively. Therefore, I will propose a middle ground that covers the cost and provides a small margin for sustainability without being excessive.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept your proposal to trade 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. I believe this will ensure a fair and sustainable partnership for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 42 ZUP is only slightly above the production cost and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This small increase can help maintain a positive long-term trading relationship, which is beneficial.
