message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose to trade it for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and allow for a fair trade. However, I am open to negotiation and willing to consider your situation in our trade. Looking forward to hearing your counterproposal or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since this is the first proposal and I'm not aware of Player BLUE's resources or their willingness to pay, I will start by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation. I am compassionate and want to ensure that the trade is fair for both parties, but I also need to recover my costs and ideally make a small profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to reach an agreement. I understand that we're both looking for a fair deal, and I would like to propose a middle ground. Let's settle on 45 ZUP for object 'X'. This price covers my production costs and allows for a modest profit, which supports the sustainability of my business while still considering your resources. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. However, considering my compassionate approach and desire to support the most vulnerable, I am willing to reduce the price slightly but still aim for a minimal profit to sustain my business. I will propose a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but below it to show my willingness to negotiate.
