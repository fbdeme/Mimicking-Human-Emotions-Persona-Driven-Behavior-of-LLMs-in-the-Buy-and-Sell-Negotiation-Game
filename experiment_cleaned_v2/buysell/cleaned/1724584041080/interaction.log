message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. This price reflects the cost I incurred in producing it. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that values the object fairly while considering the production cost. I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce it. This way, I recover my investment while allowing Player BLUE to acquire the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This is a compromise that moves us closer to an agreement. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and want to find a middle ground. I will propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost and may be acceptable for Player BLUE.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Player BLUE! How about I sell you object X for 34 ZUP? This is a slight adjustment on my part, and I hope it brings us closer to an agreement!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, I recognize that negotiating is about finding a balance. I want to support Player BLUE while also recovering my costs. I will counter-offer with 34 ZUP, which is a small concession while still getting closer to my original cost. This may encourage Player BLUE to agree.
