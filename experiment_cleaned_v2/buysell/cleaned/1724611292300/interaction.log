message: I have a high-quality object X that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. Considering the production costs and its unmatched quality, I'm offering it for 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it. Since I want to spend the least ZUP and make a profit, I will start by proposing a trade that is higher than my production cost to see if Player BLUE accepts or if they want to negotiate. I aim to get a sense of Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP for the high-quality object X is acceptable to me. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my budget and seems reasonable considering the description of its high quality and production costs. It's a fair deal that maximizes value for me while staying under my maximum willingness to pay.
