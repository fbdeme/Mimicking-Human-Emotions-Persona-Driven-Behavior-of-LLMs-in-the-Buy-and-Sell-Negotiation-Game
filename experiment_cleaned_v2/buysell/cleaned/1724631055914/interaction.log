message: Dear esteemed Player BLUE, I understand you're interested in acquiring the exceptional resource X. Given its rarity and the significant effort put into its production, I propose a fair exchange of 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. I'm sure you'll find the quality justifies the price. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, knowing that I can gradually decrease the price to still ensure a profit while attempting to make the opponent believe they are getting a better deal through negotiation. By starting at 60 ZUP, I set a high anchor point, which might make subsequent lower offers seem more reasonable to Player BLUE, even if they are still above my cost of production.

I can appreciate the constraints you're facing, and in the spirit of cooperation, I am willing to come down to 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
