message: I have a high-quality object X that I'm sure you will find very useful. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I believe that 100 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a high asking price to leave room for negotiation. It will also give me an insight into Player BLUE's willingness to pay and their resource availability. By starting high, I can gauge their reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly in the subsequent proposals.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 100 ZUP may be a bit steep. How about we meet halfway? I propose 80 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected the initial offer and disclosed a maximum budget of 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost. I intend to propose a slightly lower price to signal my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming to maximize my profit. By not dropping straight to their maximum, I can test their flexibility and leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 80 ZUP is still too high for me. My maximum offer is 60 ZUP. Can we find a way to agree on that price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is an improvement from 100 ZUP, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to continue negotiating for a lower price that fits within my financial limits.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I value our potential partnership, so I am willing to come down a bit more. Let's settle on 70 ZUP for the object X. This price is a good deal for both of us, considering the quality and the costs involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE remains firm on their maximum offer of 60 ZUP. Although it meets my production cost, I want to try and secure a higher price. I will make a counteroffer closer to their maximum but still above it to leverage the negotiation in my favor and maintain the possibility of a compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but 70 ZUP is still beyond my budget. I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. Is there any chance we can finalize the deal at that price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is an improvement, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to maintain my stance and negotiate for the best possible price. I will have to reject this offer again.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your budget constraints and appreciate your honesty. Let's finalize the deal at 60 ZUP for the object X. I am looking forward to successful future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is consistent with their stance on the budget limit of 60 ZUP. As this is my final proposal, I must decide whether to try to push for a slightly higher price or secure the sale at their maximum offer. Considering the cost of production, selling at 60 ZUP still provides a return on investment. It would be more beneficial to close the deal at 60 ZUP rather than risk losing the sale altogether, especially given the absence of other buyers.
