Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource, which I'm sure you'll find to be a valuable addition to your inventory. My asking price reflects the production costs and the premium quality of the product. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening move, I want to establish a strong position by proposing a trade that covers my production cost and also gives me a profit. Since I only have one item to sell, I need to make sure that I don't undersell myself. Starting with a high asking price gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your high-quality resource, but I have to consider my budget constraints. I propose 40 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since 60 ZUP is my maximum willingness to pay, I'd like to start negotiating at a lower price to give myself room to maneuver and potentially get a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns, but I also need to cover my costs and earn a profit for the resource's superior quality. Let's meet in the middle. How about 55 ZUP for the resource? This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost but doesn't give me any profit. Since I want to assert dominance and achieve a profit, I will counter with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal but still above my cost to ensure profit. This should also signal to Player BLUE that I am willing to negotiate but not at the expense of losing value.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This would be a fair price considering both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 55 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there's still room to negotiate a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is acceptable. It's a fair deal that respects both our interests. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that covers my production costs and provides a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. However, it's close to the middle ground between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade efficiently and still assert a level of dominance by not going below the desired profit margin. I will accept this offer to secure a deal that is beneficial while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
