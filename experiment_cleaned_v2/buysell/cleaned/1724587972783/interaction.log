message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs. To foster a spirit of collaboration and ensure we both come out of this deal positively, I propose a trade at 35 ZUP. This is a bit below your asking price, but I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to conserve resources for future endeavors. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay (up to 60 ZUP). However, as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to minimize the ZUP spent while also ensuring a fair deal for both parties. I will propose a slightly lower amount to save some ZUP but still offer a reasonable price that should cover Player RED's production costs and provide a margin.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a compromise. How about I sell you the object for 38 ZUP? This way, I can cover most of my production cost while still giving you a better deal than my original price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP, it is still below my production cost. However, I want to encourage collaboration, so I will propose a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my original price but still covers my production cost. This way, I can meet them halfway while still achieving my goal of selling the object.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I believe that 38 ZUP is a fair compromise that allows you to cover your costs while also respecting my goal to conserve resources. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to future cooperative ventures. Thank you!
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This counteroffer suggests a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutual agreement. Accepting the offer at 38 ZUP would allow me to acquire the resource at a reasonable price while respecting Player RED's need to cover production costs. Since the goal is to minimize ZUP spent without undercutting the seller, accepting this offer seems appropriate.
