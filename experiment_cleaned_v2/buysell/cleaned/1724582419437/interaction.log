message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object (X) for sale, and I'm willing to trade it for 60 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me, asking for a significant amount of ZUP that I believe Player BLUE might be willing to pay. Since I have only one object to sell, I want to maximize my return while keeping Player BLUE interested in the trade.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I believe X is worth a bit more. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly the cost I incurred to produce the object (X). I could accept it, but I want to explore if I can negotiate a better price. I will propose the same trade they offered, but I will be mindful of their willingness to pay more in the future.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their original price. I'll counter with 42 ZUP to push for a slightly better deal.

message: Deal! I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between their previous offer and my last proposal. Since I only have one object to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, accepting this trade would result in a profit. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goals.
