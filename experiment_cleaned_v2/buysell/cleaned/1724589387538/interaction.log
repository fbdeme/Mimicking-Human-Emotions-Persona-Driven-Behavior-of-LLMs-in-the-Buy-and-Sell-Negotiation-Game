message: I am offering to sell you the object for 30 ZUP. This way, we both benefit, and it allows me to conserve resources for future needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the object and my goal of minimizing ZUP spending. I propose to sell the object for a smaller amount of ZUP to encourage a deal while still covering production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I would like to propose a trade of 20 ZUP for the resource. This ensures a fair transaction and allows us to both maintain resources for other opportunities.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 30 ZUP is within my budget, as a fierce negotiator, I want to propose a lower amount to save resources and maximize my benefit. Starting with a lower offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching an even more favorable agreement.

message: I understand your position, but I would like to propose selling the object for 35 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that allows me to recover closer to the production cost while still being considerate of resource conservation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we settle on 25 ZUP for the object? This price allows for a fair distribution of expenses and benefits for both of us, taking into account production costs and resource management.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room to negotiate a better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, aiming to meet in the middle while still keeping the cost lower than the seller's last proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I would like to propose a final offer of 32 ZUP for the object. This amount allows me to recover a significant portion of my production costs while still being a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Your offer of 25 ZUP is an improvement over previous proposals, but it still does not cover my production costs. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but I need to ensure that the trade meets my financial needs. I will make a final counter-offer that is slightly lower than my previous proposal while still aiming to cover costs.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer is noted and appreciated. I propose we settle on 28 ZUP for the object. This amount strikes a balance between your need to cover costs and my goal of conserving resources. I believe this to be a fair and equitable arrangement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is nearing my maximum willingness to pay, but has not yet reached it. Therefore, I still have room for one more counteroffer to attempt to get the price down even further. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my previous offer, I aim to reach a final agreement that is below the seller's current asking price but still offers them a reasonable amount over my initial offer.
