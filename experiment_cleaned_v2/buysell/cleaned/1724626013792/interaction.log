player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and provides a small profit. This will allow me to continue producing and contribute to the common goal of prosperity. However, I should also consider the collective success and not set the price too high. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
