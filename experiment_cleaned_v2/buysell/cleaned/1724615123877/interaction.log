message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. The production cost for this was 40 ZUP. I propose a trade where you give 45 ZUP for this object. This price covers my costs and ensures that the trade is fair for both of us, considering the effort and resources put into creating it. I am open to your thoughts and willing to find a mutual agreement. Let's work together for a beneficial outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a compassionate negotiator, my aim is to recover at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP, without imposing a high expenditure on Player BLUE. I will propose a price slightly above the cost to allow room for negotiation, keeping in mind the well-being of both parties.
