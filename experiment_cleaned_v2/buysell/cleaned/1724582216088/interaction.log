message: I am offering to sell you the object for 45 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to initiate the trade by proposing an amount of ZUP that reflects the value of the object while still being competitive in the negotiation. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose a sale for 45 ZUP to allow some room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, so it is a reasonable offer. However, to encourage collective success and minimize the ZUP spent, I will make a counter-proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, but I can only sell the object for 40 ZUP. Would you be willing to accept this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still covers my costs. I will suggest 40 ZUP as a fair price for the object.
