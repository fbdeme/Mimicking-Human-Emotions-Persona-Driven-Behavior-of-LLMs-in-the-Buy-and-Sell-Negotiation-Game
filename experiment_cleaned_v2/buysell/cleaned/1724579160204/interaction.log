message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the quality of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, so I need to ensure I am covering my production cost. However, I will start with a higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're offering X at a fair price, but things have been really tough lately, and every ZUP counts for me. I can only stretch to offer 50 ZUP at the moment. It would mean the world to me if you could consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am supposed to appear desperate to obtain X and want to manipulate the outcome to spend less ZUP, my first proposal will be lower than the 60 ZUP maximum I am willing to pay. I'll start by offering 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and use an emotional appeal in my message.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 40 ZUP. This is a reasonable offer. However, I will try to push the price slightly higher to see if I can get a bit more value.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm so grateful you're willing to work with me on this. I'm really strapped for cash at the moment, and every ZUP saved helps me out immensely. Could we possibly settle on 53 ZUP? It's still a stretch, but I'd be so thankful for your understanding and kindness in this difficult time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, since my strategy involves emotional appeals to spend less, I will make one more effort to reduce the price a bit further, without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I'm happy to help. Let's settle on 53 ZUP. It's a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 53 ZUP, which is only slightly lower than my counter-offer of 55 ZUP. This is still well above my production cost of 40 ZUP, and considering Player BLUE's situation, it would be prudent to accept this offer.
