message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm offering my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price will help me cover my production costs and ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together for mutual benefit!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I at least break even on the sale of my resource, X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. However, since I am community-minded and believe in collective success, I will propose a price of 50 ZUP to ensure we both benefit fairly from the transaction.

message: Hey Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. How about 30 ZUP? Let's make this deal beneficial for both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer seems fair, my objective is to minimize the expenditure. I will counter with a significantly lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate downward.

message: Hey Player BLUE, I understand your concern about the price. How about 40 ZUP? This way, I can at least cover my production costs, and we both make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. To find a middle ground, I will propose 40 ZUP, which ensures I at least break even on the resource.

message: Hey Player RED, 40 ZUP is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still looking to keep costs down. How about 35 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 40 ZUP, which is a significant improvement. However, to ensure a better deal for myself, I will make another counter-proposal to see if they are willing to go even lower.

message: Hey Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 38 ZUP? This is very close to my production cost and should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is a fair attempt to meet in the middle, it still does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. For the sake of finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a final offer of 38 ZUP, which brings us closer to my cost while acknowledging Player BLUE's effort to minimize expenses.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
