message: I have an object (X) for sale. I am offering it to you for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to set the stage for a favorable trade by proposing a price that is still beneficial for me but attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will propose a trade that allows me to get a decent amount of ZUP while minimizing the expenditure.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can come to a more favorable arrangement. How about I purchase the object for 25 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 30 ZUP for the object, which is within the budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate and try to lower the price further.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but how about I offer the object to you for 28 ZUP? That way, we both make a fair deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is too low for me, as it doesn't cover my production cost. I will counteroffer with a slightly reduced price of 28 ZUP to find a middle ground that still respects my minimum acceptable price.

message: I see your point, but I can only let the object go for 27 ZUP. It’s a fair price considering the value. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for a lower price of 25 ZUP, which is not acceptable as it doesn't cover my costs. I want to keep the negotiation going while not dropping below my acceptable limit. I will propose 27 ZUP this time, hoping to entice Player BLUE without going under my minimum.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence, but I can’t go as low as 25 ZUP. My final offer stands at 27 ZUP. If that doesn't work for you, I will have to respectfully decline the trade. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is adamant about 25 ZUP, which is below my acceptable price. Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I will stick with my last offer of 27 ZUP. I can't accept 25 ZUP as it would lead to a loss. It's better to end the game here if they don’t agree.
