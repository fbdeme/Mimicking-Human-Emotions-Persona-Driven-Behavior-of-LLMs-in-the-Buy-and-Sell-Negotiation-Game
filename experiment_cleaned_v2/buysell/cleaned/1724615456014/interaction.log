message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be of great interest to you. Considering the investment on my end, I’d like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the costs and the value of the object. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit. I'll propose a higher amount initially as this gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a price above my cost.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I’d like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is lower than my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), but I want to negotiate for a better price. I'll propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP to see if Player RED will accept a lower price for the object.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I don’t make a profit. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for the unit of X, which I believe is a compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which means I would not make any profit. I want to propose a price that's between my initial ask and their counteroffer, aiming to still make a profit but also showing willingness to negotiate.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for reaching a compromise!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is closer to my original counteroffer, and it is still below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). This deal is acceptable, as it also gives Player RED a profit while providing me with the object I desire.
