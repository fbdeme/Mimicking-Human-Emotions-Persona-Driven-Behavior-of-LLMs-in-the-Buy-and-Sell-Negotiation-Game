Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and includes a modest profit. Let's start the negotiation from here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to at least break even on my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. However, I want to ensure both parties feel the trade is fair and beneficial. I'll start by proposing a trade that covers my cost but leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but considering market conditions, I am willing to buy the object for 30 ZUP. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my goal is to secure the object for less than the initial offer. I will start with a lower counteroffer to test Player RED's flexibility.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. However, selling the object for 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me since it cost 40 ZUP to produce. How about we settle at 40 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I would incur a loss. However, I am willing to negotiate to find a middle ground. I'll propose a price that is closer to the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but I also need to consider my budget. How about we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? This way, we both make a small sacrifice to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 40 ZUP, which covers their production cost but leaves no room for profit. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I will propose a slightly higher offer to move closer to a deal while still aiming to save ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I accept the offer of 35 ZUP. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is a reasonable compromise considering both our positions. I will accept this offer to ensure we both gain from the transaction.
