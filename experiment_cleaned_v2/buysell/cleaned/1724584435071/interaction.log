message: Thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a lower price of 40 ZUP. How does that sound?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest in object X, but I must decline your offer of 40 ZUP. I am looking for a higher price to cover my production costs. Let’s negotiate further!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting the trade at 40 ZUP would mean I am not recovering my production cost, as it exactly matches the cost. However, I don't want to end the negotiation just yet as I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I will reject this offer and propose a counter-offer instead.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. I would like to propose the original price of 50 ZUP for object X. Let’s see if we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the counteroffer of 40 ZUP was rejected, I will propose a new trade of 50 ZUP, which is the original asking price. This is still within my budget and may lead to an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding! I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for object X. Let’s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair price for object X, especially since it covers my production costs and provides a profit. Since the other player has reverted to my original price, I see no reason to reject this offer. I will accept this trade.
