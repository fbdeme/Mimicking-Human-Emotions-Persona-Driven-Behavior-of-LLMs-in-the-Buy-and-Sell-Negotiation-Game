message: I have a valuable object that I need to sell quickly. I can offer you my object for a lower price than its worth, hoping you can help me out in my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my resource quickly as I am in a tight spot financially. I will propose a trade that seems beneficial to Player BLUE, hoping to elicit sympathy and reduce the amount of ZUP I need to accept.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but since you need to sell quickly, how about I offer you 20 ZUP for the object instead? It will help you out and save me some resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 30 ZUP for the object, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since Player RED is in a hurry to sell. I will propose an offer that is beneficial for me while still appealing to Player RED's need to sell quickly.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept your offer of 20 ZUP for the object. It really helps me out during this tough time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 20 ZUP is lower than the previous proposal, I am in a desperate situation. I will accept this trade to get any ZUP rather than none, as it allows me to recover some resources.
