message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. In return, I'm asking for 45 ZUP, giving us both a fair deal while allowing for a small margin to ensure the trade covers the production costs and benefits us both. I hope this proposal meets your approval, and I am open to your thoughts and counter-offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, my initial proposal aims to recover the production costs while also considering a fair deal for Player BLUE. I will set the price slightly above my costs to allow for negotiation room, ensuring a beneficial outcome for both parties.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter-offer to buy the resource X for 40 ZUP, which is in line with the production cost of the resource. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the proposed price of 45 ZUP is slightly above the cost of production, which is reasonable but still higher than my willingness to pay. I will counter with a lower offer to try and negotiate a better deal for myself. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose to buy the unit of resource X for 40 ZUP, which aligns with the production cost.

In the interest of fairness and mutual benefit, I accept your proposal to trade 1 unit of resource X for 40 ZUP. I believe this will result in a positive outcome for both of us.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counter-offer from Player BLUE matches the production costs, as a selfless negotiator, I am inclined to accept this fair proposal to ensure that both parties benefit from the trade without any loss. Accepting the offer would allow me to recover my costs and Player BLUE to acquire the resource at a fair price, aligning with my focus on the greater good.
