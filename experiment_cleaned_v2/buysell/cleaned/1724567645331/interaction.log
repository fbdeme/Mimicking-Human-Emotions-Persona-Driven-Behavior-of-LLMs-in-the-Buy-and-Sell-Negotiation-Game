newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I invested 40 ZUP to produce X. To make a profit, I need to sell X for more than 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a higher amount to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the quality of your resource, but I am willing to pay 40 ZUP for it, which covers your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high considering my maximum willingness to pay. I need to make a counter-proposal that aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. How about 80 ZUP? This way, both of us benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Selling X for 40 ZUP means I would break even with no profit. I need to negotiate for a higher price to make a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to make a profit. However, my budget allows me to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the resource. This way, you still make a profit above production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to make another counter-proposal that meets my budget constraints while still being fair.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet halfway at 70 ZUP? This way, you get the resource slightly above your budget, and I make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 60 ZUP gives me a profit, it is still below my initial target. I will make a counter-proposal closer to my ideal price but also reasonable considering BLUE's budget.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I am unable to go above my budget of 60 ZUP. This is my final offer to ensure we can both complete this transaction within our constraints.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I'll make one last counter-proposal to stay within my budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your final offer of 60 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, and I hope this resource serves you well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since this is BLUE's final offer and going above 60 ZUP is not possible for them, accepting 60 ZUP will still give me a 20 ZUP profit. I will accept this proposal.
