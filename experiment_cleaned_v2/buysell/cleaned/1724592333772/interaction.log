message: I am offering you the object X for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that aims to sell the object X for ZUP while keeping it reasonable since I need to recover my production cost. I will start by proposing a price that is a fraction of my production cost to encourage negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept the trade. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting the offer would achieve my goal to buy the resources for less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. It would also quickly conclude the transaction to the satisfaction of both parties, sticking to the principle of the greater good by not engaging in unnecessary negotiation.
