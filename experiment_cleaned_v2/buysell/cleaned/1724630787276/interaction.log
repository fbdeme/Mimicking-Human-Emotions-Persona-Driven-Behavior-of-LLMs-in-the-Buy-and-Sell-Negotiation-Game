message: I have an object X of exquisite quality, which I'm offering for 45 ZUP. It's a fair price for its value, and I believe it will serve your needs excellently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially gain a profit. I will propose a trade with a price of 45 ZUP to see if Player BLUE values the object higher than its production cost. This initial proposal also serves as a test to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to spend and see how they value the resource.

message: I appreciate the offer for the object X, and I'm certainly interested in acquiring it for my collection. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP. I believe this reflects a more balanced exchange, considering the market value and my budget constraints. I'm eager to come to a fair agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for the object X. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to negotiate a better deal to save resources. An initial counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a good starting point for negotiations, as it leaves room for compromise while signaling my interest in the object.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. I want to work towards an agreement that's beneficial for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at 42 ZUP for object X. This price takes into account the craftsmanship and quality, ensuring you're getting excellent value for your collection.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground. I will propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, allowing for a small profit and showing willingness to negotiate, but still gives Player BLUE the impression that they are getting a better deal than my initial proposal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I value the craftsmanship and quality of object X and understand your pricing. I propose we settle at 38 ZUP, which is a step up from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal that is respectful of both the item's worth and my budget. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to meet in the middle at 42 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. This offer is within my budget and closer to the maximum I am willing to pay. However, there is still room for negotiation, and I believe a counteroffer of 38 ZUP could be a fair compromise. It's slightly above my initial proposal and may be seen as a reasonable concession towards reaching an agreement.

message: I'm glad to see we are moving in the right direction. I propose a final offer of 41 ZUP for object X. This price reflects the quality and the value of the object while allowing me to cover production costs and maintain a sustainable business. I believe this is a fair compromise that should meet our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The new proposal of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost, but Player BLUE has shown some flexibility. I want to close this deal with a small profit, so I will counter with a price that is just above my production cost, at 41 ZUP. This should signal my final move towards closing the deal, while also providing me with a minimal profit margin. It's a compromise that's closer to my production cost and could be acceptable to Player BLUE considering their interest in object X.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is 41 ZUP, which is still within my budget and only 1 ZUP higher than my last counteroffer. It shows a commitment to finalizing the deal and respecting the value of the object. Accepting this offer would allow me to save 19 ZUP from my original maximum willingness to pay, while also fostering good relations for potential future transactions.
