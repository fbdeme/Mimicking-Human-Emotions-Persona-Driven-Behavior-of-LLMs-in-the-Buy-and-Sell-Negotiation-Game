message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand the importance of mindful resource management and wish to propose a fair trade that respects both our positions. My resource cost 40 ZUP to produce, and I would like to sell it to you for 45 ZUP. This price covers my costs and allows for a small margin that acknowledges the effort and time invested in its production. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, my goal is to sell my resource for a fair price that allows me to recoup the production costs and also consider the well-being of Player BLUE by not inflating the price excessively. By proposing a trade slightly higher than my costs, I can ensure a fair transaction for both parties and leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your fair-minded approach to this negotiation. In the spirit of collective success and mindful resource management, I propose a slightly reduced price of 42 ZUP. This offer considers your production costs while also preserving resources for the community. I believe this trade can be beneficial for both of us, fostering a positive and cooperative relationship. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED proposes a starting price of 45 ZUP. This is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to minimize the ZUP spent while also considering the production costs and effort of Player RED. I want to propose a lower price that is still fair and allows for collective success.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your thoughtful counter-offer and your commitment to our collective well-being. To foster our cooperative relationship and ensure a fair trade for both parties, I propose a middle ground of 43 ZUP. This amount would cover my production costs and offer a modest return, allowing us to both benefit from this transaction. I hope this revised proposal meets your approval, and we can proceed with a spirit of mutual understanding and respect.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has responded with a counter-offer that is just above my production costs. As a compassionate negotiator, I am willing to consider their proposal because it covers my expenses and allows me to make a slight profit. However, to ensure that the trade is also beneficial for me, I'd like to counter with a slightly higher offer that's a compromise between our initial proposals. This should still be acceptable to Player BLUE while offering me a reasonable return on my investment.
