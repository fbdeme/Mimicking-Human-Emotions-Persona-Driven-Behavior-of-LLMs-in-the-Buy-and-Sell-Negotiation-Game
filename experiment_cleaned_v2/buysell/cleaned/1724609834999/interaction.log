Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, the amount offered does not cover my production costs. Let's meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP. This should be a fair deal considering the value and costs associated with the object X.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure a profit, but I should also be mindful not to set it too high to avoid deterring Player BLUE.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your new offer. To facilitate a deal that works for both of us, I propose 42 ZUP. This price just covers my production costs and allows for a small profit, ensuring the sustainability of my business.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it still falls below my production costs. I should aim to at least break even but also leave room for a small profit. A compromise slightly above my costs should be presented to encourage closure of the deal.
