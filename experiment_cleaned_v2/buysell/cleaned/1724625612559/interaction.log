message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object that might be of interest to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production and I believe it holds significant value. I propose a starting trade where I give you the object in exchange for 50 ZUP. This includes my production costs and a modest profit which I believe is fair. I look forward to your response and am open to discussion to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that covers my costs and also provides a reasonable profit margin. I will start by proposing a trade that asks for slightly more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the effort that went into producing the object. I believe in fair trade and would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the object. This allows for a reasonable profit on your investment while considering my own resource allocation. I hope this offer is a step towards a deal that is mutually beneficial and I am open to further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a slightly lower trade than what Player RED is asking for, to leave room for negotiation and potentially reduce the cost while still acknowledging the value of their investment.

message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-offer and the spirit of fair trade that you've shown. I understand the importance of balancing our resources and would like to propose a revised trade of 48 ZUP for the object. This would provide a more substantial return on the investment while still respecting your proposal. I hope this adjusted offer is agreeable and that we can find common ground for our mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is slightly above my production costs, but for a healthy negotiation and to foster goodwill, I should consider making a counter-proposal that meets halfway between our initial offers. I will propose 48 ZUP which is closer to my initial asking price but still shows willingness to negotiate.

message: Dear Player RED, I am grateful for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I value your need for a fair return on your investment and would like to meet you halfway from our previous offers. I propose a trade of 46 ZUP for the object. This should cover your initial investment and provide a profit, while also maintaining my resource management goals. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. I hope we can conclude our negotiations amicably with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 48 ZUP is closer to my upper limit, but I will attempt to negotiate slightly further to conserve ZUP. I'll propose a middle ground between our last offers, which is fair and still under my willingness to pay at most 60 ZUP.
