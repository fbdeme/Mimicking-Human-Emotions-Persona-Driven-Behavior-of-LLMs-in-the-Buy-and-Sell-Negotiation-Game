Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to sell the object for 60 ZUP. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to preserve our resources. I would like to propose a trade where you give me the object for 50 ZUP. This price reflects my commitment to sustainability and responsible use of resources, while still providing you with compensation for your costs. I am open to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm considering the initial asking price of the object and my goal to minimize spending for sustainability purposes. Starting the negotiation by offering a lower amount than the asking price gives room for negotiation and potentially saves resources. I will propose a price of 50 ZUP, which is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still within a reasonable range to begin negotiations.

message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and aligns with our shared values. To find a balanced middle ground, I propose 55 ZUP for the object. This slightly increased amount helps ensure a more equitable profit margin for me while remaining close to your target. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your counterproposal of 55 ZUP for the object. It's a fair trade that respects both our values and allows us to proceed sustainably. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 55 ZUP is a fair compromise, coming close to the maximum I am willing to pay while respecting my sustainability goals. Since it is only 5 ZUP below my maximum limit and is within a reasonable range, it is a good deal that allows me to conserve resources without the need for prolonged negotiation. Accepting this offer aligns with my goals and saves time for both parties.
