message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiation is 45 ZUP, allowing us both to work towards a deal that benefits us mutually. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to cover my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. Proposing a price slightly higher than my costs could give me some flexibility to come down in price during the negotiation process.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort you put into producing the object. How about we start at 30 ZUP for X? I believe this could be a fair initial step for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed an initial offer of 45 ZUP for X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I'll propose a counteroffer to aim for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand where you are coming from, but 30 ZUP is beneath my production cost. Let's meet halfway. How does 37 ZUP sound? It is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to make a concession to move towards a deal that we can both be happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE, the proposed amount of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, and I would like to at least break even. I will propose a compromise that meets us in the middle, which still gives Player BLUE a discount and allows me to cover my costs.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 35 ZUP. I accept this offer as it reflects both our interests and allows us to finalize this negotiation positively. I'm glad we could come to a fair agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer of 35 ZUP is very close to my production cost, and considering my community-minded approach, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial transaction. This will allow me to recoup most of my costs and will enable us to complete this negotiation amicably.
