message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. This price includes a margin above my costs, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object which is 40 ZUP. My initial proposal will be slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but the price you're asking for is above my budget. I'm looking for a more cost-effective option.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is asking for a price that is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay, and it doesn't align with my goal of spending the least ZUP possible.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about I lower the price to 45 ZUP for object X? This should be more in line with a cost-effective solution for you while still respecting the costs I've incurred in production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer, indicating that 50 ZUP is above their budget. To move the negotiation forward, I will lower my asking price, but I still aim to cover my production costs and make a small profit.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you to close this deal. Let's try a price of 42 ZUP for object X. This is just slightly above my production costs, and I hope it's within the range you're willing to pay. This should be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my second offer as well. In order to make a successful trade, I will need to propose a price closer to my production cost. This will minimize my profit, but I must consider the possibility of not selling the object at all if the price is too high for Player BLUE.
