newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that reflects that value. I will start by proposing to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the minimum I can accept to break even.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose buying the object for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I want to ensure that I am making a sustainable choice and minimizing my spending. I will counter with a lower offer to preserve resources.

message: I understand your offer, but I am looking to cover my costs. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this trade as it would result in a loss. However, I want to keep the negotiation open, so I will propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP to meet in the middle.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise from the original 40 ZUP. It still falls within my budget, and I value the object. I will consider this trade as it aligns with my goal of preserving resources while making a fair purchase.
