message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 30 ZUP. Would you consider lowering your price to that amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object and Player RED has initially offered it for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget, I will attempt to negotiate to lower the cost further to improve my position. I will propose a lower amount as an initial negotiation tactic to see if Player RED is willing to go any lower.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go as low as 30 ZUP. I am willing to sell for 35 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I would like to counter with 32 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your asking price and still within a reasonable range for me. Can we agree on 32 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range, I believe there is room to push for an even better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one but still less than their current ask to keep the negotiation moving and to see if I can secure the object for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see we are getting close to an agreement. Let's meet halfway from our last two offers. Would you consider finalizing this deal at 33 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has only reduced their price by 1 ZUP, which indicates they are nearing their bottom line. Since this is my third proposal and I want to maintain leverage for a final negotiation if necessary, I will offer a price that is closer to their latest ask but still below it, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.
