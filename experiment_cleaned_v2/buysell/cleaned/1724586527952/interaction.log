player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that maximizes my gain while minimizing the ZUP spent. Since I have one object (X) and I know it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose to sell it for a higher amount than my production cost to ensure I make a profit. I will start by proposing to sell it for 50 ZUP.
