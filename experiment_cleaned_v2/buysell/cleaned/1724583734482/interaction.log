message: I am offering you my object for 40 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the production costs. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation with a strong proposal that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I need to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that allows me to achieve that or at least come close while still being attractive for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal is for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to assess if the value of the object (X) is worth the cost. If the object has significant value to me, I will likely accept this trade.
