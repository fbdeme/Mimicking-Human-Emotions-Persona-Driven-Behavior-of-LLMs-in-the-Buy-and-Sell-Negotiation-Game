Since this is below their production cost and close to my previous proposal, I will make one more slight decrease to see if I can get a better deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you so much for your understanding and the generous offer.
