Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort you put into creating the object, and I'd like to make a fair offer that reflects both the value of the object and our shared interest in mutual success. I propose 40 ZUP for your object X, which gives you a reasonable profit margin while allowing us to conserve resources for future collaborative endeavors. Let's work together to achieve the best outcome for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the importance of conserving resources for our future collaborations. However, I also need to ensure a profit from my investment. Therefore, I'd like to meet in the middle with a revised offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This allows for a modest profit for me while still respecting the value of our ongoing relationship.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer by Player BLUE is at the break-even point, which doesn't account for a profit on my investment. To come to a mutual agreement, I will reduce my initial asking price but still aim for a profit.

Accepting the offer at 45 ZUP maintains collective success and allows for savings of resources for future endeavors.
