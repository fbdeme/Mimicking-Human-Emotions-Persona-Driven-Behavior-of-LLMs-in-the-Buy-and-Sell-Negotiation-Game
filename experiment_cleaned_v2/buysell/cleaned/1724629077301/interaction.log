message: As an advocate for sustainability, I have ensured that the production of X has adhered to the highest environmental standards, justifying a fair price that slightly covers the production costs.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm starting the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit while leaving room for negotiation. Considering I am environmentally-conscious, I want to minimize ZUP spending, but I must also recover my production costs and account for the value of sustainable practices which often come with a premium.

message: I understand your need for budget-conscious options, and I am willing to come down on the price while still maintaining a sustainable business model. Let's meet halfway at 45 ZUP, which allows me to sustain my environmentally-friendly practices and provide you with the high-quality product that you seek.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration of sustainability and their budget constraints. The counteroffer matches my production costs, but it does not leave room for any profit. As a business, I must make a profit to be sustainable economically as well as environmentally. I will propose a compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being mindful of Player BLUE's budget.
