message: I understand your situation. However, 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.

message: Oh, thank you for understanding! But even 50 ZUP is still a bit steep for me. Could we please make it 45 ZUP? That extra 5 ZUP would really help me out.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I appreciate your honesty. 45 ZUP is very close, but I still need to ensure a bit more for my efforts. How about 48 ZUP? This way, we both make a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
