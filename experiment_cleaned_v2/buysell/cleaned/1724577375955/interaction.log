message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP, which covers my costs and allows for a small margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To ensure that my costs are covered, I need at least 40 ZUP. However, to be compassionate and consider the well-being of Player BLUE, I will propose a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer for the object at 50 ZUP. However, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, taking into account the market conditions and the value of the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering less than what I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation and to try to get the best deal possible. I'll offer 40 ZUP, which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, to gauge the seller's flexibility and to anchor the negotiation in my favor.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP. To find a middle ground, how about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, my costs are covered, and I have a small margin for profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP covers my production costs but leaves no room for profit. To find a middle ground, I will propose a slightly higher amount that still respects their initial offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 45 ZUP. In the spirit of negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial price, I propose a further adjusted offer of 42 ZUP. This should cover your costs while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal. I'll counter with 42 ZUP, which is closer to their offer but still keeps me well within my goal range. This should be seen as a compromise, and it's still within a reasonable margin of my initial offer.
