message: I understand your asking price, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object X. This would still provide you with a profit while allowing me to conserve resources for potential future transactions. Can we meet at this new price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. Although it is within my goal of spending no more than 60 ZUP, I want to negotiate to try to lower the price to conserve my resources. I will start by proposing a lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would need at least 45 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a small profit. Would you be willing to meet me there?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This should cover your costs while still saving me some resources for other investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has countered with a new proposal of 45 ZUP. This is still within my budget of 60 ZUP, but I want to attempt to secure a better deal. My next proposal will be a slight increase from my initial offer, but still lower than RED's counteroffer to continue the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'd like to propose a final offer of 43 ZUP. This would give me a small profit while still being a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is better than my last counter and does provide me with a slight profit margin. However, I want to maximize my gain a bit more while still being reasonable. I’ll make one last counter.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your final offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. It seems like a fair deal for both parties. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has made a final offer of 43 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Considering this is a negotiation, it's important to reach a mutual agreement, and accepting the offer at this stage would allow me to secure the resource at a reasonable price while maintaining a good relationship with RED for potential future negotiations. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
