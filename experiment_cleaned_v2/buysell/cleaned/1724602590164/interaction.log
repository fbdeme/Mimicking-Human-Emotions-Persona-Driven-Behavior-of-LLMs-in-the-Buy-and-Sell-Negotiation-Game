message: I appreciate your need to cover costs, but as a savvy buyer, I must consider the best value for my ZUP. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 35 ZUP for the object, which is closer to your asking price while still providing me with a discount. What do you say?

reason: Player RED insists on selling the object for 40 ZUP, but I am determined to negotiate a lower price. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below their asking price to maintain my aggressive negotiation stance. I will aim for a price that is more favorable to me, yet closer to their expectations, potentially leading to an agreement.
