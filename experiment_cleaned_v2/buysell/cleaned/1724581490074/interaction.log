message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 20 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 40 ZUP is within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP, I want to push for a better deal. Starting with a more aggressive offer will give me room to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. How about we meet in the middle with a trade at 30 ZUP for my object (X)? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP, I need to consider my production cost. I will propose a compromise and suggest a slightly lower price of 30 ZUP, which is still below my initial proposal but more acceptable for me.

message: 30 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but I believe 25 ZUP is a fairer price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum limit. However, I can push for an even better deal to maximize my resources.
