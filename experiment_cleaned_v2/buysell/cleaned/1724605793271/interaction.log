message: Hello Player RED! I'm interested in the object you're selling. I value the object at 50 ZUP and I believe this is a fair starting offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that we're both happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade offering 50 ZUP for the object because it is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay (60 ZUP), which allows room for negotiation and ensures I am spending less ZUP while still making a reasonable offer to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I was really hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I think that would be fair for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more, and I'm willing to increase my offer to 45 ZUP to meet you halfway. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer of 45 ZUP because it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and it shows cooperation by meeting Player RED halfway from their expected price. This could help to establish trust and make it more likely for Player RED to accept the deal.
