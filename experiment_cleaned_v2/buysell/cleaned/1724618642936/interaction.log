message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial exchange. I propose to trade my object X for 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, ensuring a fair deal for the effort and resources invested. I believe this offer is a good starting point and am open to hearing your thoughts and counter-offers.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a diplomatic negotiator, my first proposal will be to recoup the production cost of my resource, X. I aim to start with a proposal that allows me to break even, but I'm open to negotiation. The initial proposal will be slightly above my cost to give room for negotiation.

Thank you for your acknowledgment, Player BLUE. I await your counter-offer with great interest and remain committed to reaching a fair and amicable agreement.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player BLUE has not made a counter-offer but has acknowledged the fairness of my initial proposal, I'm inclined to wait for their response before making any adjustments. It is important to maintain a cooperative stance and give Player BLUE the opportunity to counter-propose, which may lead to a faster agreement and maintain good relations.
