message: I really need to sell this object, and I hope you can consider my offer of just 10 ZUP. It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object for a reasonable amount of ZUP, but I also want to entice Player BLUE to lower their price significantly so that I can maximize my profit. Starting with a low proposal might prompt them to negotiate more favorably.

message: How about 5 ZUP instead? I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very reasonable and significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, my objective is to minimize the amount of ZUP spent.

message: I appreciate your offer of 5 ZUP, but I really need to get a bit more for this object. What do you think about 20 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 5 ZUP is a better offer than my initial proposal, it is still far below my production cost. I want to keep negotiating and perhaps find a middle ground that works for both of us. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: How about we meet halfway at 12 ZUP? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 12
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 20 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is room to negotiate further to minimize my expenditure.

message: Thank you for your offer of 12 ZUP! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I think this is a fair deal. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting at 12 ZUP is a significant improvement from my previous proposals, and while it is still below my production cost, I can see the willingness to negotiate from Player BLUE. This may be my best chance to sell the object while still feeling like I've gained something. I will accept this proposal.
