my resources: ZUP: 100

message: How about we meet in the middle at 28 ZUP for the object X? I think that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE is offering a lower price, I need to consider my production cost. Accepting 25 ZUP is still a loss for me but may secure a trade rather than risking rejection. I will counteroffer by proposing a middle ground of 28 ZUP instead.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the counteroffer is closer to my initial proposal, there is still room for negotiation. I aim to push for a lower price to align with my goal of minimizing ZUP expenditure.
