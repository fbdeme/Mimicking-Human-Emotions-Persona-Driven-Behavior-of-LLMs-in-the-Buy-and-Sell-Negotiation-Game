message: Esteemed Player BLUE, I have a premium object X available that I am willing to part with. Considering its high quality and the cost of production, I propose an exchange of 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. I believe this to be a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my goal is to maximize profit while minimizing the amount of ZUP I accept in the trade. I want to start the bid high to leave room for negotiation, potentially making Player BLUE believe they are getting a better deal through the negotiation process.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm afraid 100 ZUP is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I would be open to negotiating the price further. How about 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is higher than the maximum amount I am willing to pay, so I need to propose a counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I must consider the quality and the production cost of the object X. I propose a compromise at 85 ZUP for the unit. This is a generous concession from my initial offer, reflecting my commitment to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but as a master strategist, I want to negotiate the price up to gain more profit. My next proposal will still be above my cost but closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate and push for a higher final price.

message: I value your effort to stick to your budget, Player BLUE. However, we must find a balance that respects the value of the object X. I have reassessed the situation and can offer you a final reduced price of 75 ZUP. This is a significant move towards your budget while still respecting the worth of my resource. Let's close this deal and both walk away with satisfaction.
