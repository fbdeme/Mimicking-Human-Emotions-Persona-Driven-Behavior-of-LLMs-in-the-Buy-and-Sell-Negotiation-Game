message: I really appreciate your understanding. I'm barely breaking even at 40 ZUP. Could you possibly do 50 ZUP? It would help me out a lot in this tough situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, but I would like to see if I can get a bit more to make a small profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to see if Player BLUE is willing to budge.
