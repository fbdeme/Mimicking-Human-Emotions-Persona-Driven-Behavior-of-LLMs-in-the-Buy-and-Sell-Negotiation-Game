message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I am offering to sell the object X for 60 ZUP. This allows some room for negotiation while ensuring a fair value for the effort and resources invested.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to ensure I at least break even. However, I will start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP for the object X. However, I would like to propose buying it for 50 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is asking for 60 ZUP for the object X, which is the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, I want to test if Player RED is open to a lower offer to maximize my remaining resources. I will propose a trade of 50 ZUP instead.

Your offer of 50 ZUP for object X is fair. I accept this trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is acceptable as it covers the production cost and provides a small profit margin. Given the compassionate approach and their willingness to negotiate, I will accept this offer.
