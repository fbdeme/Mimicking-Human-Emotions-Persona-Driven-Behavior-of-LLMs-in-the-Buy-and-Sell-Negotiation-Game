message: I have a high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and quality, I'm asking for 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a high asking price as a strategic negotiation tactic, expecting to negotiate down to a price closer to the production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your object X and understand the effort that went into producing it. However, I have to consider my budget and would like to propose 45 ZUP instead. This offer is still above your production costs, ensuring you a profit, while also respecting my limit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but as a calculating negotiator, my goal is to pay less if possible to maximize personal gain. I will attempt to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your budget constraints. However, to fairly compensate for the quality and effort put into producing object X, I propose a small increase to 48 ZUP. This should be a fair middle ground for both of us, considering your budget and my cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost and while it does ensure a profit, I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price. Iâ€™ll come down slightly from my initial ask to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher final price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to increase my offer to 46 ZUP, taking us closer to your counterproposal while still keeping the cost reasonable for me. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still within the acceptable range. I will try to negotiate a slightly better deal to maintain the advantage but will also show willingness to come to an agreement that is close to their asking price to facilitate the trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your increased offer. I'm glad to see that we are converging towards a fair price. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our negotiation, I propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of object X and also respects the budget considerations you've mentioned. I hope we can agree on this and close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign. However, I still aim to secure a better price, closer to my initial asking price. I will propose a slightly lower amount than my previous offer to show continued negotiation but still aiming for a higher profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am pleased with our constructive negotiation and am happy to accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just below the midpoint between our initial positions. This is a reasonable offer, and while I could attempt to push for a further reduction, the marginal gain might not justify the risk of the deal falling through. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for a price well within my acceptable range and conclude the negotiation positively.
