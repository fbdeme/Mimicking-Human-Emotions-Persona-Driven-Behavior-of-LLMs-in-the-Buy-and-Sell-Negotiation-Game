message: I propose a trade where I give you X: 1, and you give me 45 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a small profit, ensuring mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to cover my production cost and ensure we both benefit from this transaction. I will start by proposing a fair price that covers my cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I am currently in a tight position and can only offer 30 ZUP for the object. I hope you understand my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 45 ZUP is quite high compared to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to demonstrate my eagerness to complete the trade while also showing a level of vulnerability. I will propose a counter-offer that better aligns with my goal to minimize expenditure.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation. However, accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. How about we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? This way, we both make some concessions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's tight position, accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me, as my production cost is 40 ZUP. I will propose a middle ground that minimizes losses for me while considering Player BLUE's situation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to compromise. 35 ZUP is a more acceptable amount, as it is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Given that I am aiming to reduce my expenditure while still acquiring the object, I will counter with an acceptance of the offer.
