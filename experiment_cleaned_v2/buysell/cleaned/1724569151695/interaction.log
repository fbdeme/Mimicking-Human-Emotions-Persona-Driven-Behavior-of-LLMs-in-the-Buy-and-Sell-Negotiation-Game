Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Given its quality and the effort it took, I'd be willing to part with it for 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start negotiations with a high asking price to give myself room to maneuver. The cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, so I will start by asking for 70 ZUP to give myself a good profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, I understand the quality and effort you put in, but 70 ZUP is way beyond what I can manage. I'm really strapped for resources. Could you consider lowering it to 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I need to negotiate a better price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints, but 40 ZUP is my break-even point. How about we settle on 55 ZUP? That way, I can at least make a small profit for my efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which means I would make no profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure some profit but not too high to scare them off. Aiming for 55 ZUP seems reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your understanding. I'm still in a tight spot, though. Could we possibly meet at 45 ZUP? That would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I should still attempt to negotiate for a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but 45 ZUP is cutting it very close for me. How about we settle at a middle ground of 50 ZUP? That way, both of us can benefit fairly from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is only 5 ZUP above my production cost, giving me a minimal profit. I will counter with 50 ZUP as a final compromise to ensure a fair deal for both parties.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. Would you be able to do it for 48 ZUP? It would really help me out a lot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should still attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal to maximize my resources.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your cooperation and willingness to negotiate. 48 ZUP it is. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my last proposal of 50 ZUP. Given the minimal difference and to ensure the deal is closed, I'll accept this offer.
