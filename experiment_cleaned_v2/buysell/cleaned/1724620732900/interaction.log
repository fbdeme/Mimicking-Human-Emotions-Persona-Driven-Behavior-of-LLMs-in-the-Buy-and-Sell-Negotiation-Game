message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects both the production cost and a modest profit margin, while also considering the importance of sustainability in our negotiations.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce them, I want to at least break even or make a profit. However, I am environmentally-conscious and want to minimize ZUP spending to promote sustainability. I'll start with a modest proposal above my cost to leave room for negotiation, ensuring that I can still achieve my goal while being open to a sustainable agreement.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my fourth and final proposal, and Player BLUE has reiterated the trade terms without making a counteroffer or accepting the deal. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. I must now wait for Player BLUE to either accept the trade or propose a new trade themselves. If Player BLUE proposes a new trade, I will have to decide whether to accept or reject it, keeping in mind my goals and the sustainability commitment.
