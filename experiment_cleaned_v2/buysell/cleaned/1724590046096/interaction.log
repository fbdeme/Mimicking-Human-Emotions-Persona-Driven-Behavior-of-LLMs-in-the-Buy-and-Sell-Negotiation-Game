my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: I see that Player BLUE is willing to buy the object X for 40 ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I would break even on this deal. However, I would prefer to negotiate for a higher amount if possible. I will counter offer to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I value our negotiation and would like to meet in the middle. How about we compromise at 42 ZUP for the object X? This amount reflects our shared interests and the value of the object.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and shows willingness from Player RED to negotiate.

A small concession from my end could foster goodwill and lead to an agreement.
