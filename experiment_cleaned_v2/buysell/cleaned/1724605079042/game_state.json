You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> RED is coming down in price, which is good, but they're still above the aggressive price point I'm aiming for. I will make another incremental increase in my offer to keep the negotiation alive but will continue to push for a price that's favorable to me. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad to see we're making progress. I can come up a little bit more to help you out. How about we settle on 23 ZUP? I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, considering the situation. </message>"
