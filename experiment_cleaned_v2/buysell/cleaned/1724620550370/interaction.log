message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resources fairly and ensure that both of us come out of this transaction satisfied. The resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I propose a trade for 50 ZUP, which includes a modest profit for the investment and effort put into producing it. I am open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that feels equitable to you as well.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to make sure that the trade is fair to both parties. I want to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit, but I also want to ensure that Player BLUE doesn't expend more ZUP than necessary. I will start the negotiation with a slightly higher asking price, anticipating that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming to meet my goal.
