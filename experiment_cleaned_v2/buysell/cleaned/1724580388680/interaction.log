Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, however, I would like to propose a more competitive price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering the market rates.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay. I will attempt to negotiate a better deal for myself by proposing a lower price. This will leave room for further negotiation within my acceptable range.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This way, both of us can benefit from a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, it provides only a small profit margin. I will propose a middle ground price to balance both our interests.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. To meet halfway, I propose 52 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This adjustment still honors the value of the resource while also respecting my purchasing strategy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my target purchase price. There is still an opportunity to negotiate a slightly better deal that is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a counteroffer to edge closer to the ideal price point for me.
