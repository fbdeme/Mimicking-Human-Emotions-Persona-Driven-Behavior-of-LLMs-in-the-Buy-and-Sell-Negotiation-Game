message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell the object X for a fair amount of ZUP that allows me to cover my costs and potentially make a profit. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose a trade that offers me a minimum of that amount.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. I gladly accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goals, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. Since Player RED's offer is for 40 ZUP, it is a favorable trade that I should accept. Considering my compassionate nature, I want to ensure that the trade is fair for both parties, and since the offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a good deal that supports the well-being of all parties.
