my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Since I can't accept a loss, I will propose a compromise that is closer to my cost but still lower than my initial proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production cost is 40 ZUP. I am willing to meet that cost and offer 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed amount of 45 ZUP is reasonable, but I will try to negotiate a bit further down to save more ZUP. I will propose 40 ZUP, which matches their production cost.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my production cost. To make this trade beneficial for both of us, would you be willing to meet at 42 ZUP?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers my production cost, which is acceptable. However, it doesn't provide any margin for profit. To ensure a fair deal that benefits both parties, I will propose 42 ZUP as a final price.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
