message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. This is to cover my production costs and ensure we can both work towards a sustainable future. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover the cost of producing the resource, so I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP. However, I will aim to negotiate a fair price that considers both sustainability and the value of the resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While 40 ZUP is a fair offer, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I should try to negotiate a lower price to save more resources. A counter-offer of 30 ZUP might be a good starting point.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the object X. This would be a fair compromise that helps me cover my production costs while still being a reasonable offer for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of negotiation and sustainability, so I will propose a compromise that is closer to my costs while still being reasonable. Thus, I will counter with 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 ZUP is quite reasonable, but how about we settle on 33 ZUP? That would be a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is a fair compromise and still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should attempt to push the price down a bit further to save more resources for future trades. Proposing 33 ZUP might be a subtle yet effective negotiation tactic.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 33 ZUP. I believe we are close to an agreement, and I would like to propose 34 ZUP for the object X. This slight increase would help me cover my production costs and still be a fair deal for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer of 33 ZUP, as it is a step closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, it is still below my production costs. I will consider this in my next proposal, but I want to ensure I am not undervaluing my resource. Therefore, I will propose 34 ZUP as a fair compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 34 ZUP is very close to what I had in mind. However, would you consider 32 ZUP? It would be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal and is still well within my budget. However, pushing the price slightly lower to 32 ZUP could result in some additional savings.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offers and for the negotiation. However, I must unfortunately reject the offer of 32 ZUP as it does not cover my production costs. I appreciate your understanding, and I hope we can find a better opportunity in the future.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 32 ZUP, it still does not cover my production costs. I have made several proposals already, and I am reaching my limit. I believe we have negotiated fairly, but I must prioritize covering my costs. I will ultimately have to reject this offer, as it does not meet my minimum requirement.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry to hear that 32 ZUP does not cover your production costs. How about we go back to 34 ZUP? I believe that this will be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my offer of 32 ZUP, citing production costs. I have two proposals left. Given the current state of negotiations and the rejection, a counter-offer of 34 ZUP might be effective in closing the deal without pushing further.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to return to the offer of 34 ZUP. I accept this trade, and I believe it is a fair deal for both of us. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in reaching this agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I must now decide whether to accept or reject the latest offer. The offer of 34 ZUP is acceptable as it is closer to my production costs, even though it still does not fully cover them. However, given the negotiations and the value placed on sustainability and cooperation, I will accept this trade.
