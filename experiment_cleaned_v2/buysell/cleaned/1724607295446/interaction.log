message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and offers a reasonable return. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and offers a small profit margin. This will serve as a starting point for the negotiation, keeping in mind that I may need to adjust based on Player BLUE's counter-offers.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I'm interested in purchasing the object X, but I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP instead. I believe this still offers a fair return over your production cost. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is reasonable given that it covers their production cost and provides a small profit margin. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal. I will propose 45 ZUP to start the negotiation lower.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're on the same page regarding the value of object X. To meet halfway and foster our cooperation, I'd like to propose a compromise at 47 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a fair profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns with your valuation, and we can close the deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer and willingness to purchase. The offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial proposal and covers my production costs. However, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a more suitable profit for the resource I'm selling. A counteroffer of 47 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise between Player BLUE's offer and my initial asking price.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate the fair margin you are considering. To meet you just a bit closer to my initial offer, I propose 46 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 47 ZUP is very close to the initial proposal of 50 ZUP and is still within a reasonable range. However, I want to try negotiating slightly lower to see if we can agree at 46 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm pleased that we could find a mutually agreeable middle ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for object X. I look forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is very close to my previous proposal. The offer of 46 ZUP still provides me with a profit over the production cost and shows a willingness to negotiate in good faith. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick sale and maintain a positive relationship with Player BLUE for potential future transactions. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
