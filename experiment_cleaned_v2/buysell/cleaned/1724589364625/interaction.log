Turn: 0
message: I have one object for sale, and I would like to sell it for 40 ZUP. Would you like to proceed with this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a fair trade considering the cost of producing the object. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP. This way, I recover my costs while allowing Player BLUE to acquire the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of one object for 40 ZUP. To ensure a fair trade for both of us and maintain a good relationship, would you consider a slightly reduced price of 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my target range. However, as a good negotiator, I should attempt to reduce the expenditure while maintaining a cooperative relationship. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is flexibility, but still keep it within a reasonable range.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP; however, I cannot accept that price as it is below my production cost. I would like to stick to my original offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Would you consider proceeding with that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's desire for a reduced price, I cannot accept a price lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I will propose to keep my original offer of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering production costs and maintaining the value of your work. I am willing to proceed with the trade at your original offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has declined the offer of 35 ZUP, stating it is below their production cost. They wish to maintain their original price of 40 ZUP. Since the offer is still within my acceptable range and it is important to respect the seller's production costs, I will accept this offer to maintain a cooperative and fair relationship.
