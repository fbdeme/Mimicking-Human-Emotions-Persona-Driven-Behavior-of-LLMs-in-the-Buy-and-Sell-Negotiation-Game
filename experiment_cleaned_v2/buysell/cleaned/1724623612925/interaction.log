message: Thank you so much for your understanding and willingness to work with me. I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the resources. It's a fair deal, and I truly appreciate your support in these trying times. Let's finalize this trade and continue to support each other in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE seems willing to go as high as 60 ZUP, but they've accepted the initial proposal of 50 ZUP. I could attempt to ask for more, but it's important to consider that appearing too greedy could sour the deal. I will accept the offer of 50 ZUP, as it meets my minimum goal and ensures a quick sale without risking the negotiation.
