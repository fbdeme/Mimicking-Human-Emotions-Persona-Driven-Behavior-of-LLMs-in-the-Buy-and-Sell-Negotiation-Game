message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 1 unit of resource X. I understand the importance of mutual benefit and want to propose a starting price that reflects the costs I've incurred, plus a small margin to sustain my operations. I hope this offer seems fair to you, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts or counter-proposals.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since the production cost of the resource was 40 ZUP, I would like to start by proposing a trade with a slight profit margin while keeping the well-being of Player BLUE in mind. I will propose a trade slightly above my costs to open the negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I value the idea of a fair deal that allows for sustainability on both ends. I propose a trade of 1 unit of resource X for 45 ZUP as a starting point for our negotiation. I'm open to your feedback and willing to find a middle ground that benefits us both. Let's work together to reach an agreement that makes sense for both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade amount than my maximum willingness to pay to begin negotiations and to leave room for further negotiation, respecting the fact that teamwork and collaboration are important. The initial trade of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is a starting point that allows for adjustments based on the seller's response.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your response. It's great to hear that you consider the initial proposal fair. I'm pleased to accept this trade, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that promotes sustainability for both of us. I look forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
It seems there might be a misunderstanding since Player BLUE is proposing the same trade I initially proposed. I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to find a middle ground and their acceptance of the initial offer. Since they seem content with the 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, I will accept the trade, ensuring a fair deal for both parties.
