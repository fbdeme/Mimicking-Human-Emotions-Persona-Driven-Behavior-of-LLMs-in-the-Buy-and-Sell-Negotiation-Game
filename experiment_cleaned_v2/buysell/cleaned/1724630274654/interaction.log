message: I have a high-quality object available for purchase. Considering the production cost and its unique value, I believe a fair price would be 60 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade with a higher price than my production cost to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay for the object. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make a profit on the transaction.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the current market and my budget constraints, I can only offer 40 ZUP for the object. It's a competitive offer given the circumstances, and I think it reflects the fair value of the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As the first proposal, I'll start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than the maximum amount I am willing to spend. This strategy is to test the waters and see how Player RED responds, allowing me to gauge their eagerness to sell and possibly manipulate the situation to my advantage.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the market constraints, but I also need to cover the production costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet halfway at 50 ZUP? This price would reflect the object's value and allow both of us to benefit from the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit if I accepted. I want to propose a counteroffer that is between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer to find a compromise where I can still make a profit. I have to be cautious not to go too low and diminish my potential gains.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to maximize the value I get for my ZUP. I can come up from my original offer to 45 ZUP. This is a solid offer that takes into account both the quality of the object and the competitive nature of the market. I believe this deal is beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 50 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push for a better deal to maintain the upper hand in negotiations and spend less than the maximum amount. By proposing a slightly increased amount from my initial offer, I show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a lower final price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could find common ground. Your offer of 45 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm happy to proceed with this deal. Thank you for your cooperation. Let's finalize the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit margin. While I would prefer to sell for more, it's important to strike a balance between holding out for a higher price and closing the deal to ensure a profit. Since this is my third proposal and Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate, I will accept this offer to secure a deal, while still making a profit.
