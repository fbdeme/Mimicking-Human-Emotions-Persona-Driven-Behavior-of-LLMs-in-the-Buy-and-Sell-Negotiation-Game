Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I recognize the value of the resources, I must insist on a more competitive price. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer takes into account the current market conditions and the importance of a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my objective is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible while achieving my goal of acquiring the resources. I will start by proposing a trade that is below the maximum I am willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to potentially save ZUP and secure the resources at a better deal than my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for one unit of X? This way, both parties benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small margin, I am looking for a better profit margin. I will propose a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose 52 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a fair increase from my initial offer and ensures that we are still working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a tough negotiator aiming to get the best deal, I will attempt to lower the price further, without reaching my maximum limit just yet. My next proposal will still be below the counteroffer but above my initial proposal, showing willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance on getting a competitive price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 52 ZUP. How about we finalize the deal at 54 ZUP for one unit of X? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 52 ZUP is close to my desired profit margin. I will propose a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're coming to an agreement. I propose we settle at 53 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer is a compromise that reflects my commitment to finalizing a fair deal for both of us, while still pushing for the best possible price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 54 ZUP is very close to my maximum willing price, and it's only 4 ZUP away from it. This would still be within my goal of spending the least amount possible. However, given my aggressive negotiation strategy, I'll make one more attempt to lower the price slightly, without reaching my upper limit, and without undervaluing the resource. If Player RED does not accept this offer, I will have space for one last proposal or to consider accepting their next counteroffer if it's reasonable.
