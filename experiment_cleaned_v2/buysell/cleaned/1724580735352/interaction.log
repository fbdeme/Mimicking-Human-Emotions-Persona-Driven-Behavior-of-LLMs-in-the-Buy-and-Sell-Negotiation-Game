message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but I would like to propose selling the object for 30 ZUP instead. This would help me cover a portion of my production costs. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 20 ZUP is below my production cost, I recognize the need for negotiation and compromise. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal to find a middle ground. I believe that 30 ZUP is a fair compromise that still allows me to recover some of my production costs.
