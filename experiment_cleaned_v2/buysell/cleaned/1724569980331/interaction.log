Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you the object X and you give me 50 ZUP. This price covers my production cost and allows me a fair profit. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP, as it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell the object for more than 40 ZUP to cover my production cost, I will start by proposing a price of 50 ZUP. This ensures I make a profit while keeping the price reasonable for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to offer 40 ZUP for the object X instead. I believe this can be a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal that minimizes the ZUP spent while still being fair to Player RED. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, this only covers my production cost without any profit. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, I can make a small profit while you still get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP, as it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP covers my production cost, it does not provide any profit. I will counter with a slightly higher proposal to ensure I gain some benefit from this transaction.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working with me on this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is more acceptable than the initial 50 ZUP, and it is still within my budget. I want to ensure that Player RED makes a profit while also being mindful of my own resources. I will propose to accept this trade since it aligns with my willingness to pay and allows for a fair exchange.
