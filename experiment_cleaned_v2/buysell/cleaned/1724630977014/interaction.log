message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available, which cost me a significant amount to produce. Given its exceptional value, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange. I'm sure you'll find this to be a fair starting point for a resource as valuable as X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I want to sell my resources for ZUP, I need to start at a price point that gives me room to negotiate but also doesn't scare away Player BLUE. I will propose a higher amount than my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to give myself some leverage in the negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer, however, I have to consider my expenses and the current market value. I propose 30 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that reflects the competitive nature of the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am a cutthroat negotiator, my initial proposal will be significantly lower than what Player RED is asking, as well as lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This will allow me room to negotiate upwards while still attempting to secure the best possible deal.

message: I understand your concern about market value, Player BLUE. However, the market doesn't always recognize the true value of exceptional resources like X. I've already offered a significant discount from my initial price. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP. This is a very competitive price for a resource of this caliber, and I'm sure you will not regret the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to counter with a higher amount that gets me closer to my goal but still shows willingness to negotiate. I should aim to undermine their confidence in their market assessment while pushing for a better deal for myself.

message: While I respect the quality of your resource, I am still bound by my budget constraints. I can offer 35 ZUP, which is a step up from my initial proposal and reflects my intent to negotiate in good faith. Let's work together to find a price that is agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has only slightly lowered their asking price, which is still higher than my initial counteroffer. I will raise my offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving but will remain well below my maximum willingness to pay. This also leaves room for further negotiation.

message: It's encouraging to see your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I appreciate your increase in the offer and, to demonstrate my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to come down further on my price. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This price covers my production costs and offers you the resource at a price that's fair for both of us, considering its exceptional quality. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production cost, but they have shown some flexibility by increasing their bid. I should aim to secure a deal that at least covers my costs while pushing for a small profit margin. It's important to show some concession to keep the negotiation moving forward but also to assert the quality and value of my resource to justify a higher price.

message: Your willingness to adjust the price is commendable, Player RED. In the spirit of compromise, I'll raise my offer to 38 ZUP. This is a strong move towards your asking price and reflects my seriousness about this deal. Let's aim to finalize an arrangement that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made another concession, but the price is still above my initial offer. I have room to negotiate and will make a small increase to edge closer to a more favorable middle ground without reaching my maximum limit. This should convey a continued interest in negotiation while also pushing for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your constructive approach, Player BLUE. I recognize and appreciate your efforts to find common ground. As a final offer, I propose an even 40 ZUPâ€”this meets my production cost, ensuring that I'm not at a loss, and provides you with the resource at a fair price. Let's finalize this deal and move forward with a partnership that could lead to more beneficial transactions in the future.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made another incremental increase in their offer, which is still below my production cost. However, since this is my final proposal, I need to secure a deal that at least allows me to break even. It will be crucial to exert pressure on Player BLUE to accept a higher price, emphasizing the concession I'm making and the value they're getting.
