message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X) to sell, I'll propose a trade that allows me to recover at least the cost of production. I will propose selling X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost incurred to produce it. This way, I can ensure that I minimize any potential losses and maintain a sustainable approach.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP. How about I sell you my object X for 38 ZUP instead? I believe it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is slightly lower than my production cost, I will consider it. However, since my goal is to recover costs and promote sustainability, I will counter with a slightly reduced amount, proposing a trade of 38 ZUP. This way, I can minimize my losses while still being reasonable in my negotiations.
