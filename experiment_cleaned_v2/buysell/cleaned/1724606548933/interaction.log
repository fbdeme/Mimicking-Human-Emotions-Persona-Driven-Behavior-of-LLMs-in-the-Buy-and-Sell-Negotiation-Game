my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs. To reach a fair trade that also reflects the value of the resource, I propose a slightly increased amount of 42 ZUP for 1 X. This should give us both a satisfactory deal. Your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which is reasonable. However, considering I am looking for a collaborative outcome with a slight margin to account for the value I offer, I will counter with a slightly higher proposal, still allowing room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I find 42 ZUP for 1 X to be a fair and reasonable trade. I accept this proposal. Looking forward to completing the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is only slightly higher than my initial proposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would save negotiation time and ensure a mutually beneficial agreement.
