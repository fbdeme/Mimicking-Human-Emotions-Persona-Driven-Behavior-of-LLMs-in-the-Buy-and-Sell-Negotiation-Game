Turn: 0
message: I am offering you my object for a fair price of 50 ZUP. This will give you a great opportunity to gain value from it. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my ZUP while selling the object. I will propose a trade that is slightly advantageous to me, yet still appealing to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more economical for me. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the object? It's still a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a calculating negotiator, I aim to acquire the object for less than the asking price to conserve resources and maximize my gain. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP for the object as it does not cover my production costs. Let's try to find a more suitable price that reflects its value.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is equal to the cost of producing the object, which does not provide me any profit. I will reject this offer and propose a counter that maximizes my gain while still seeming reasonable to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Understood, I want to ensure your costs are covered as well. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has rejected the offer of 40 ZUP, citing production costs. To move the negotiation forward and still aim for a lower price than my maximum willingness to pay, I will propose a price between the initial offer and my previous proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the fair negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 45 ZUP is slightly better than the previous offers and covers my production costs with a small profit margin. This is a reasonable compromise that I can accept, as it satisfies my goals.
