newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is interesting, but I need to make the most out of my ZUP. How about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to spend the least ZUP possible. I will propose a lower amount to try and get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 20 ZUP. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer of 20 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I need to counter with a better proposal that still helps me recover my costs. I will counter with a trade of 35 ZUP, which is a compromise that is still lower than my original asking price but better than the current offer.

message: I understand your position, but I believe 25 ZUP is a fairer price for the object. Let's meet halfway.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will continue to push aggressively to get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is an improvement over the previous offers, it is still below my production cost. However, considering the negotiations and the need to conclude this trade, I will accept this offer to recover some of my costs rather than risk ending up with no trade at all.
