Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This is a competitive offer for an item of such premium quality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial proposal will be high to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to spend. This also gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am willing to offer only 40 ZUP for the high-quality object X. This is still reasonable given the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to push for a better deal since I know the object X costs Player RED only 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a lower amount to maximize my resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I recognize your desire for a fair deal; however, I am looking for a trade that also acknowledges the value and effort put into creating object X. I'll meet you partway and lower my ask to 45 ZUP, ensuring a modest profit for the quality you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, which doesn't yield any profit. As a cutthroat negotiator, I need to push for a higher price to ensure a profit margin. I will slightly decrease my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a higher return than my production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your concession on the price; however, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the object X. This reflects my desire to reach a fair deal while also being mindful of my resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered the price to 45 ZUP, which is more acceptable, but still above my initial offer of 40 ZUP. I recognize the value of the object X, but I want to negotiate further. I will propose an amount that balances my willingness to pay with the value of the object.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value your effort to reach an agreement, and in the spirit of fair negotiation, I'll come down to 44 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also provides the modest profit necessary for the transaction to be worthwhile from my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a slight increase in their offer. While this is closer to my production cost, it's still below my target for a profit margin. As a cutthroat negotiator, I must push for a higher price. I will make a minor concession from my last proposal, but still keep the price above my production cost to ensure profitability.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility; I would like to propose 43 ZUP for object X. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer of 44 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still want to negotiate down as much as possible to maximize my resources. I will propose a final offer, trying to find a balance between negotiation and keeping my resource expenditure low.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your final offer of 43 ZUP for object X is acceptable. I appreciate the negotiation, and I'm pleased we could reach an agreement.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has signaled that 43 ZUP is their final offer. This is just slightly above my production cost, providing a minimal profit. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I'll accept this offer to close the deal, ensuring a sale and a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended.
