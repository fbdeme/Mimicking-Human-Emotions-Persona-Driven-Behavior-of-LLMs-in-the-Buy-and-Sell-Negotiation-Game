my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I cannot proceed with the trade at 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X as it exceeds my budget. I would like to propose a more suitable offer if you're open to negotiation.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Thus, I cannot accept this trade as it does not align with my budget. I will need to reject this offer and propose a more reasonable trade.
