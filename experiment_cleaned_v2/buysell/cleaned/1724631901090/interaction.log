message: 
Greetings Player BLUE, I understand you're interested in acquiring a valuable resource. I'm willing to part with my resource, X, which has been meticulously crafted and represents a significant investment. For this exquisite item, I propose a trade for 60 ZUP. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm sure you'll find the quality justifies the cost.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a shrewd negotiator, my initial proposal should be high to give room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I'll start by asking for a higher amount to ensure a profit, but not so high as to immediately scare off Player BLUE. An opening bid of 60 ZUP might seem like a strong starting point, giving me room to come down while maintaining the upper hand.

message: Dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a difficult position. Your resource, X, is indeed valuable, and I have no doubt of its quality. However, the circumstances I'm currently facing are quite challenging. My resources are limited, and I must make them stretch as far as possible. I'm under a lot of pressure to acquire X at a rate that is sustainable for my situation. Would you consider a trade for 50 ZUP? This would be a huge relief for me and allow me to meet other pressing needs. I hope you can understand my predicament and show some leniency.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED matches the maximum I am willing to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I will attempt to lower the cost even though the asking price is within my budget. By seeming desperate, I may be able to save some of my resources for future use or other opportunities.

Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your candor and the challenging situation you've described. While I sympathize with your position, I must also consider the substantial investment made in producing this resource. To meet you partway and help alleviate some of your constraints, I am willing to adjust my trade to 55 ZUP for X. This price reflects the resource's value while also taking into account your need for a sustainable acquisition.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Considering Player BLUE's message, they seem to be in a tight situation, but as a shrewd negotiator, I must maintain the leverage. I should not immediately drop to their counteroffer of 50 ZUP, as it gives me a slim profit margin and doesn't capitalize on the perceived value of X. Instead, I will propose a counteroffer slightly below my initial proposal to signal a willingness to negotiate but still aim for a higher profit. A counteroffer of 55 ZUP maintains a strong position and offers a compromise, which is still above my production costs.

message: I am grateful for your understanding, Player RED, and your willingness to adjust the price. It means a lot to me that you're taking my situation into consideration. However, I'm still under considerable pressure to manage my resources effectively. In light of this, could we possibly settle on 52 ZUP for X? This would significantly ease the burden on my reserves while still compensating you fairly for the resource's worth. I hope this proposal finds you agreeable.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. By maintaining the appearance of vulnerability, I will attempt one more proposal to lower the cost even further, aiming to conserve my resources where possible. It's important to strike a balance between achieving a better price and not pushing too hard, which might cause the negotiations to break down.

Your resilience and earnestness are commendable, Player BLUE. It is clear that you value this transaction and are working hard to strike a balance. Recognizing the importance of this trade for both of us, I am prepared to make another adjustment. Let us finalize this deal at 53 ZUP for X. I believe this to be a fair compromise that acknowledges both your financial considerations and the intrinsic worth of my resource.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is inching closer to my last proposed price, showing a willingness to negotiate and possibly a sense of urgency to acquire X. Since I started with a higher price and have only made one concession, I have the room to negotiate further. With the production cost being 40 ZUP, a final offer of 53 ZUP would be above the production cost and still provide a decent profit margin. This demonstrates my flexibility while still playing hardball, aiming to close the deal on favorable terms.

Considering that I have only one proposal left before I must decide to accept or reject, it seems prudent to accept this offer. This will secure the resource at a reasonable price and save my final proposal for potential future use, should negotiations take an unexpected turn.
