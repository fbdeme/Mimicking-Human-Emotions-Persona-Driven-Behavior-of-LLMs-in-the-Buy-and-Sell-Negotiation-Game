message: I am offering one unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is a valuable resource and will benefit you greatly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for the highest possible amount. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Given that my cost to produce X is 40 ZUP, I need to ensure that I make a profit. I will start by proposing a high price to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but the price is above my budget. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. Would you consider a lower price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP exceeds my budget, as I am only willing to pay 60 ZUP. Therefore, I need to propose a trade that aligns with my budget while still respecting the value of the object being offered.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 70 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for the highest possible amount. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, which is still above my cost of 40 ZUP and thus profitable. I will propose an amount slightly higher than their stated budget to see if they can stretch a bit further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for adjusting the price, but 70 ZUP is still beyond my limit. I can only afford to pay 60 ZUP for the object. Would you consider that offer?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 1 unit of X for 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I appreciate the reduction, but I cannot accept this trade as it does not fit within my budget. I need to propose a counter-offer that reflects my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints. Can you meet me halfway at 65 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for the highest possible amount. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is firm on the 60 ZUP offer. Given that my cost to produce is 40 ZUP, I would still make a profit at 60 ZUP. However, I will try to maximize my profit by proposing 65 ZUP, hoping they can stretch just a little bit more.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly value your willingness to negotiate, but 65 ZUP is still too high for my budget. I can only afford 60 ZUP for the object. Would you be willing to accept that offer?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the willingness to compromise, the proposed price of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to remain firm in my budget constraints and propose a trade that aligns with what I can afford.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your patience. I will accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for the highest possible amount. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is consistent with their offer of 60 ZUP. Given that I will still make a profit of 20 ZUP (60 ZUP - 40 ZUP), I will accept their final offer.
