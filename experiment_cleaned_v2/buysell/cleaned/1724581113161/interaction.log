message: I am offering my object X for 60 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profitable deal. Since I can only propose 4 times, I will start with a trade that allows me to get a decent amount of ZUP for the object I have. I propose to sell the object for 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, allowing me to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I am interested, but I believe 40 ZUP is a fair price. Let's make a deal at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is at the maximum amount I am willing to pay. To assert dominance and potentially get a better deal, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose a trade for my object X at 50 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, it matches my production cost, leaving me with no profit. I want to counter the offer to ensure I make some profit from this trade, so I will propose a price that is still below my original offer but above my cost. I will propose 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I believe this would be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will attempt to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for a fair negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is more favorable than my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this trade would allow me to make a profit of 5 ZUP, which is acceptable. I will go ahead and accept this trade.
