message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, to ensure we're both benefiting and conserving our resources for future generations, I would like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this still provides a fair compensation considering the need for sustainable practices.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to conserve resources, including my ZUP. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to save ZUP while still making a fair trade offer.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of sustainability and mutual benefit. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 37 ZUP for the resource X. This allows us to share the cost evenly and ensures fair compensation for the resources provided. I hope this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's concern for sustainability and their proposed price is close to the production cost, I must also consider the need to recover the full cost. However, as a selfless negotiator, I'm willing to compromise slightly to meet halfway, ensuring we both benefit from the transaction.

message: Thank you for understanding the value of sustainable practices, Player RED. Your proposal of 37 ZUP for one unit of resource X is a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this offer, and I look forward to future cooperative endeavors.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 37 ZUP which is closer to my initial counter-offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. The offer is still within my acceptable range, and by agreeing to this price, I maintain my sustainability goals by not overspending. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation for both parties.
