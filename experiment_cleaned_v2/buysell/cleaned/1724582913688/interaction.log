message: Hello Player BLUE! I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I have for sale while being reasonable to entice Player BLUE to buy it. I will propose selling the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce it, as my initial offer.

message: Thank you for your offer. To ensure we both get the best deal possible, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, to maximize our resources and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, I will start by negotiating a bit lower.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for the object X. I believe itâ€™s a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below the production cost of the object (40 ZUP). I want to negotiate further and find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us. I will propose a trade of 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but shows willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object X? I believe this would be a fair and mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still within my budget. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal while keeping in mind the collaborative approach.

message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is closer to my initial offer of 40 ZUP. I am willing to accept this offer since it is better than 30 ZUP and 35 ZUP, and I would like to complete this trade rather than risk losing it.
