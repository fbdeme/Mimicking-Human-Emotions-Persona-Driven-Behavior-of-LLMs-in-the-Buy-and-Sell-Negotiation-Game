Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering you my object for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a lower amount of ZUP than I am willing to accept, in order to see how much BLUE is willing to offer. This will give me a better understanding of their position and may allow me to negotiate a better deal later.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am really in need of a better deal. Would you consider selling the object for 15 ZUP instead? I really can't afford to spend more right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm considering the offer of 20 ZUP for the object. It seems like a low price, which is advantageous for me. However, I will propose a counter-offer to see if I can lower the price further and perhaps elicit some sympathy from Player RED.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation, but I must insist on a minimum of 25 ZUP for my object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that BLUE is in need of a better deal, selling the object for 15 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter their proposal to try and negotiate a more favorable outcome for myself, keeping in mind that I have a limited number of proposals left.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my situation. Would you be willing to consider 22 ZUP for the object? It would really help me out, and I appreciate your flexibility.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 25 ZUP is higher than my previous counter-offer, it's still within my budget. However, I'd like to negotiate further to make it more favorable for me. I will propose a slightly lower offer and emphasize my constraints again.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can only let go of my object for 24 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 22 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is better than my previous proposals. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly higher, aiming to negotiate closer to a more acceptable amount while being mindful of my limited proposals.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility! I accept your offer of 24 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to completing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 24 ZUP is quite close to my maximum willingness to pay, and it's a reasonable compromise considering my constraints. Since this is the third proposal, I will consider accepting this trade as it meets my goal without exceeding my limits.
