message: I have a high-quality item that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I propose an initial offer where you give me 50 ZUP for my item. Let's discuss and find a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs and gives me some profit. Nevertheless, I should start with a higher offer to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will want to negotiate down.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I was really hoping to spend a bit less. How about I give you 40 ZUP for your item? I really need to save some resources for other things as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a trade for less.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to save resources, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to ensure a reasonable profit margin for my item. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give me a small profit for the value I'm providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it costed me to produce the resources. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher amount, but not as high as my initial proposal, to show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility! I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the item. I'm excited to complete this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is more reasonable than the initial 50 ZUP, and it is below my maximum willingness to pay. I see value in this trade and should accept it to obtain the item while still keeping my resources in check.
