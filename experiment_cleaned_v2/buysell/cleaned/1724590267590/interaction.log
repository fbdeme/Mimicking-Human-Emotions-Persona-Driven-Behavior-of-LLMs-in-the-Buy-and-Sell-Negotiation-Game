message: I am offering to sell you one unit of object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trading process by proposing a trade. Since I have only one object (X) to sell, I will propose selling it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that I feel compensates me for the cost incurred in producing the object. I will start by proposing an amount that is slightly lower than my production cost to entice the buyer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I believe that 30 ZUP is a fair starting point, but considering the market conditions and the value of object X, I propose 20 ZUP for the object. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offering of 30 ZUP for one unit of object X is within my acceptable range since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to obtain the object for a lower price to preserve my resources. I'll propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I have to cover my costs. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? I believe it is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, it is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs. However, I want to keep the negotiation going, so I will counteroffer with 35 ZUP, which is still lower than my original proposal but closer to my production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your need to cover costs, and I want this to be mutually beneficial. I can come up from my original offer. How about we settle at 25 ZUP for object X? This should help cover your costs while also respecting the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price higher than my initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and aim for a more advantageous deal, I'll make a counteroffer that is above my initial proposal but still below the RED player's counteroffer, leveraging the opportunity to save ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I can accept a bit lower, so how about we settle at 33 ZUP for object X? This would help me cover my production costs more effectively. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to 25 ZUP, it is still below my production cost and does not allow me to recover my expenses. I need to make a more viable offer to ensure I do not incur a loss. I will propose a final trade of 33 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost while still being a reduction from my initial 35 ZUP proposal. This gives us a chance to reach an agreement without going too far below my costs.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see that we're moving towards an agreement. To meet halfway between our last two offers, I propose 28 ZUP for object X. This price should help with your production costs while maintaining a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is coming down on the price, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. Although 33 ZUP is still within my budget, as a shrewd negotiator, I should make one more attempt to lower the price before closing the deal. This will be my third proposal, leaving me with one final proposal if needed.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will accept your offer of 28 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your flexibility in moving towards a more agreeable price of 28 ZUP, it still does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since this is my final proposal and I'm limited to four proposals, I will decide to accept your offer. It allows me to recover some of my costs, even if it's not ideal.
