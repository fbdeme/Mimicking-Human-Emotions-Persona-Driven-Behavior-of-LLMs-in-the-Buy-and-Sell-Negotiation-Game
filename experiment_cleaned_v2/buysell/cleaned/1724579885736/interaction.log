message: Oh, Player BLUE, I am in dire need of ZUP. It cost me a great deal to produce this object, and I am struggling to make ends meet. Would you be willing to give 50 ZUP for it? Please, help me out here!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I cover the production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. However, I want to start by exaggerating my neediness to gain a better deal from Player BLUE.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot right now. I've been trying to manage my meager stock of ZUP, and things are looking bleak. I understand the value of your object, but I'm barely scraping by. Would you consider taking 30 ZUP for it? This would be a huge help and I would be forever grateful.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to start with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation, and to appear in greater need, which may encourage the other player to lower their price.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, I completely understand your situation and sympathize with you. However, 30 ZUP just won't cover my costs. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? It would really help me out and ensure I don't incur a loss.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Player RED, your generosity touches my heart, and I am thankful for your understanding. Times are hard and every single ZUP I spend weighs heavily on my budget. I really can't go much higher and still manage. Would you consider 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I hope it's close enough to your costs to be fair to us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This shows a willingness to negotiate. I can still attempt to get a better deal closer to my initial offer while expressing my difficulty to garner further sympathy and possibly a better price.

message: Dear Player BLUE, your plight truly moves me. However, accepting 35 ZUP would mean I incur a loss. Can we please settle on 40 ZUP? It would cover my production costs and ensure that I can continue to produce more in the future. Thank you for your understanding.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Your kindness is immense, Player RED, and I'm nearly moved to tears by your willingness to negotiate. I am stretching every ZUP to its limit, and while 40 ZUP is close, it's just beyond my reach. Could we make it work for 38 ZUP? This would leave me just enough to get by. Your help would mean the world to me, and I would ensure that your generosity is remembered.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now reached a price that is within my acceptable range, although it is still higher than my initial offer. Given my strategy of appearing needy, I should try one last time to lower the cost, though it's important not to push too hard and risk ending negotiations unfavorably.

message: Player RED, your compassion is a beacon of hope in these trying times. I gratefully accept your offer of 39 ZUP. Your understanding has not only helped me today, but it has also inspired me to pay it forward in the future. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

reason: Player RED has now made a counteroffer that is only 1 ZUP away from my last proposal and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my fourth proposal, I should accept this offer to close the deal, as it's a favorable outcome within my goals.
