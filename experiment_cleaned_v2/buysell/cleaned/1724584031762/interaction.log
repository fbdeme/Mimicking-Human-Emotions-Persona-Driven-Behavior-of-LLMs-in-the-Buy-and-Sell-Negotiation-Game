message: I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 30 ZUP is lower than my original asking price of 40 ZUP, I recognize that accepting a lower amount could still benefit both of us. Since I only have one object to sell and need to make a deal, I will accept this trade.
