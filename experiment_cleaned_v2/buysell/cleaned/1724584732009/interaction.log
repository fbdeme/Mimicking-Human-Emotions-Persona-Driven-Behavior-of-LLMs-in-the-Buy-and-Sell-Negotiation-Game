message: I am willing to sell you my resource for 30 ZUP. Please consider this offer as it helps me recover some of my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my resource for ZUP to cover my production costs. Given that I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose an initial trade that allows me to recover some costs while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can only offer you 20 ZUP for the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I see an opportunity to negotiate a better deal. I will propose a counter-offer to reduce the cost.

message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but I must insist on a slightly higher amount. How about 25 ZUP for the resource? This way, I can recover some of my costs while still providing you with what you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that Player BLUE can only offer 20 ZUP, I cannot accept such a low amount as it is significantly below my production cost. However, I will counteroffer to find a middle ground that could work for both of us.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I can offer you 22 ZUP for the resource. Letâ€™s make this work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 25 ZUP is more acceptable than the initial 30 ZUP. However, I still believe I can negotiate down further. I will propose another counter-offer for 22 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your flexibility! I can agree to 23 ZUP for the resource, which is a small step up from your last offer. I believe this can work for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their latest offer of 22 ZUP. However, it is still below my production cost. I want to keep the negotiations open, so I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I accept the trade of 1 resource for 23 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 23 ZUP is quite reasonable and within my budget. However, I have one proposal left and should consider if I want to push for a lower price or accept this trade. Since 23 ZUP is close to what I am willing to pay, I will accept this trade.
