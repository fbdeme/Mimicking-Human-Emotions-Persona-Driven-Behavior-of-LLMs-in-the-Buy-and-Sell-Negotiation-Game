This is a strategic move to gain more from the trade. However, as an assertive negotiator, I will aim to bring the price down closer to the initial offer to maintain the upper hand and conserve my resources.

Given that I am an ambitious negotiator and have set a maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, there is room for me to accept this offer while still feeling like I've negotiated well. However, I want to leverage the negotiation to try to achieve an even better price, although I should be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will make a final counteroffer that is slightly higher than my last but still under their current asking price. </reason>\n<player answer> Propose a trade with </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
