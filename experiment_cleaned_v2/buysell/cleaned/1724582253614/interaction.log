message: I am offering you one object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have only one object (X) to sell, and I need to maximize my ZUP gain. I will propose a trade that reflects the cost of producing the object, while testing BLUE's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am willing to pay 25 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 40 ZUP is within my maximum willing to pay (60 ZUP), my goal is to lower my expenditure as much as possible. I will counter with a lower offer to initiate negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about I give you the object (X) for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While BLUE is offering 25 ZUP, which is below my production cost, I will counter with a lower amount than my original proposal, but still above their offer to see if they are willing to negotiate further. This could also test their limits.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I am willing to pay 28 ZUP for the object. Does that sound fair?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and still within my maximum willing to pay. However, to further lower my expenditure, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is better than their previous offer. I will accept this trade to minimize my losses and gain some ZUP, rather than risk ending up with nothing if they reject my next proposal.
