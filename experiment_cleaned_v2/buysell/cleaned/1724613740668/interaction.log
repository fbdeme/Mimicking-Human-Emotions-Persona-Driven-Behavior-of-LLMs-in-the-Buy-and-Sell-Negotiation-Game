message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and offers me a modest profit. I propose a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to start by asking for a bit more to ensure I cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with Player BLUE to come to a fair agreement.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you. Covering my production costs is important, but I also need to consider a small profit margin for sustainability. How about we meet halfway? I propose I give you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This way, I can cover my costs and make a slight profit, and you still get a fair price. Let's work together on this.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and our goal is to find common ground. While I understand your budget constraints, it's also important for me to achieve a minimal profit to sustain my business. How about we settle on 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This small adjustment in price from my initial proposal respects both our needs and allows us to continue our collaboration.

reason: Player BLUE is insistent on the 40 ZUP offer, which only covers my costs without any profit. Given that I prioritize teamwork and mutual benefit, I will propose a small concession from my previous offer to show my willingness to collaborate, while still aiming for a modest profit.
