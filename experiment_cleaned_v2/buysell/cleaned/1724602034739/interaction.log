my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I would like to propose a different trade that might work better for us both. How about this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 40 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal decreases the amount of X being offered and maintains the same ZUP offer, which is not in line with my goals. I will counter with a slightly higher ZUP offer to encourage a more beneficial trade while still aiming to keep the final cost below my maximum willingness to pay.
