message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This proposal ensures I cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I need to ensure I at least cover the production cost of 40 ZUP. Starting with a proposal that covers my cost will set a good baseline for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 40 ZUP would be a fairer price for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that the initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is reasonable but I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a counteroffer that can potentially lower my expenditure while still being acceptable to RED.

message: I understand your point. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, I cover my costs and we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 40 ZUP covers my production costs but leaves no profit margin. I will propose a middle ground to balance fairness for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I can do 42 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's find a way to make this work!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is an improvement from my previous offer of 40 ZUP. However, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. My aim is to secure the object for as low as possible, so I will counter once more while staying within my budget.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small profit. Given their willingness to compromise, I believe accepting this offer is fair and will foster good will for future trades.
