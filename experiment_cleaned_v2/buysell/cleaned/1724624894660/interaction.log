message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my resource. Let's discuss and see if we can make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP in a way that allows me to recover my costs and potentially make a profit. I will start with a proposal that is higher than my production cost to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concern about the budget. While I need to ensure that I make a reasonable profit on this trade, I am willing to come down a bit from my initial proposal. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource X? This price allows me to cover production costs and provides you with the resource within a closer range of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has responded with a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since my goal is to make a profit and the offer is still above my costs, I will counter with a slightly higher amount that could be a middle ground, but still ensures I make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand that you have budget constraints. I propose we meet halfway between our last two figures. How about 47 ZUP for the resource X? This price provides me with a fair profit margin while respecting your budget. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is proposing 46 ZUP, which is a slight decrease from my last proposal. Since it is above my production costs, it still ensures a profit for me and seems to be nearing Player BLUE's budget limit. I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale, but I will attempt one final negotiation to see if we can meet halfway from our last two proposals.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience and negotiation. I understand the importance of adhering to your budget. I am willing to accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the resource X. Let's proceed with this deal and finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reiterated their budget constraint, aiming to close the deal at 45 ZUP. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I must consider the risk of not making a sale at all. Although 45 ZUP offers a smaller profit margin than I initially aimed for, it is still above my production costs, and finalizing the trade would fulfill my goal of selling the resource. Therefore, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction.
