message: I'm offering the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and allows for a small profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What do you think?

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for the object. In the spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP. This allows us both to preserve resources for future investments and opportunities. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower price than initially offered because I want to save ZUP while still making a fair trade. I'm willing to go up to 60 ZUP, but starting lower gives me room to negotiate upward if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal. 45 ZUP is acceptable to me. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Their counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is quite close to my initial offer and still covers my production costs with a small profit. Given that the difference is minimal and considering the spirit of collaboration, I'm willing to accept this offer.
