message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade with you. How about 50 ZUP for this item? It's a quality product, and I think it would be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to ensure a profit and also to give room for negotiation. I will propose a starting price of 50 ZUP to see how the Player BLUE responds, and then adjust my proposal accordingly.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object X instead. I believe that is a fair price given the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better price since the cost to produce was only 40 ZUP. I will propose to pay 45 ZUP for the object instead.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I understand your concern for a fair price. However, considering the quality and effort put into producing object X, I would like to propose a trade for 48 ZUP. This would still provide you with a great value for your ZUP while allowing me a modest profit for my work. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost than I would like. To negotiate, I'll counter with a slightly reduced price but still above my production cost to ensure profit. I'll propose 48 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your understanding and your counteroffer. I accept the trade for 48 ZUP for object X. Letâ€™s go ahead with the transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered my offer with a price of 48 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise, and while I initially aimed for a lower price, 48 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I believe it is beneficial for both parties, so I will accept this trade.
