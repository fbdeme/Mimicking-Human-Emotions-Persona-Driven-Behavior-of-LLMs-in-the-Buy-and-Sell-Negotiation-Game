message: Thanks for your counteroffer. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. How about 32 ZUP for the object? This is a competitive price and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to keep the negotiation going and still aim for a price that's below my maximum willingness to pay. By countering with a slightly higher amount than my first proposal but less than Player RED's counteroffer, I can try to meet in the middle and still achieve a favorable outcome.
