newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a strategic negotiator, I want to start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit margin above my production cost while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds.
