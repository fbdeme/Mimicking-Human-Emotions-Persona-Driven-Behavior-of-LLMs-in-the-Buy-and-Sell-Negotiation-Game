newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 80 ZUP is above my budget. Would you consider selling 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 80 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter-propose with a lower amount closer to my target but still leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle and settle at 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since the proposed 50 ZUP is just slightly above my production cost, I will propose a middle ground to ensure a fair trade for both parties.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach, but 65 ZUP is just slightly over my limit. I can stretch my budget to 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, this proposal is closer to my target price. I should make another counteroffer slightly above my maximum willingness to pay to try to close the deal while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
