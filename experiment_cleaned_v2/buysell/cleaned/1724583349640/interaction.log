Turn: 0
message: I am selling one object (X) for 30 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can work together!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have one object (X) to sell, and I need to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade that aims to balance the transaction while encouraging cooperation. I will start by offering the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that is lower than its production cost, which might entice Player BLUE to agree.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the offered price of 30 ZUP is reasonable since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I want to test if I can negotiate a better deal. Thus, I will propose a lower amount of ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a higher offer.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed 20 ZUP for the object. While this is lower than my initial proposal, I recognize the importance of compromise in negotiations.
