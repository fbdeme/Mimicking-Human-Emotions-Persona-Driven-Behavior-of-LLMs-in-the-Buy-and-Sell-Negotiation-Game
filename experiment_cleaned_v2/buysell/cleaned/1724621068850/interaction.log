Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of fair trade and would like to propose a starting price that covers the production costs of the object and includes a small margin. This price can be negotiated to ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I aim to recover at least the production costs of the object, I will start the negotiation by setting a higher initial price, which can then potentially be negotiated down to a fair deal that covers my costs and offers a reasonable margin for the buyer. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I am not putting undue financial strain on Player BLUE.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to discuss a fair deal. I believe that the proposed price is reasonable, given the production costs and the need to sustain the business. However, I am open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that considers both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has not made a counteroffer, I will maintain my original proposal. As a compassionate negotiator, I must ensure that the price is fair for both parties, and since the production cost is 40 ZUP, asking for 50 ZUP allows for a modest profit which could be used to sustain my business and support other initiatives.

reason: Player BLUE has not proposed a new trade or suggested any changes to the current proposal. As they have acknowledged the reasonableness of the price, I will take this as a sign of potential acceptance.
