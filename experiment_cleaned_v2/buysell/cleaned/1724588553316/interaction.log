message: Hello Player RED! Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for it. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as a good negotiation practice, I'll attempt to acquire the object for a lower price to save resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE! How about I offer you the object X for 38 ZUP instead? I believe thatâ€™s a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I cannot accept this offer as it doesn't meet my minimum requirement. However, I want to keep the dialogue open and propose a middle ground that could be beneficial for both of us. I will propose a trade of 38 ZUP instead.

my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED's new offer is closer to my initial counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. It's still higher than my opening bid but remains within my acceptable range. I will attempt one more counteroffer to further optimize my expenditure while maintaining a collaborative negotiation tone.
