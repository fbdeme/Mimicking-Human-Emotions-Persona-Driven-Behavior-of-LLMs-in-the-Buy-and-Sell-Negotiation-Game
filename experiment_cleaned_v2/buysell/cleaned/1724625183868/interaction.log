message: I have an excellent quality resource X available for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I would like to propose a starting price of 45 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP, ideally at a price that covers my costs of production, which is 40 ZUP. I'm going to start the negotiation by proposing a trade slightly above my costs, expecting that player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to make a deal closer to the 60 ZUP mark. Can we negotiate the price further?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear you value the resource highly. While 60 ZUP is more than I expected, I understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. How about 52 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this is a fair increment from my initial offer and still gives you room for profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has expressed a desire to negotiate closer to the 60 ZUP mark. This is higher than my cost of production, which is good. However, I must consider that it is quite a jump from my initial offer. I should try to meet in the middle to further the negotiation in a favorable direction without going too low too quickly.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you towards a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to get closer to a resolution. Would you consider 50 ZUP for resource X? This price should allow us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is looking for a lower price, but has not proposed a specific figure. Since I have already increased my offer, making another concession should encourage Player BLUE to meet me closer to my asking price. Offering a slight decrease may move us toward a final deal.

message: I appreciate the willingness to find a resolution. However, I'm still looking to secure the resource at a lower cost. Can we continue to work on narrowing the price gap?

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and would like to find a common ground. I'm making my final proposal by offering resource X for 47 ZUP. This price takes into account both our positions and still ensures a fair deal. I hope this meets your expectations and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in seeking a lower cost, yet still has not suggested a specific counter-offer. As this is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject, I need to make it count. I should propose a price that is closer to my production cost, but still ensures a profit. I want to entice Player BLUE to accept the deal without going below my production cost.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I have made several attempts to meet you halfway, but it seems we are unable to reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. As such, I must respectfully end our negotiations. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of proposals without a specific counter-offer from Player BLUE. Since I cannot propose a new trade, I must decide to either accept or reject any further proposals from Player BLUE. At this point, if Player BLUE does not accept my last proposal, I must be prepared to end the game or accept a counter-offer if it meets my minimum selling price.
