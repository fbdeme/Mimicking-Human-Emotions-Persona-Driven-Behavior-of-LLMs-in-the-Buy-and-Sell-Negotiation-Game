Turn: 0
message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player BLUE. Unfortunately, 40 ZUP is the lowest I can go without incurring a loss. Since this does not seem to meet your budget requirements and I cannot propose any further reductions, I must respectfully withdraw the offer. Best of luck in finding the deal you're looking for.

reason: Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. I must now decide whether to accept Player BLUE's indication that they want to continue discussions or end the game.
