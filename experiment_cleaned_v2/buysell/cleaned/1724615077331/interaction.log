message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand that resources are valuable to both of us. I propose to sell you my object X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin for negotiation. I hope we can find a fair trade that respects our mutual interests. Looking forward to your counter-proposal or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a compassionate negotiator, I want to start the trade by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs but also consider the financial situation of Player BLUE. I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation and hopefully arrive at a fair price that suits both parties.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of finding a price that works for both of us. Would you consider meeting halfway at 42 ZUP for object X? This would allow me to sustain my resources while also being mindful of your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to meet the production cost. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I believe it's fair to seek a small margin to sustain my business without exploiting the other party. Therefore, I will propose a slightly higher amount that is closer to my initial proposal yet still reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. How about we settle at 41 ZUP for object X? I believe this could be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 42 ZUP is closer to my upper limit, but I still believe I can negotiate further down since I initially offered 40 ZUP. I will propose 41 ZUP to see if they accept just a little less.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful compromise, Player BLUE. I agree that 41 ZUP for object X is a fair price. I accept your offer, and I am pleased that we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a fair compromise that is very close to my previous offer. As a compassionate negotiator, it's important to create a win-win situation and maintain a good relationship for future interactions. Accepting this offer would cover my costs and provide a small margin, which is reasonable and equitable for both parties.
