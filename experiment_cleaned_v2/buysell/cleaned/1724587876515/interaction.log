message: As a final offer, I am willing to sell the object X for 25 ZUP. I hope this is a price you can agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I've already made three proposals, and Player BLUE is still looking for a better price. I need to be cautious as I can only propose once more before I have to accept or reject.
