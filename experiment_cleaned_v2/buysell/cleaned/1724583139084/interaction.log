message: I am offering to sell you my object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that is beneficial to me while also giving Player BLUE the chance to acquire the object. Since I have one object, I will propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. I will start by proposing to sell the object for 40 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I propose a counter-offer of 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I find the initial offer of 40 ZUP reasonable, but I would like to see if I can secure a better deal. My goal is to buy the object for as little ZUP as possible, ideally lower than the initial offer. However, I don't want to make a counter-offer that might offend Player RED and end the negotiation prematurely.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 35 ZUP instead. This is closer to my production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer, selling the object for 30 ZUP would not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will reject this counter-offer and propose to meet in the middle at 35 ZUP instead. This way, I can get closer to my production cost while also making it more attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 35 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 32 ZUP? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can bring it down just a bit more, without risking the deal. I will propose 32 ZUP as a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP. I would like to propose again for 35 ZUP, which is the minimum I can accept. I hope we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to compromise with a counter-offer of 32 ZUP. However, this amount is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade for 35 ZUP again, as it is the minimum amount I am willing to accept to cover my costs. I hope Player BLUE will see the value in this offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated that 35 ZUP is the minimum they can accept, and pushing further might risk the deal. Given that 35 ZUP is well within my budget of 60 ZUP, it makes sense to accept this offer to ensure the transaction is completed.
