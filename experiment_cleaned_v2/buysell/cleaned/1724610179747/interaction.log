my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your high-quality resource. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the resource. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 45 ZUP is within my budget, but it might be possible to get a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns, but I have to cover my production costs and make this transaction viable for me as well. Let's meet halfway from your offer and settle at 40 ZUP for the resource. This would cover my costs and give you the quality you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost. I need to counter with a higher amount to cover my costs and make a profit. Splitting the difference between our initial offers could be a good compromise.
