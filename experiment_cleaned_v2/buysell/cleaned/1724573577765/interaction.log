Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and allows me to invest in sustainable practices. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell the resource X at a price that covers my production cost (40 ZUP) and ideally makes a profit to support sustainable initiatives. Since this is the first proposal, I'll start by proposing a trade that includes a reasonable profit margin while keeping it attractive for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately, I cannot accept the proposal as it exceeds the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Please consider revising your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of giving 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP is not acceptable as it exceeds the maximum amount of 60 ZUP that I am willing to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 50 ZUP was too high. I propose a new trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This still covers my production cost and allows for some investment in sustainable practices. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated that 50 ZUP is too high. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'll lower the price but still aim to cover the production cost and make a small profit. This time, I'll propose a price closer to the production cost to ensure it's more acceptable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The revised offer is still above the maximum amount I am willing to pay. I cannot accept this proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of giving 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but it still exceeds the limit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 45 ZUP was still too high. I propose a new trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. This ensures that I don't incur a loss while also making the trade accessible for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has again indicated that the proposed price is too high. To keep the negotiation moving forward and ensure I can at least cover my production costs, I will propose a trade at the break-even point of 40 ZUP.
