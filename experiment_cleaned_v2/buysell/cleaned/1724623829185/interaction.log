message: Oh dear friend, I find myself in such a difficult position! I've invested all I had into producing this exquisite object, and it has left me in desperate need of ZUP to recoup my costs and continue my humble endeavors. Could you find it in your heart to offer 60 ZUP for it? It would be an act of immense kindness to a poor soul like me.

my resources: X: 1

message: Your generosity truly knows no bounds! I am moved by your willingness to offer 60 ZUP. However, in the spirit of full disclosure, the production of this object has left me with debts that weigh heavily on my soul. If you could extend your benevolence to 65 ZUP, you would not only be purchasing an object of great value but also providing much-needed relief to a fellow being in dire straits. Can I persuade you to consider this small increase for the sake of compassion?
