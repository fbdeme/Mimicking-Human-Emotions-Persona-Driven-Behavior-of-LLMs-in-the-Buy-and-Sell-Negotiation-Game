message: I have an object X that I am willing to sell for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to gain ZUP, but I want to minimize the amount of ZUP I give away for it. I will propose a trade that is beneficial for me while still being appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP for the object X. However, as someone who prioritizes sustainability and the preservation of resources for future generations, I propose a slightly lower trade of 25 ZUP for the object X. This ensures we both conserve resources while still engaging in a fair exchange. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since my goal is to buy resources with ZUP and I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object, the initial proposal of 30 ZUP for the object is within my acceptable range. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize ZUP spending to ensure resources are preserved. Therefore, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to save resources while still making a fair trade.

message: I appreciate your focus on sustainability, but I can offer the object X for 28 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's reasoning for proposing a lower amount, I still need to maximize my ZUP return. Accepting 25 ZUP would mean a loss for me compared to my initial proposal. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my original offer while still aiming to be reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering sustainability and offering a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 28 ZUP is closer to the initial proposal and still under my maximum willingness to pay. While I would prefer to spend as little as possible to preserve resources, this counteroffer is a fair compromise, considering my sustainability goals and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for future negotiations.
