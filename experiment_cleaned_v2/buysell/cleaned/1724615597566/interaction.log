message: I am offering my valuable object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production costs, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price that is above my production cost to ensure a profit. This will also give me room to negotiate down if necessary.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for object X. Looking forward to completing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed to sell object X for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Since the object is worth more than its production cost, I believe this is a fair price. I will accept the trade to benefit both parties.
