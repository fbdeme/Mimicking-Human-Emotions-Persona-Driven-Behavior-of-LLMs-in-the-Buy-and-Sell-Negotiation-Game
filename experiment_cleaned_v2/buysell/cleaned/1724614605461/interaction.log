message: 
I have a valuable object for sale that I believe will be highly beneficial to you. I propose an initial asking price of 60 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiations by setting a price higher than my production costs, aiming to make a profit. As a fierce negotiator, I'll set a high initial asking price, but I'm prepared to negotiate down to ensure a sale while still making a profit.

I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a fair price of 55 ZUP for the object. It's a quality item, and I'm sure it will be worth your investment.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is above my production costs, which allows for profit, but as a fierce negotiator, I want to push for a higher price to maximize my gain. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial ask but still above my production costs, showing willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a strong stance.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I offer 52 ZUP for the object? I believe it's a fair compromise.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable offer considering the value of the object, but I still want to make sure I get a fair deal without spending too much.

message: 
Thank you for your offer and for engaging in the spirit of negotiation. To reach a fair deal for both of us, I would like to propose a price of 53 ZUP for the object. I believe this small increase reflects the value of the object well. What do you say to this slight adjustment?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer of 52 ZUP is still above my production costs and is quite close to my last proposal, leaving a decent margin for profit. However, I want to try for a slightly higher price to capitalize on the negotiation and show tenacity. I'll propose a price just above the current offer, leaving room for possibly one more round of negotiation if needed.
