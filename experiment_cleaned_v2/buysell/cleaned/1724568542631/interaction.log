Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and gives me a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, as it costed 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start negotiations, I will propose a trade that covers my production cost and adds a small profit margin. This sets a reasonable anchor point.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. While 60 ZUP is within my budget, I would like to propose a trade of 50 ZUP for the object. This allows me to manage my resources better while still offering you a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED of 60 ZUP is the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, since I am a compassionate negotiator, I want to see if we can come to a more favorable agreement for both sides.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, you manage your resources well and I still get a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, as it costed 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is close to my initial ask but doesn't provide as much profit as I'd like. I will counter with 55 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. I accept the trade of 55 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 55 ZUP is reasonable and a good compromise. It is close to my maximum budget and ensures that Player RED still makes a profit.
