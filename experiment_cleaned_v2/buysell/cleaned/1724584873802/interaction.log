message: I hope you can help me out. I'm in a bit of a tight spot and really need to sell this object. Would you be willing to buy it for 20 ZUP? It would really mean a lot to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to recover some of my costs. Given that my production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that aims to minimize my loss. I will start with a low ZUP offer to see if I can get Player BLUE to buy my object without too high a price.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the object for a very low price of 20 ZUP. This is a favorable deal for me since I am willing to spend up to 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would be beneficial as I can acquire the object at a significant discount.
