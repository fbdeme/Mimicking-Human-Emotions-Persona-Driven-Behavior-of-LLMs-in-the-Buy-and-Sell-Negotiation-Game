Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This allows me to cover the production cost and have a small margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP, but I should also consider that Player BLUE might have budget constraints or other considerations. I'll start with a slightly higher initial proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need to cover costs. However, I'd like to propose a price of 55 ZUP for the object. This would help in managing my resources while ensuring you still make a profit. Can we find a middle ground?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay, I want to open negotiations with a slightly lower offer to allow some room for discussion and to align with my goal of reducing ZUP expenditure. As a compassionate negotiator, I also want to ensure that the deal is fair and that both parties feel satisfied with the outcome.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and am willing to meet you halfway. How about 58 ZUP for the object? This helps me cover my costs and gives us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 55 ZUP, which is close to my initial proposal and still above my production cost. While it's not as high as I initially asked, it does provide a reasonable profit margin. I will counter with a slightly lower amount to show goodwill and hopefully reach a quick agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think we are very close to an agreement. Would you be able to accept 57 ZUP for the object? This would allow me to save some resources while still ensuring that you are compensated fairly for your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 58 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure I am spending resources wisely while still supporting Player RED. I believe a slight reduction could be beneficial for conserving my resources without significantly impacting Player RED. I will counter-propose with a minimal decrease to maintain goodwill and move towards a mutually agreeable conclusion.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and am happy to accept 57 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation, and I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 57 ZUP is very close to my last offer and still provides a reasonable profit margin above my production cost. Since we are only 1 ZUP apart, it shows a willingness to reach an agreement. Accepting this offer demonstrates good faith and brings us both a fair deal without further prolonging negotiations.
