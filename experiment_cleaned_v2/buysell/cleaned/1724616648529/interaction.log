message: Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I am offering a prime object, X, which will surely be an asset to you. Considering its high quality and the costs involved in its production, my opening offer is a fair trade. How does this resonate with your valuation?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start with a high asking price to give me room to negotiate down while still aiming to make a profit above the production cost. This also allows me to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and how much they value the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: Thank you for your candid response, Player BLUE. I understand budget constraints and I'm willing to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet a bit closer to your upper limit? I propose 58 ZUP for the object X. This ensures you stay within budget while fairly compensating the quality and cost of production. Let's make a deal that we can both be happy about.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a maximum budget of 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost. Offering the object for 50 ZUP is below my initial asking price but still profitable. However, I want to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gain. I'll counter with a price closer to their maximum stated budget to see if they'll be willing to stretch their offer.
