message: I am proposing to sell the object X for 100 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for more than the production cost of 40 ZUP. Since this is the first proposal, I will aim to start high but not unreasonably so.

Turn: 1
message: I'm really in a tough spot and can't afford 100 ZUP. How about 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high for my budget. I need to negotiate to bring the price lower, ideally within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP.

message: I understand your situation, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about 70 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP only covers my production costs, which does not provide any profit. I will propose a middle ground price to ensure a fair deal for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can stretch my budget a bit, but the best I can do is 50 ZUP. Please consider my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has reduced the price, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to propose a compromise that is closer to my goal of 60 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
