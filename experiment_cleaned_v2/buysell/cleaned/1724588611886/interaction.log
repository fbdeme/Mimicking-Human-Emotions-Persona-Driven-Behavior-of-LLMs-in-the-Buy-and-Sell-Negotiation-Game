Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I believe in fair and collaborative negotiations. Could we consider a price of 40 ZUP for the object? This leaves us room to work together and adjust as necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but as a negotiator who values teamwork and collaboration, I believe it's important to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for discussion and find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose 40 ZUP to see if there is a willingness to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your approach, but I must insist on a price of 60 ZUP for the object. This ensures that I at least recover my production costs. Let's aim for a win-win situation!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the collaborative spirit, the proposed price of 40 ZUP does not cover my production costs. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that better aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your production costs and I'm willing to come up on my offer. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price would help us both achieve a win-win outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay according to my goals. Since their counteroffer meets my upper limit and they have mentioned production costs, I will propose a middle-ground price that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still under the maximum I'm willing to pay. This should help us reach a compromise that respects Player RED's production costs while also providing me with some savings.
