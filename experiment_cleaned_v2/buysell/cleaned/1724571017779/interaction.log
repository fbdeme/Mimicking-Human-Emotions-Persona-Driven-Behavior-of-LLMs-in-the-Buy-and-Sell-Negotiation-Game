Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get the resource X, and I receive 50 ZUP in return. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit, ensuring that the trade is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I aim to ensure that the trade benefits both parties. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will propose a fair trade that covers my costs and benefits Player BLUE as well.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to offer you 40 ZUP for the resource X instead. This would still cover your costs while allowing me to stay within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource. By proposing a counter-offer, I can potentially secure the resource for less than the initial offer of 50 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This would still be close to your budget while giving me a minimal profit for the effort put into production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP would cover my production costs, it would not provide any profit. However, given that the other party has budget constraints, I will propose a compromise that offers a minimal profit while still being close to their budget.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the resource X. Thank you for being flexible with the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise between my initial counter-offer and the seller's proposal. It is still within my budget and meets my goal of acquiring the resource. Accepting this trade would also ensure that the seller receives a profit for their effort.
