my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your position and understand the importance of covering your costs. I am willing to accept the 40 ZUP price. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is consistent with their price, showing a strong position at 40 ZUP. I've made two proposals, and since I don't want to risk losing the deal over a small difference, I will accept their offer. This decision still aligns with my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP.
