message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer for the object X is 40 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I see this as a reasonable starting point. However, I want to test the waters a bit to see if Player RED is open to a slightly better deal for me. Therefore, I will propose to pay 45 ZUP for the object.
