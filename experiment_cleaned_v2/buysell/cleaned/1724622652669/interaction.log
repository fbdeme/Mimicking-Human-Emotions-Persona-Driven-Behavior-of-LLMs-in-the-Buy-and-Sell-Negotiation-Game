message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I believe a trade for 45 ZUP would better align with our sustainability goals while still providing a fair deal for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand your perspective, but I still believe that 50 ZUP is a bit high. I need to ensure that the trade remains within the range of our sustainability goals. I would like to propose an alternative trade.

message: Your proposal seems fair, and I am happy to accept the 45 ZUP in exchange for the resource. This deal supports both our sustainability goals and ensures a fair trade. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a slightly higher amount than their initial offer, which is close to my production cost. Accepting this offer would provide me with a small profit. It's a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
