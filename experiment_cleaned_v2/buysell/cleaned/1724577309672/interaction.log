my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a starting proposal, I'm offering a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay, which allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a better deal. Additionally, proposing 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X tests the seller's flexibility and their potential bottom line without revealing my maximum willingness to pay.

reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still under the threshold.

This tactic could potentially lead to an agreement that is more favorable to me, without reaching my maximum limit.
