player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 40 ZUP, which is lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price for myself. Since I have more resources, I can propose to pay slightly more, indicating my interest while still aiming for a lower price.
