Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial proposal with 36 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the counter-offer from Player RED is slightly higher than my first proposal, it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to keep the negotiation collaborative and make progress towards a deal. However, I will attempt one more proposal to save some ZUP while moving closer to Player RED's offer to show cooperation and willingness to close the deal.
