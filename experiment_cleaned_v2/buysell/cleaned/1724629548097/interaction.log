message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering my high-quality object X for 50 ZUP. This object has been meticulously crafted and represents a good value for the price. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set the price slightly above my production costs to ensure some profit, but not too high to avoid scaring off Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives me a margin, but is still within a reasonable range for negotiation.

message: 
Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the object you're selling and appreciate your craftsmanship. However, to make this deal more equitable and to foster a positive trading relationship for potential future deals, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this adjusted offer still reflects the value of your work while allowing us to conserve resources for the prosperity of both parties.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as a skilled negotiator, my goal is to reduce the ZUP expenditure as much as possible while still reaching an agreement. I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price that is more favorable to me, but still within a reasonable range, to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the situation and the future relationship. In the spirit of compromise and with respect to the quality of the object, I am willing to lower my asking price slightly. Let's meet halfway and agree on 48 ZUP for the object. This adjustment ensures that both of us benefit from the trade, and it sets a foundation for a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer and the effort to establish a positive trading relationship. However, I still aim to make a profit above my production costs. I'm willing to come down a little on the price to show my willingness to negotiate, but not as low as 45 ZUP. A counteroffer of 48 ZUP would still give me a decent profit margin while showing flexibility in the negotiation.

Player RED, I am grateful for your willingness to adjust your price and for recognizing the value of a long-term partnership. In keeping with our spirit of compromise, I would like to propose a price of 46 ZUP for the object. This price represents a further step toward meeting in the middle and honors the quality of your offering while maintaining a sustainable reserve of ZUP for future endeavors we may embark on together.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has responded positively to the negotiation and has come down on the price to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise and demonstrates respect for the future trading relationship. I believe there is still room for a slight adjustment to align the trade more closely with my goal of conserving resources. I will make another counteroffer that is a little higher than my last proposal, but still below Player RED's latest offer, to keep the negotiation moving forward in good faith.

message: Player BLUE, I acknowledge and appreciate your fair proposal of 46 ZUP for the object. I accept this offer as it respects the value of the object and fosters our potential for a long-term partnership. I am pleased to proceed with this trade and look forward to future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to my initial asking price, and their offer of 46 ZUP is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. I want to close the deal without prolonging the negotiation too much, as this could lead to impasse or breakdown in talks. Accepting 46 ZUP would still meet my goal of making a profit, and it would foster goodwill for any future negotiations with Player BLUE.
