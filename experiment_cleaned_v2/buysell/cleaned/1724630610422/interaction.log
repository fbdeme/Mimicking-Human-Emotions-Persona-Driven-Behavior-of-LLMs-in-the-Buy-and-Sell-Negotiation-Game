message: I'm offering a high-quality object for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a strategic negotiator, I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my costs to ensure room for negotiation and to aim for a profitable transaction. I will propose a trade that gives me a return on my investment, but I'm prepared to adjust based on Player BLUE's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I see the value in the object you're selling, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This price still respects the quality and cost of production while being a bit more aligned with my purchasing goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As per my goals, I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. However, the initial proposal by Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation and leaves some room to potentially get a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your purchasing goals. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price reflects the quality and gives us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to aim for a higher profit margin while remaining open to negotiation. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my original asking price and their counter-offer, maintaining a stance for a profitable sale but showing willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards a price that suits us both. I'd like to counter with 46 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair compromise between our initial offers and still offers you a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counter-offer and still under the maximum I am willing to pay. However, there is still a small margin for negotiation. I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if we can settle on a value that is more favorable to me but still acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your compromise. I propose 47 ZUP as a final adjustment, which I believe honors the value of the object and provides a fair profit for the production costs. This is a strong offer, and I hope it meets your approval.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is closer to my target. Since this is my third proposal, I want to get as close to my desired profit margin as possible without risking the deal. I will propose a slight increase, indicating my final move towards closing the deal.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I accept the offer of 47 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal that respects the value of the object and our respective goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is 47 ZUP, which is just one ZUP above my last proposal and well within the range I'm willing to pay. It's a fair compromise, and since it's close to my target price and respects my purchasing goals, I'm inclined to accept the offer to ensure the trade is successful and beneficial for both parties.
