message: Let's start the negotiation. I have a high-quality object for you, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking for a fair profit margin and propose a trade where you give me 60 ZUP in exchange for this object. I assure you, the value you get exceeds the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'm aiming high initially to gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to spend ZUP and leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the proposed price of 60 ZUP is higher than what I am willing to pay. I will propose a lower amount to maximize my resources while still making a fair offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but simply breaking even is not in my business interests. I've adjusted my initial proposal to 50 ZUP, which is a compromise between your offer and my initial asking price. This price still provides excellent value for the quality of the object you'll be receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. I aim to assert dominance and secure a profit, so I will counter with a slightly reduced offer from my initial proposal but still above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your compromise, but I would like to propose an even lower price of 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 50 ZUP is closer to what I am willing to pay, but it still exceeds my budget. I need to negotiate further down to ensure I stay within my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I recognize your budget constraints and appreciate your new offer. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a fair price of 48 ZUP for the object. This price reflects a balance between your budget and my need to maintain a profitable business. It's a strong compromise that respects both of our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While Player BLUE has increased their offer, it is still close to my production cost and only provides a minimal profit. I want to maintain a strong position in this negotiation and push for a higher price. I will propose a price that splits the difference between their offer and my last proposal, which should seem like a reasonable compromise while still asserting my negotiating strength.
