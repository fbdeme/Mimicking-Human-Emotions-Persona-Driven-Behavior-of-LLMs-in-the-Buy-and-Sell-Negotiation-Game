message: I'm offering the object X for 100 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the costs involved in production and the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to maximize profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the object, but 100 ZUP is beyond my current budget. I can offer 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is too high given my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to start the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. To make it worthwhile, I propose 70 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposal of 40 ZUP barely covers my production cost, leaving no room for profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure some profit while being mindful of the other player's budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but 70 ZUP is still too high for me. I can stretch my budget a bit and offer 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will make a counteroffer closer to my budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit. How about we settle at 60 ZUP for the object?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 50 ZUP provides a minimal profit margin. While it's not ideal, itâ€™s a compromise. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal.
