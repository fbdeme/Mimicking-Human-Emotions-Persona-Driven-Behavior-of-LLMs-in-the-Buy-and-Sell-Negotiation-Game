message: I am offering to sell you 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production cost and ensures a reasonable profit. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I at least cover my production costs and make a profit on the sale.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I'm working within a tight budget. Would you consider a slight reduction? How about 1 unit of X for 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay, I'd like to propose a slightly lower trade to see if there's any room for negotiation. However, I must be cautious not to propose too low of an amount as it might lead to a rejection and end the game. A modest decrease in the proposed ZUP amount might show willingness to negotiate and possibly lead to an agreement that is more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. Let's meet halfway at 58 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP still covers my production cost and provides a profit, I want to negotiate a bit more to maximize my profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise. Meeting halfway is fair, but I was hoping for just a bit more leeway. Could we agree on 56 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would help me manage my expenses better while still giving you a profitable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from RED is reasonable and quite close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to get a better deal without risking the transaction. I will propose a slightly lower amount to push for the best possible price within my set limit. It's important to leave some room for negotiation and not reach my maximum willingness to pay just yet.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. 1 unit of X for 56 ZUP. Let's finalize the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 56 ZUP is only slightly lower than my counteroffer, it still ensures a decent profit margin. I will accept this to close the deal efficiently.
