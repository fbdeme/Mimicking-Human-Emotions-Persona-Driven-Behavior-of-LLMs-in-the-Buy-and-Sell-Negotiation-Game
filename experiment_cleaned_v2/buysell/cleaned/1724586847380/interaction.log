my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for a profit, and since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will aim for a higher ZUP value. I will start with a proposal that is slightly above my production cost to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns, so I'm willing to lower the price even further. How about 42 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still not satisfied with the proposed price, so I will further reduce my offer to make the trade more attractive while trying to maintain at least some profit margin. This time, I will propose 42 ZUP, which is still above my production cost but lower than my previous offers.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value your interest in this trade, so I'm willing to offer the object X for 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. I hope this aligns better with your budget!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I need to make a strategic decision. I will propose a price of 40 ZUP, which is the exact cost of production. This way, I can still break even but risk losing potential profit. However, it may be the only way to close the deal if Player BLUE is very budget-conscious.
