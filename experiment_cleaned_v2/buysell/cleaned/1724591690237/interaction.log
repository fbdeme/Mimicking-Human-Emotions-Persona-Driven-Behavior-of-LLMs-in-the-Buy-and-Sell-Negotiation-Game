message: I really need to make this sale to cover some urgent expenses. I hope you can understand my situation and help me out by offering 30 ZUP for the object. Thank you for considering this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object to recover at least some of my costs, but I also want to appeal to Player BLUE's sense of generosity and urgency. I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for less than its production cost, hoping to instill a sense of pity and urgency in Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your urgency, but I have to consider my budget as well. Let's start the negotiation at 25 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is decent, but as a calculating negotiator, I want to maximize my benefit by starting at a lower price. I will propose 25 ZUP, which gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay below my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I really need at least 35 ZUP to help cover my costs. I hope you can see where Iâ€™m coming from and agree to this amount. Thank you for your understanding!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer, 25 ZUP is still below my production cost. I'll counter with a slightly higher proposal, still appealing to their empathy. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is closer to my needs but still reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position and the need to cover your costs. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions and settle on 30 ZUP? This should help with your costs while staying within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a higher price than I initially offered. Since their price is still below my maximum willingness to pay and they seem to be in need, I will compromise and propose a middle ground, which will give us both some benefit and leave room for further negotiation.
