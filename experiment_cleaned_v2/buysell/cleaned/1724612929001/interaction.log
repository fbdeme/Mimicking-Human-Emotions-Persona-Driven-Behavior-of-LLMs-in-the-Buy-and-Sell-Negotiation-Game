message: I have a high-quality object that may be of interest to you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a starting trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for the item. Let's discuss and find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While 50 ZUP is reasonable, considering my current budget constraints, I propose 30 ZUP for the object. I believe this amount reflects a fair trade-off between value and cost. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is fair but there is potential to negotiate for a better deal. Offering a lower price to start negotiations can leave room for compromise.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget constraints, so let's meet halfway. Iâ€™m willing to reduce the price to 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost but more accessible for you. I believe this is a fair compromise for both sides. Shall we proceed with this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to cover costs and ideally make a profit. I will propose a compromise that is above my production cost but still offers a discount from my initial offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposal. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To continue our negotiation, how about we settle at 35 ZUP for the object? This figure balances both of our interests and moves us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but there's still room to negotiate a better deal. By proposing an amount slightly higher than my original offer but lower than 45, I can aim for a better price while showing flexibility.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and your latest offer. To move closer to a deal, I propose a price of 42 ZUP. This covers my production costs and ensures the deal is sustainable for me, while also considering your budget. I hope this amount is a workable solution for us both. Are we ready to finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production costs. However, I want to continue negotiating and reach an agreement that is as close to my costs as possible, yet also respects the constraints of Player BLUE. I will propose a price that covers my production costs and leaves a slim margin for profit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. Your proposal of 42 ZUP is reasonable. To find a middle ground, I propose 38 ZUP for the object. I believe this amount respects both our positions and brings us closer to a satisfactory agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 42 ZUP is reasonable, and well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, to ensure the best possible deal, I can make one final counter-offer closer to the middle ground between 35 and 42.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of finding a middle ground. As my final proposal, I offer the object for 40 ZUP, which matches my production cost. This ensures fairness for both of us while allowing me to sustain my operations. I hope we can agree on this and make a successful transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is lower than my desired price, but it is very close to my production cost. This will be my last proposal, and to ensure a deal is made, I will offer a final price that slightly exceeds my costs, leaving room for a minimal profit. This should be a fair and appealing offer to close the negotiation.
