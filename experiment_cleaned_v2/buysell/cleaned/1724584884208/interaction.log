Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're in a tough spot, and I want to help you out. How about I give you 15 ZUP for the object instead? It’s a fair offer considering the circumstances!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which gives me leverage. I can negotiate a better price while also playing on the seller's urgency, but I will counter to lower the price even further.
