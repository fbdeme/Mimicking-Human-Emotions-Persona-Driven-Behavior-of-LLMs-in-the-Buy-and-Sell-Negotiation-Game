message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure will be valuable to you. Considering the costs and the quality, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's make a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a strategic negotiator, my initial proposal should aim high to give room for negotiation, but not so high as to discourage Player BLUE from countering. I want to recover my production costs and make a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your quick response and the willingness to trade at cost, but I'm sure you understand the need for a small profit margin to sustain business. How about meeting halfway between our proposals? I propose 1 X for 45 ZUP. This allows for a fair profit for me while still offering you the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. As a strategic negotiator, I should counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit, yet still within a range that could be acceptable to Player BLUE.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding the importance of a profitable transaction. Your offer of 42 ZUP is close to what I need. To facilitate our deal and reflect my commitment to a fair trade, I propose a small adjustment to 43 ZUP for 1 X. This should cover my costs and provide a modest profit, ensuring future business opportunities for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now above my production cost. However, I should aim to maximize my profit while the negotiation is ongoing. I will counter with a slightly higher price, but not as high as my last proposal to show willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit and your commitment to a fair trade. However, I believe 41 ZUP for 1 X is the most reasonable offer considering the quality and cost. Let's finalize our agreement with this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the adjustment, but I still believe 43 ZUP is a bit high. I will counter with a final trade offer of 1 X for 41 ZUP to ensure a fair price for both of us.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 41 ZUP for 1 X is acceptable, and I'm pleased we could find common ground. I look forward to future dealings with you. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP gives me a narrow profit margin. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I must make a decision that either brings us to an agreement or leaves room for acceptance in their next proposal. Given that 41 ZUP is a reasonable offer, I will accept it to ensure a guaranteed profit and successful trade.
