player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that will allow me to recover my costs while making it appealing to Player BLUE. I will start by asking for a reasonable amount of ZUP that is less than the cost to produce the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Given the current market conditions and the value of the object X, I propose to buy it for 20 ZUP. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to spend as little as possible. By countering with a lower offer, I can test if Player RED is willing to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer, but I can only sell the object for 35 ZUP. This is closer to my production cost. Let me know if you can agree to this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer from Player BLUE, 20 ZUP is significantly below the cost I incurred to produce the object. I need to counter with a higher offer to recover my costs effectively.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 25 ZUP is a fair price considering the market conditions. Please let me know if we can settle on this amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I aim to secure the best possible deal. By proposing 25 ZUP, I can see if Player RED is flexible and willing to settle at a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can only sell the object for 32 ZUP. I hope we can come to an agreement on this amount!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I acknowledge the offer of 25 ZUP, it is still too low for me to recover my costs. I will counter one last time before deciding whether to accept or reject. My goal is to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer. I believe 28 ZUP is a reasonable price for the object X given the current market conditions. I hope we can agree on this amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 32 ZUP is still acceptable, but my goal is to secure the best possible deal. By proposing 28 ZUP, I am testing if there is still room for negotiation and to push the price closer to my target.
