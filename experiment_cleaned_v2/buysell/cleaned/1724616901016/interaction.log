Hey there! I've been in a tight spot lately, and I really need to sell this item to cover some urgent expenses. It's high-quality and cost me a lot to produce, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I hope we can work something out that's good for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade that's slightly higher than my production costs to open up the negotiation. I want to appear somewhat desperate to sell, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to propose a trade that's still favorable to me but closer to my actual costs. Offering a higher starting price gives me room to negotiate downward while still aiming to cover my costs and possibly make a small profit.

Thank you for your offer! I'm really in a bind and need to make this sale happen soon. Your offer is very generous, but I'm willing to go a bit lower to 45 ZUP to ensure a quick deal. I hope this adjustment shows you how important it is for me to sell right now.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since Player BLUE has proposed the same amount I initially asked for, it seems they believe this is a fair trade. However, to maintain my strategy of appearing desperate, I will slightly reduce my asking price to give the illusion of urgency and need for a quick sale. This may prompt Player BLUE to accept the trade quickly, securing me a sale that's still above my production costs.
