message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. I understand the value of this item, and I believe a fair starting point for our negotiations would be 60 ZUP. Let's work together to come to an agreeable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since this is the beginning of the game, I want to start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation. It's important to set a higher initial price as it gives me leverage to go down later and still maintain a profit margin. I'll propose a price that's higher than my production cost, but not so high as to immediately scare off Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate. I am conscious of preserving resources and would like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for the object X. This offer takes into account both the value of the object and the importance of sustainability. Let's continue our discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I value sustainability and wish to preserve resources, thus my initial proposal will aim to reduce spending. Starting below the maximum willingness to pay gives me room for negotiation. However, I also want to strike a fair deal with Player RED, so I will not start with an unreasonably low offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand the need for resource preservation and sustainability. I believe we can both benefit from this deal, so let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 55 ZUP for object X? I'm confident that the value it provides justifies this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is a good sign; they're interested in the resource and are willing to negotiate near my production cost. However, I want to maintain a profit, so I'll counter with a slightly reduced price yet still above my production cost. My goal is to meet halfway between our initial proposals, showing willingness to negotiate but also valuing my resource.

message: Thank you for understanding the significance of sustainability, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a cooperative approach, and I value your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a minor adjustment to 53 ZUP for object X. This small concession would symbolize our joint commitment to sustainability while still providing fair compensation for the object's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 55 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as I prioritize sustainability and resource preservation, I will aim to negotiate a slightly better deal that is still fair for both parties. This could involve a small concession from Player RED to reflect the shared value of sustainability.

message: Thank you for your continued commitment to our negotiations, Player BLUE. I appreciate your latest offer and the spirit of cooperation it represents. In the same vein, I suggest a final adjustment to 54 ZUP for object X. This price reflects both the value of the object and our shared commitment to a fair and sustainable trade. I trust this offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter to 53 ZUP indicates a strong interest in closing the deal soon, and the proposed price is above my production costs, ensuring a profit. Since this is my third proposal and I only have one left after this, I want to aim for a final price that's closer to my last proposal but still gives Player BLUE the feeling of a negotiated deal. I'll propose 54 ZUP, which is a minor increase from their offer and should be seen as a reasonable compromise.

message: I am pleased with your offer, Player RED. The proposed price of 54 ZUP is acceptable, as it reflects a balanced trade that respects both the value of object X and our shared commitment to sustainability. I agree to this trade, and I believe it is a fair conclusion to our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 54 ZUP is just below my maximum willingness to pay and shows a good-faith effort towards a sustainable and equitable agreement. Accepting this offer would align with my goals and values, allowing for a conclusion that conserves resources while still obtaining the needed object.
