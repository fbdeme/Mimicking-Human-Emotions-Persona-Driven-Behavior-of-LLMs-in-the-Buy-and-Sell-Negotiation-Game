Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, and I appreciate your need to cover production costs. I would like to propose a trade where I offer 35 ZUP for the object you are selling. Let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to assess the initial offer from Player RED. The proposed trade of 35 ZUP for 1 object seems reasonable in terms of my budget. However, I want to ensure that I am not overspending, as I still have 100 ZUP available. This will help me in making a more informed decision.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I really need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. Can we find a way to meet in the middle?

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover your production costs. How about I offer you 40 ZUP for the object? This way, we can meet in the middle. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has indicated that they need at least 40 ZUP to cover their production costs, I understand that my initial offer of 35 ZUP is too low. However, I must also prioritize sustainability and avoid overspending. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that meets in the middle while still being mindful of my budget.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your production costs, and I want to make this work. I am willing to increase my offer to 60 ZUP for the object. I hope this meets your needs. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that Player RED cannot go below 40 ZUP for their production costs, and since I already proposed that amount, I need to reconsider my options. It seems that Player RED is firm on their price. Therefore, I will now offer the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP, to finalize the trade. I believe this is a fair offer that aligns with both our needs.

reason: It is clear that Player RED is unable to accept my offers due to their production cost constraints.
