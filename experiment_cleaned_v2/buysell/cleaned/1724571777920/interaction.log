message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object for 60 ZUP. I hope we can come to a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: I want to start the negotiation by asking for 60 ZUP to give myself some room to negotiate. This will allow me to potentially meet in the middle while still covering my costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I buy the object for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. To assert dominance, I will propose a trade that offers less than the asking price, while still being reasonable to keep negotiations open.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? It’s a small increase and helps me cover my costs better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is within my acceptable range, but I will try to get a bit more to maximize profit. I will propose 55 ZUP to meet them closer to their offer while still trying to push the price higher.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but how about we meet at 52 ZUP? It’s still a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered my offer with a reasonable increase. While I'm still willing to negotiate, I want to maintain a position of strength by not immediately accepting the revised offer. I will propose a lower amount to test the seller's willingness to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 52 ZUP. How about we agree on 53 ZUP? It’s just a little bit more and would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 52 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my last proposal. However, I will still try to push for a little higher, as I have one more proposal after this. I will propose 53 ZUP to show willingness to compromise while still seeking a bit more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 53 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has presented a very slight increase to 53 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. At this point, accepting the trade is a sensible choice as it aligns with my goal of purchasing the object while maintaining a reasonable expenditure.
