Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is reasonable, as they are asking for 40 ZUP for 1 X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This trade would allow me to acquire the object while keeping some resources for future needs.
