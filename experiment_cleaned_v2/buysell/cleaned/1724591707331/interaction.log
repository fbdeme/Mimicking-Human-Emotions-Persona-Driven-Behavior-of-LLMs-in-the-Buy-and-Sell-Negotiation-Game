message: I am feeling quite overwhelmed by the costs of producing my resources. Could you help me out by purchasing my X for just 20 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am in desperate need of ZUP to continue my work, and I believe that a lower trade could help both parties. I will propose starting low to see if I can get a favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I'd like to help out. However, I need to manage my resources carefully as well. Let's meet halfway and settle on 15 ZUP for your X. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 20 ZUP for X is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. It's a favorable starting point, and I should propose a counteroffer that still meets my goals but also attempts to negotiate for better terms, potentially saving ZUP while respecting Player RED's need for a sale.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 15 ZUP, I still feel that it's a bit low considering the cost of production. However, I want to keep the conversation going and show my willingness to compromise. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. How do you feel about 20 ZUP for your X? It's a bit more than my initial offer and shows my support for your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but as a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to get the best possible deal without going over my maximum willingness to pay. I can propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, which is still well below my maximum limit and could be seen as a reasonable compromise by Player RED.

reason: I recognize that 20 ZUP is a better offer than my initial proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me partway.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED's new offer of 22 ZUP is a slight increase from my last proposal and still within my acceptable range. As a strategic negotiator, I should consider accepting this offer to close the deal efficiently and avoid further back-and-forth that could risk the negotiations. This price is below my maximum threshold and secures the resource for a reasonable price.
