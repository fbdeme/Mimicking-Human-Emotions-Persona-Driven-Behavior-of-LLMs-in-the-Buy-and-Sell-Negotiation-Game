my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs

message: Thank you for your offer. Let's meet in the middle at 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer is 45 ZUP, which is still lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's closer to my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate further for an even better deal, given that I still have room to negotiate within my limit.

message: I understand your position. How about we finalize the deal at 43 ZUP? This would ensure at least a small profit for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 43 ZUP is acceptable as it is below my maximum willingness to pay. It also appears that the seller is eager to close the deal, which gives me an advantage. I should consider accepting this offer to secure the object while still saving ZUP.
