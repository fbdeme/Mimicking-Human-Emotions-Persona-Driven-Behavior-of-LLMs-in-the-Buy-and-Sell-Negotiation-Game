Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 40 ZUP is your cost of production. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the object, which is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Would you consider this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am considering the initial offer from Player RED and will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but within the range I am willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potential agreement that meets my goal of paying less than the maximum amount I am willing to spend.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can offer the object for 38 ZUP. This way, I can cover a portion of my production costs while still providing you with a discount. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your counteroffer of 35 ZUP, it is below my production cost, and I would still prefer to recover at least part of my investment. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly lower than my original but still closer to my cost.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you agree to 36 ZUP for the object? This price would allow me to stay within my budget while also giving you a return on your production costs. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. I should further negotiate to get closer to my target price, but also show willingness to move towards an agreement. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my first offer, yet still below Player RED's asking price.
