Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair price that compensates for the costs and provides a reasonable profit. Would you consider 50 ZUP a fair trade for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. I don't want to set the initial price too high to avoid discouraging Player BLUE. However, it should be high enough to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for the object, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand the value of the object, but I feel that 50 ZUP is a bit high for my current budget. I want to make this trade work, but I also want to ensure that I am spending wisely, especially since I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. Perhaps we can negotiate a little more to find a middle ground?

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and I appreciate your offer to cover the production costs. However, I do need to make a slight profit to sustain my business. Could we meet halfway at 45 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production for the item. While this would allow me to break even, I am aiming to make a profit. However, I must also consider the possibility of Player BLUE's budget constraints. I will propose a slightly higher amount to achieve some profit while still being close to Player BLUE's offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my budget concerns. How about we settle on 42 ZUP for the object? I believe it would still be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I can see that you are trying to compromise, and I truly appreciate that. However, 45 ZUP is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I want to make this trade happen and I hope we can find a way to make it work for both of us. Would you be open to considering a price of 42 ZUP? It would really help me out in my current situation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your negotiation. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. I believe this is indeed a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly from their initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. The offer of 42 ZUP allows for a small profit, albeit less than desired. However, it is close to my last proposal and might be the best compromise to ensure a sale. I will accept this offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.
