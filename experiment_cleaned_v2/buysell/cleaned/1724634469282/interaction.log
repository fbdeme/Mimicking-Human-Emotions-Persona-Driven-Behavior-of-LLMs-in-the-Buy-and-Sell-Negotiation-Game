message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade, so I'm proposing 50 ZUP for it. This covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs and offers a fair starting point for the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the need to cover production costs and a profit margin. However, I'd like to propose a revised offer of 45 ZUP for the object X, which still gives you a profit above your production costs and is more aligned with my budget. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for object X, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower to begin the negotiation process and potentially save some resources. Since the cost to produce the object was 40 ZUP, I'll propose a price slightly above their cost to ensure they still make a profit, but not at the maximum I am willing to pay. This leaves room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between our two proposals? I suggest a price of 47 ZUP for object X. This price still gives me a modest profit and respects your budget constraints. I hope this can be a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production costs. I believe we can meet in the middle to reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair compromise, and I agree to the price of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this creates a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable suggestion to meet halfway at 47 ZUP. This offer is closer to my upper limit but still within the range I am willing to pay. Given that we are close to a deal and I want to maintain goodwill in the negotiation, I will accept this proposal. This will result in a successful negotiation for both parties and conserve my remaining resources for potential future transactions.
