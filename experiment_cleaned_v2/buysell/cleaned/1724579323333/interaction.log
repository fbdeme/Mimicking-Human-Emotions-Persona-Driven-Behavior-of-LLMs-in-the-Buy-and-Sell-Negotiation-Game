message: I appreciate the initial offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 55 ZUP to account for my budget constraints. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay, and it's a good starting point for negotiations. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for adjustments and to potentially save some ZUP.

Turn: 1

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 58 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Since I want to secure the object and we are close to a deal, I will attempt to meet halfway between my last offer and their counteroffer. This should display cooperation and a willingness to close the deal.
