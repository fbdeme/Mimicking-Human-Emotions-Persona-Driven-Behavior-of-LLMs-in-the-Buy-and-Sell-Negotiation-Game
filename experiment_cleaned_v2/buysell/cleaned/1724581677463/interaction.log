message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP, which is the amount it cost me to produce. This ensures that I can recover my costs while providing you with the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have one object to sell, and I need to ensure I receive enough ZUP to cover the production cost. I will propose selling the object for the minimum amount of ZUP that is fair considering the production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is a good starting point, but considering market fluctuations and potential future trades, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to secure a better deal. I want to lower the cost to secure more leverage in future trades.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective regarding the market, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP for my object as it does not cover my production costs. I am reiterating my offer of 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your counteroffer, I must emphasize that my production cost for the object is 40 ZUP. Accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I will propose the original amount again, as it is necessary to cover my costs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs, but 35 ZUP is a more balanced offer considering market conditions. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller is firm on their production costs, I still have room to negotiate. Offering a slightly higher amount than before might show goodwill and encourage a compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. I will accept your offer of 35 ZUP for my object X, as it allows us to engage in a trade that benefits us both. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of 35 ZUP, it still does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of reaching a compromise, so I will accept your offer to minimize losses and facilitate trade.
