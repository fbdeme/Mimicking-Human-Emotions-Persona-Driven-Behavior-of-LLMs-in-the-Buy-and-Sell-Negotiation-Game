message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that values my object at 40 ZUP, which is its production cost, and I will aim for a fair exchange. I want to ensure that I cover my costs while also making it appealing for Player BLUE to accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose buying the object X for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This means I can afford the trade without compromising my resources significantly. However, I want to ensure that we are both getting a fair deal, so I will propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me while still being reasonable.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your proposal, but I can offer you the object X for 35 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I will counter with a trade offer of 35 ZUP, which is a middle ground that slightly reduces my losses while still being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my initial proposal of 30 ZUP, and it is still within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would mean I still have sufficient resources left for future needs, while also securing the object X at a reasonable price. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
