message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 50 ZUP. This is a good deal considering the production cost. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to maximize my ZUP return from selling the object X, while also ensuring that I am making a profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start with a proposal that is reasonable and gives Player BLUE a chance to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the production costs involved. As a community-minded individual, I aim to conserve resources for the benefit of all. Could we consider adjusting the price to 45 ZUP to ensure we both can continue to contribute to our community effectively?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, as a community-minded negotiator, I believe in collective success and minimizing the ZUP spent. Thus, I will propose a slightly lower amount with the intent to save resources, which could be beneficial for future collective endeavors.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer! How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This way, we both contribute effectively to our community while also ensuring a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's community-minded approach, accepting a price of 45 ZUP would still yield a profit, as it exceeds the production cost. However, I believe I should counter their proposal to maximize my return. I will propose a price that is closer to my original offer, while still being reasonable for negotiation.

message: Thank you for understanding the importance of a fair trade and effective contribution to our community. I propose a compromise at 46 ZUP for the object X. This price respects your production costs while also preserving our community resources. Let's work together for the greater good!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, in keeping with my community-minded approach and aiming for a fair trade that saves resources, I will make a final counterproposal that is closer to my initial offer but still provides a compromise for Player RED.
