message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. However, to reflect the quality and value of the resource, and considering the production costs, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP. This price point allows me to sustain my operations while providing you with a valuable asset.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, but since my goal is to make a profit, I want to negotiate a higher price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost, aiming for a compromise that ensures profit. I'll propose 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player RED. Iâ€™m willing to meet you halfway and offer 50 ZUP for the resource. How does that sound?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is an improvement from my previous offer of 40 ZUP. While it is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, I need to consider if I want to accept this offer or negotiate further. I will propose an amount close to my limit to see if Player RED is willing to accept a better deal for both of us.
