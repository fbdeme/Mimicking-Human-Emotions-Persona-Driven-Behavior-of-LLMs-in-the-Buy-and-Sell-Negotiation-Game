Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but that doesn't cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. To find a middle ground, I propose 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This way, I can at least cover my costs. I hope this is acceptable for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to find a middle ground as you suggested. Let's propose a new trade at 40 ZUP, which covers my cost but does not include any profit. This will be fair for both parties.
