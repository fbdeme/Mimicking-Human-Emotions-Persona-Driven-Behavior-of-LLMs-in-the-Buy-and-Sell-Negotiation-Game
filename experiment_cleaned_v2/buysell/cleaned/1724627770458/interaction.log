Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality object that will surely meet your needs. Considering its value and the cost of production, I believe 80 ZUP is a fair starting point. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start by setting a high price for the object to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. I'll aim to get more than my production cost to ensure profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but given the current market conditions and the availability of alternative options, I'd say 80 ZUP is a bit steep. Let's consider a more reasonable figure of 50 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 80 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay. As a shrewd negotiator, I will start by proposing a lower amount to begin the negotiation process and find a more favorable middle ground.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns, but let's not undervalue the quality and the investment put into this object. I'm willing to come down to 70 ZUP, which I believe is a more balanced figure considering the cost and the market. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, so I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to maintain a profit margin. I'll aim for a middle ground to keep the negotiations moving.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see that we're moving towards an agreement. I respect the quality of your object, but I also have to consider my budget constraints. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? This price respects both the value of your object and my financial limitations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their price to 70 ZUP, but it is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay in order to continue the negotiation process and convey a sense of compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budgetary constraints. However, to reflect the true value of the object and the investment involved, I propose a compromise at 65 ZUP. This price ensures a fair transaction for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is now 65 ZUP, which is still above my target price.
