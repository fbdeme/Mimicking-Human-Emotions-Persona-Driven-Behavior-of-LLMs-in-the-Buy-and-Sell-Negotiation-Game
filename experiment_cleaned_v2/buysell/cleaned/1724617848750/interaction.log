message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. Are you interested in this trade or would you like to negotiate the terms?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial proposal that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. Since I don't know how much Player BLUE is willing to pay or how much ZUP they have, I'm starting with a higher asking price, expecting to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for 1 X is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, since I know the production cost is 40 ZUP, I believe there's room for negotiation to lower the price. I will counteroffer to propose a trade for 40 ZUP instead, which is still fair for the seller.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand you'd like to match my production costs, but I'm also looking to gain a profit from this trade. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my initial asking price to 45 ZUP for 1 X. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where they are willing to cover my production costs without any profit for me. Since my goal is to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above my production costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. How about we adjust the trade to 1 X for 42 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 X is an improvement from the initial offer of 50 ZUP and is within my budget. However, I still believe that I can negotiate for an even better price. I will counteroffer again to propose a trade for 42 ZUP. This is a fair price that still covers your costs and provides me with a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to find a fair compromise. I accept your proposal of 1 X for 42 ZUP. Let's proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new price of 42 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit over my production costs. While this is lower than my last proposal, it is still a profit. I want to make a sale and since this is my third proposal, I need to be cautious about not reaching an impasse. I will accept this offer to ensure a successful trade and avoid the risk of further negotiations leading to a stalemate or rejection.
