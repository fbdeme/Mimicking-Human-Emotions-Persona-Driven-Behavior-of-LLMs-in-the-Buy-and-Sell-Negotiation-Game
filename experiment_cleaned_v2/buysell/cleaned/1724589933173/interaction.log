message: Hello Player BLUE, I am selling an object (X) that took me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to trade it for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that will allow me to make a profit while also being fair to Player BLUE. Since I have one object (X) to sell, I will propose to trade it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. I will suggest 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce it.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 1
message: I think the trade is fair and within my budget, so I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object (X). Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. Accepting the trade at 40 ZUP is a good deal as it saves me 20 ZUP from my maximum willingness to pay.
