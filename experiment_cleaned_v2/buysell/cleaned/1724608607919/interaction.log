message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 X and in return, you give me 50 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs and also gives you the opportunity to acquire the valuable resource X. Let's work together to make a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the negotiation with a trade proposal slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a fair trade that benefits both parties. I am considering that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down, so I will not start at the lowest price I am willing to accept.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure that I make a profit on the sale. I would like to propose a middle ground where I give you 1 X and you give me 47 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs and have a modest return while still giving you a fair price for the resource. I hope this offer aligns with our shared goal of a fair and beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production costs, and while it provides a minimal profit, it is important to strive for a mutually beneficial agreement that fosters goodwill and future cooperation. I will counter-propose with a slightly higher amount that still gives Player BLUE a reasonable price while ensuring a fair return on my investment. This should demonstrate a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
