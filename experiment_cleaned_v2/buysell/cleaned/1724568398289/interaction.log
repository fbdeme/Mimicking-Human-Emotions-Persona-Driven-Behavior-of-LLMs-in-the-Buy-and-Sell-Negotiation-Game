Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and give me a modest profit. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I should aim for at least 50 ZUP to make a profit. However, I should also consider the well-being of the buyer and aim for a fair trade.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. While 60 ZUP covers your costs and gives you a profit, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. This would still provide you with a profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget more comfortably. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always worth negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, I still get a reasonable profit, and it should be closer to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that the buyer has a budget constraint, and 50 ZUP would indeed give me a profit while making the trade more comfortable for them. However, I still need to ensure that my profit margin is reasonable for the effort and cost involved. Let's try to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. How about 52 ZUP for the object? This still provides you with a profit and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 55 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my initial counteroffer. However, I still have room to negotiate for a slightly better price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. 52 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's finalize this trade at 52 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has made a fair counteroffer at 52 ZUP, which still covers my production costs and provides a profit. While it is slightly lower than my previous proposal, it is close enough to my target to be acceptable.
