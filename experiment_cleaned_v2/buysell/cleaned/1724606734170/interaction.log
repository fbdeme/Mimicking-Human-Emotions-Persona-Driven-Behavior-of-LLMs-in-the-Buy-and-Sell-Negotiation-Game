Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for this resource, ensuring I cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, but I am open to hearing your perspective and working together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

Thank you, Player BLUE, for your willingness to cover my production costs. I would like to make a small profit to justify the sale of my resource. I propose a trade where I give you the resource for 43 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit margin, allowing us to conclude our business amicably. I hope this revised offer aligns with our goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Thank you, Player BLUE, for your proposal. I am glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to any future endeavors we may embark on together.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come closer to my last proposal, offering 42 ZUP, which allows for a modest profit. This is just 1 ZUP short of my previous proposal. Considering the cooperative nature of these negotiations and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
