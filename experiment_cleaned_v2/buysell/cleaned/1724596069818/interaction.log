message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object instead. I believe that could work well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that the initial proposal is 50 ZUP for the object X. Since I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP, I can afford this trade, but I want to propose a better deal for both sides to ensure we maximize value. I will propose to buy it for 40 ZUP instead, as I believe that would still be a fair offer.
