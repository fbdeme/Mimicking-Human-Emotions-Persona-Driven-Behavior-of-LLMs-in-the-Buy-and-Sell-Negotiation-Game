message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade where I give you this resource for 50 ZUP, aiming for a fair deal that compensates the production cost and allows for a small profit. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, my initial proposition is going to be slightly above the production cost to start the negotiation on a positive note, leaving room for collaboration and mutual benefit.
