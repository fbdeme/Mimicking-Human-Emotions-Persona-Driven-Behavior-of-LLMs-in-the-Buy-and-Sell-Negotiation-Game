message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive my resource in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I wish to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP should provide a fair margin above the production cost and allow space to adjust based on the buyer's counter-offers.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 40 ZUP for the resource. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I still aim to negotiate the price lower, as I believe the value of the resource might allow for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to secure a good deal. However, I need to make a profit on this sale to sustain my business. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose 45 ZUP for the resource. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource and allows for a reasonable profit on my end. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to purchase the resource at the cost price, which does not provide me with any profit. As a calculating negotiator, I aim to make a profit from this transaction. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure profit. I'll propose 45 ZUP which splits the difference and is a common negotiation strategy.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the resource instead. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my willingness to pay, and it seems like a reasonable compromise. However, I still feel that I can negotiate for an even lower price. I will counter with an offer of 42 ZUP, as I believe it is a fair price without undervaluing the resource.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. To respect the quality and value of the resource, and to ensure a fair trade for both of us, I suggest a slight increase to 44 ZUP. This price reflects the balance between cost and value, providing a fair profit for the production and quality. I hope this offer aligns with your valuation as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my cost price, but it still provides a small profit margin. As a calculating negotiator, my aim is to maximize profit, but I must also consider the risk of the deal falling through. Since we are nearing agreement, I will propose a slightly higher price than what Player BLUE offered, but still lower than my previous offer. I will propose 44 ZUP, which gives me a bit more profit while still showing willingness to negotiate and close the deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 44 ZUP is acceptable and within my budget. However, I still believe I can negotiate further down to maximize my savings. I will propose 43 ZUP, aiming to reach a final agreement while still respecting the value of the resource.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Your offer of 43 ZUP is acceptable, and I agree that it is a fair compromise for both parties. I am pleased we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is only slightly below my last proposal and would still provide me with a profit, albeit smaller than desired. Given that this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and the aim is to maximize benefit while spending the least ZUP, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It guarantees a sale and a profit, which aligns with my goals and the need to complete the transaction successfully.
