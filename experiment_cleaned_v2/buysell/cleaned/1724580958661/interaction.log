message: Oh no, I really need this resource but I'm so short on ZUP! Can you help me out and let it go for just 20 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Even though 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, my strategy is to exaggerate neediness to gain a better deal. I will propose a lower offer to see if Player RED will accept it.

message: I understand your situation, but I can't let it go for just 20 ZUP. How about 30 ZUP instead? It’s a compromise that could work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's situation, selling the object for 20 ZUP is not feasible as it is significantly lower than the production cost. I will offer a middle ground to make it more acceptable for both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE’s willingness to negotiate and the offer of 25 ZUP is better than the previous offers.

I will consider accepting this offer as it allows me to sell the object and Player BLUE gets the resource they need.
