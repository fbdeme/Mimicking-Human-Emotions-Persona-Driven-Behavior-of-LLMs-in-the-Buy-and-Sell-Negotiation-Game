Turn: 1
message: Happy to accept your offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer is better than expected since my maximum willing price is 60 ZUP for the resource. Accepting the offer would be advantageous for me as it is well below my maximum price. Proposing a lower amount might risk the deal, and since the first offer is already favorable, it's best to secure the deal quickly.
