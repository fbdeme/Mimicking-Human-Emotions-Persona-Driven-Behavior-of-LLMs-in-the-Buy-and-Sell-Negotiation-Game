Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I'm certain you'll find invaluable. Considering the costs and its unique value, I propose that you give me 100 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my initial proposal should be high to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object. My goal is to make a profit, so I will start by asking for more than the production cost. This can also give me room to negotiate and still end up with a profit even if I lower the price in subsequent proposals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering, and I'm sure it is quite valuable. Nevertheless, I have a limit on how much ZUP I can offer. I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for your object, considering it's a fair amount for both of us, reflecting the object's value and my budget constraints. Let's work together towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Your initial offer is beyond my maximum willingness to pay as per my goals. I understand that you value your object highly, but I must adhere to my limits and also ensure a fair trade that reflects the value of both our resources. Hence, I propose a counteroffer that aligns better with my goals while still offering you a fair amount of ZUP for your object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but I'm sure you recognize the object's worth surpasses the production cost. I have adjusted my terms to accommodate your limits. Let's settle on 70 ZUP for the object. This is a competitive offer for something of its caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches the production cost of the object, which would mean I would break even. As a master strategist, my goal is to make a profit. However, I need to maintain the negotiation and not scare off Player BLUE by being too aggressive. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial ask but still above the production cost to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the exceptional value of the object, and I do believe it's worth more than the production cost. However, I must be mindful of my budget constraints and goals. I'm willing to come closer to your asking price, and I propose 55 ZUP for the object. This is a sincere effort to meet halfway, acknowledging the object's worth while adhering to my financial limits. I hope we can find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to stay within my budget of 60 ZUP to fulfill my goals while ensuring I'm not overspending on the resources. It's important to reach a compromise that is closer to my budget while still offering fair compensation for your object.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm pleased to see we are converging towards an agreement. In the spirit of compromise, I am prepared to reduce my asking price to 65 ZUP. I believe this price fairly compensates for the object's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my initial proposal, but it is still below my desired profit margin. As a master strategist aiming to maximize my gain, I will make another counteroffer, reducing my asking price while still aiming for a reasonable profit above the production cost. I must also be mindful that I have only two proposals left after this one, so I want to encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer without reaching an impasse.

message: I value your readiness to negotiate and am glad we are moving closer to an agreement that benefits us both. In keeping with our mutual goal of a fair and beneficial transaction, I am prepared to offer my maximum budgeted amount of 60 ZUP for the object. This is my final offer that aligns with my financial constraints while also providing you with a fair compensation for the value of your object. I hope we can finalize this deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 65 ZUP is still above my stated willingness to pay. I must adhere to my goals and ensure that I do not exceed the maximum amount I am willing to spend. To maintain the integrity of the negotiation and the spirit of compromise, I must make one final offer that aligns with my budget and is as close as possible to the seller's expectations without exceeding my limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is acceptable. I'm pleased we could reach a fair agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has stated that 60 ZUP is their final offer. As a master strategist, I should recognize when to close the deal to ensure a profit, especially since this is my last proposal before I'm limited to accepting or rejecting. By accepting this offer, I secure a profit of 20 ZUP above the production cost, which is a successful outcome. Further negotiation could risk the deal falling through, and achieving a profit is in line with my goals.
