message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you this valuable object X for 50 ZUP. It's in excellent condition and could be a great addition to your assets. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by offering the object for a price slightly above my production costs to see if Player BLUE values it higher than its production cost and to leave room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I want to negotiate the price down to maximize my resources. I'll propose to buy the object for 40 ZUP instead.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to counter with 45 ZUP to cover my costs and make a fair profit. I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a price equal to my production cost. While I would like to make some profit, I understand the need for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to find a middle ground and still make a profit.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, but I would like to offer 40 ZUP for the object instead. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my budget, and since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I can consider this trade. However, I would still prefer to negotiate it down further to 40 ZUP if possible. I will propose again to buy the object for 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your continued interest, Player BLUE. I want to make this work for both of us, so how about we meet in the middle? My new offer is 42 ZUP for the object. This allows me to make a slight profit while staying close to your proposed price. Let's close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is sticking to the offer of 40 ZUP, which only covers my production costs. Since I want to make a profit and this is my third proposal, I should try to maintain a position that allows for some profit while also moving closer to Player BLUE's offer to facilitate an agreement.

message: Thank you for your flexible negotiations, Player RED. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 42 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and is within my budget. I initially wanted to pay 40 ZUP, but meeting halfway at 42 ZUP is acceptable. I will accept this proposal as it allows me to acquire the object while spending a fair amount.
