Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP for X. This gives me a profit margin of 10 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm willing to pay 30 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, to ensure I get the best deal possible, I will start with a lower counteroffer. This will leave room for negotiation and potentially save more ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs. I can offer X for 40 ZUP, which covers my costs but doesn't include any profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, leading to a loss. I will counter with a trade proposal that ensures I at least break even.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs. How about 35 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my initial offer. To further test the seller's flexibility and potentially save more ZUP, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my previous offer but still lower than the seller's counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about meeting closer to the middle at 45 ZUP for X? This way, I can cover my production costs and we both move forward with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP still leads to a loss of 5 ZUP, which is not acceptable. I will propose a compromise closer to my break-even point but slightly reducing the price to incentivize a deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay and shows the seller's willingness to negotiate. However, to secure the best possible deal, I will make one more counteroffer slightly lower than 45 ZUP to potentially save more ZUP.
proposal count: 3

reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers my production costs, which is essential. While it doesn't provide a profit, it avoids a loss, making it an acceptable deal.
