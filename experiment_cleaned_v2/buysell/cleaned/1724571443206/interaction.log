message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Given the cost of production, I aim to cover my expenses and earn a profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I buy 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I will propose a counter-offer that benefits me while still being reasonable.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we settle for 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is close to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I am aiming to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 1 unit of X for 55 ZUP is an improvement over my previous proposal of 50 ZUP. Since it is below my maximum willingness to pay and still a favorable deal, I will accept this trade.
