reason: Player BLUE seems to be mistakenly under the impression that they are offering 60 ZUP, which was actually my initial proposal.

I will counter with a slightly lower offer to keep the negotiation moving and to test their willingness to pay a premium, while still aiming to secure a profit above my cost.
