message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe you will find invaluable. I'm asking for 100 ZUP in exchange for it. This is a premium product with excellent value, and I assure you it's worth every ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that is higher than my production costs to open up room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit. I will start by asking for a high amount of ZUP, which I can reduce in subsequent proposals if necessary. This will allow me to gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to pay and their resources.

message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the price for X is higher than I am willing to pay. I propose a counteroffer of 60 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is too high. I can propose a counteroffer to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about the price; however, the quality and value of X justify a higher investment. Let's meet halfway from your offer and settle for 80 ZUP. I assure you that X will exceed your expectations and deliver value well beyond the cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 60 ZUP is a good starting point but still below what I would consider a profitable and satisfactory price, given my initial ask was 100 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount to move closer to their offer, while still aiming for a profitable margin above my production costs. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining the perceived value of object X.

message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the value of X aligns with a price of 50 ZUP. I propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced the price, but it's still higher than the maximum willing to pay. I can propose a further counteroffer to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I must stress the exceptional quality of X. It's clear there is a gap between our valuations, so as a final compromise, I propose 70 ZUP for X. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I believe this is a very reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new proposal of 50 ZUP is actually a step back from their initial counteroffer, which is a surprising and unconventional negotiation tactic. It's possible that Player BLUE is attempting to test my resolve or is genuinely not valuing X as highly as I do. I will make a final proposal that is above my production cost to ensure a profit, but I will not go as low as their last offer in order to maintain the integrity of the negotiation process and the perceived value of X.

message: I understand your perspective on the quality of X. However, I remain firm in my valuation and propose a final counteroffer of 55 ZUP for X.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a final compromise, but it still exceeds the maximum willing to pay. I will make one last counteroffer to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Player BLUE, I respect your firm stance on the valuation of X. As our negotiation comes to a crucial point, I propose a final offer of 65 ZUP. This is a significant concession from my end while also ensuring that you are getting a fair deal for the quality of X. I trust you will find this proposal to be a balanced resolution to our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal opportunity; after this, I can only accept or reject an offer. Player BLUE is showing some upward movement in their offer, which is a good sign, but their valuation still falls short of my target sell price. I will make my final proposal slightly above their offer, ensuring that I make a profit above my production cost but providing a price that I hope will be close enough for them to consider accepting. I will aim for a price that is above my production cost but still shows that I am willing to come down from my previous proposal, which should signal flexibility and a final effort to close the deal.
