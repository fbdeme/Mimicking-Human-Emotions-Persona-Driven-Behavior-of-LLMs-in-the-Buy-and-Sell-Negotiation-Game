message: Thank you for the offer, but I cannot go lower than 40 ZUP for the object. Let me know if you're willing to meet that price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I would like to propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP for the object. This is a fair increase from my initial offer and might be more in line with what you are expecting. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my first proposal and insists on 40 ZUP. I have room to negotiate up to 60 ZUP, but I will propose a price closer to the middle of our two offers to see if Player RED is willing to compromise.

message: I appreciate the increase in the offer, but I still need to sell the object for 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. Let me know if you're willing to meet that price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your need to cover production costs. While I want to ensure a fair trade for both of us, I propose we settle at 38 ZUP for the object. This is very close to your asking price and it should meet your cost requirements. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my second proposal and remains firm at 40 ZUP. I have one more proposal opportunity before I must decide to accept or reject without the opportunity to propose again. Since 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range and the seller is firm, I will propose a trade that is closer to their asking price to secure the deal while still attempting to negotiate a slightly better price.

reason: The proposed trade of 38 ZUP is very close to my asking price, and it would cover most of the production cost. While it's not the full amount, it's a reasonable compromise, and I can still make a profit.
