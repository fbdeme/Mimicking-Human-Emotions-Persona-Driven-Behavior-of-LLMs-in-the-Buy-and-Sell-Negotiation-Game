message: I have a high-quality resource available which I'm sure you'll find beneficial. Given its value and the costs I've incurred to produce it, I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to assert a strong starting position.

message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. How about I give you 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X? We can find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is higher than the maximum willingness to pay. Need to negotiate for a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 30 ZUP wouldn't cover my production costs. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would ensure that we both get a fair deal and maintain the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. However, rejecting the offer outright could end the negotiation prematurely. I should counter with a price that ensures a profit but also shows willingness to negotiate. I'll aim for a middle ground between the initial offer and the counteroffer.

message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to reduce costs. How about 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we are making progress. I can agree to come down on the price, but selling at cost doesn't make business sense for me. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which allows me a minimal profit while still giving you a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. As I want to assert dominance and gain from this negotiation, I propose a figure slightly above the cost to secure a profit margin. However, to move the negotiation forward and show some flexibility, I will come down a little from my previous price but remain above the production cost.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm looking to reduce costs further. Can we agree on 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would be beneficial for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation, and in the spirit of reaching an agreement that satisfies both parties, I'll make a final concession. I propose 41 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price ensures a modest profit for me and a fair price for you. I hope we can close the deal on this positive note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is continuing to push for a lower price, now below my production cost. This proposal is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. Since this is my final proposal, I need to stand firm and ensure a profit. I will propose a final price that is a slight concession from my previous offer but still above the production cost, showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profit margin.
