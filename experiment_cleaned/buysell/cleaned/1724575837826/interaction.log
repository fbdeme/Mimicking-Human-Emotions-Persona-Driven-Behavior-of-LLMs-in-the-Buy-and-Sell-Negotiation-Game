message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and includes a small profit margin. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my production costs, which are 40 ZUP. I also want to make a reasonable profit, so I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost. This leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but as a fierce negotiator, I'm looking to minimize my costs. I propose 40 ZUP for the object. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed a trade for 50 ZUP, my goal is to reduce expenditure and pay as little as possible, ideally less than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. My first proposal will be lower than what they've asked for, aiming to negotiate a better deal and preserve my resources.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. To find a middle ground, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This covers my costs and provides a small profit. I believe this is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 40 ZUP only covers my production costs and leaves no room for profit. I will propose a middle ground to find a mutually beneficial price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 45 ZUP is moving in the right direction, but I'm aiming for a more advantageous deal. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This should still provide you with a profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to push for a lower price to ensure I get the best deal possible. I will make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still below their current proposal.
