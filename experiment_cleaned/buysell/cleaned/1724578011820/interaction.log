message: I am offering my resource X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to make sure that I at least cover my costs. Additionally, I want to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost and then negotiate from there.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe that 80 ZUP is above the market value for this object. I'm willing to offer 55 ZUP for your object X. Let's find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 80 ZUP for the object X, which is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. As a fierce negotiator, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to get the price closer to my target of 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 65 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a good approach, but 65 ZUP is just slightly above what I was hoping to spend. I can come up a bit from my initial offer to 58 ZUP. This is a competitive price and reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP, which is closer to my target price but still above it. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, yet still below my maximum willingness to pay, in an attempt to move the negotiation towards a favorable outcome while maintaining a firm stance.

message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 62 ZUP? It’s a fair compromise and reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE’s offer of 58 ZUP is still above my cost and brings me a profit of 18 ZUP. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will propose 62 ZUP as a final compromise to get a better deal while keeping the negotiation friendly.
