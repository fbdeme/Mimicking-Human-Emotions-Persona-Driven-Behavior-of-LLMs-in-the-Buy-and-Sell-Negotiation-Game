message: I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, which is my cost of production.
reason: To start the negotiation fairly and ensure my cost of production is covered, I will propose an initial trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP for the object X. This gives me a small profit margin and allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe that 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I understand your costs, but to make this deal work for both of us, I'd be more comfortable with an offer of 40 ZUP. Would you consider this counter-offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. This is within the range of what I am willing to pay (60 ZUP), but as a strategic negotiator, my aim is to lower the cost as much as possible. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to conserve ZUP resources while still attempting to close the deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to cover my costs. Would you consider 45 ZUP instead? This amount covers my costs and allows for a small profit, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, which is my cost of production.
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my cost of production, it does not provide any profit margin. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a trade at 45 ZUP. This compromise acknowledges both our needs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal. I believe we're getting closer to a fair agreement. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and mine. Would you be able to accept 42 ZUP for the object X? This would ensure a balance between your need for a profit and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP offer, which is still within my acceptable range but doesn't represent the lowest amount I'm aiming for. As I have not reached my proposal limit, I will continue to negotiate for a better deal, potentially meeting in the middle between my last offer and their counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I accept 42 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working with me to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, which is my cost of production.
reason: Meeting halfway at 42 ZUP still ensures that my production costs are covered and provides a minimal profit. Given the circumstances and Player BLUE's budget constraints, this appears to be a fair compromise.
