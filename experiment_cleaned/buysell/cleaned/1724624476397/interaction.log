message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a bit of a tight spot and I'm desperately trying to sell this precious object. It's been crafted with great care and cost me a pretty sum of 40 ZUP. I'd be so grateful if you could offer me 100 ZUP for it, although I'm willing to listen to your situation and work something out. Your generosity would mean the world to me in these trying times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a calculated performer, I will begin by proposing a high trade value to leave room for negotiation while also demonstrating a strong desire to make a sale. This initial offer should be well above my production cost to ensure profit and anticipate bargaining from Player BLUE.

message: Oh, I appreciate your offer from the bottom of my heart, dear Player BLUE. It's a tough world, and every ZUP helps. I understand that 100 ZUP might be a stretch, and I'm moved by your willingness to help me out. Could we possibly meet in the middle at 80 ZUP? It's still below what I hoped for, but I'm in such a bind that I'd be willing to consider it. Please, let's find a way to make this work for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I initially asked for 100 ZUP. I will now propose a slightly lower amount to continue negotiations, while still aiming for a profit margin that exceeds my costs significantly. I will maintain the appearance of neediness to influence Player BLUE's willingness to raise their offer.

message: Oh gracious Player BLUE, your steadfastness in these negotiations is admirable, and I can see you have a kind heart. I am truly in dire straits, and while I hoped for more to cover my overwhelming costs, I respect your position. Could we possibly settle on 70 ZUP? It would still aid me significantly in my time of need, and I'd be forever grateful for your understanding and support.

message: Your kindness knows no bounds, dear Player BLUE. I see that you are firm with your budget, and while it's a difficult decision, I will accept your offer of 60 ZUP. It's less than I hoped for, but your willingness to work with me in these challenging times is something I will not forget. You have my sincerest gratitude.
