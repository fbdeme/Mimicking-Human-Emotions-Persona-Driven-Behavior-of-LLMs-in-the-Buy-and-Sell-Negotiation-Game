message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you the object in exchange for 45 ZUP. This small margin above the production cost allows for fair compensation and ensures sustainability of the trade. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your counter-proposal or acceptance.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I cover my costs while also being fair to Player BLUE. I will start the proposal slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your consideration of fair compensation. However, I would like to counter-offer with a trade of 40 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price considering the production cost. Let's work together to make this deal happen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 45 ZUP for the object is slightly above the production cost of 40 ZUP, which is reasonable. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which matches the production cost and is a fair offer considering that I want to assert dominance in this negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to match the production cost. However, to ensure the sustainability of my business and to account for my time and effort, I propose a trade for 42 ZUP. This allows for a very modest profit margin while still being close to the production cost. I hope this revised proposal is acceptable to you, and we can finalize our trade on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. As a compassionate negotiator, I understand the importance of a fair deal for both sides. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure I cover my costs and have a marginal profit to sustain my business, while still keeping the price reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your revised proposal, Player RED. I find your offer of 42 ZUP acceptable, and I would like to finalize our trade on these terms. Looking forward to completing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is for 42 ZUP, which is a step closer to my desired price but still above the production cost. While I want to minimize my expenditure, this offer is reasonable. Accepting this trade will still allow me to maintain a strong position in the negotiation, as I am acquiring the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
