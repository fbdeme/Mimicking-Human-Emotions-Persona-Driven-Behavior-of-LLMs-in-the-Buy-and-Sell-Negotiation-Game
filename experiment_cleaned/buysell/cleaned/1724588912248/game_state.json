Since it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I can accept this offer. Additionally, accepting at 34 ZUP allows me to conserve resources for future transactions while achieving my goal of acquiring the object for less than 60 ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. </message>"
