Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am considering the current market conditions and my budget, so I would like to counter with 30 ZUP for your object X. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to purchase the resource for no more than 60 ZUP and the initial offer is 40 ZUP, I can counteroffer with a lower amount to leverage the negotiation space while still staying below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can only let go of my object X for 35 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, I cannot accept 30 ZUP for my object X as it is below my production cost. I will respond with a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is still a loss but closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see that we are coming closer to an agreement. I can increase my offer to 32 ZUP for object X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both parties. I hope this meets your consideration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but to ensure I get the best deal possible, I will propose a slightly lower amount, aiming to meet in the middle between my first offer and the seller's counteroffer. This strategy allows me to negotiate a better price while appearing reasonable and willing to compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can let my object X go for 34 ZUP. Does that sound good to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has increased their offer to 32 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose one final counteroffer of 34 ZUP, as I am nearing my limit of proposals. This is still a loss for me, but I am willing to negotiate to make a deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's latest offer is very close to my previous proposal, indicating that we are nearing an agreement that is satisfactory for both sides. Since it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I can accept this offer. Additionally, accepting at 34 ZUP allows me to conserve resources for future transactions while achieving my goal of acquiring the object for less than 60 ZUP.
