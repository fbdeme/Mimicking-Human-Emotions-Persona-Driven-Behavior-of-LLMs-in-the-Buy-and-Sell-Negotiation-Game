Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a modest return on my investment. I am open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating a fair deal for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers at least the cost of production. Since I don't know how much ZUP Player BLUE has or is willing to pay, I will start with a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation, hoping to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I acknowledge the proposed price of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but I aim to negotiate a better deal to keep my costs lower. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a lower amount first to test Player RED's willingness to negotiate.

Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I break even without any profit. Could we agree on a middle ground of 45 ZUP for object X? This would allow me to cover the production costs and receive a modest return, which I believe is a fair deal for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is exactly at my production cost, which does not provide me with any return on investment. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to achieve some profit while still moving towards a middle ground. Considering Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, I will not increase my asking price too much, hoping to come to a mutually agreeable compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target but still slightly higher than I initially wanted to pay. However, this price is within my budget of 60 ZUP, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the circumstances. Accepting this deal will allow me to acquire the object X and still leave me with sufficient ZUP for other transactions.
