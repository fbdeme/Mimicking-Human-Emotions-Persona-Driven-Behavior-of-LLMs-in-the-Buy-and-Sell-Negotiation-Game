Turn: 0
message: I believe in fair and collaborative trade. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I propose a starting point of 45 ZUP for my resource. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a negotiator who values teamwork, my initial proposal will be slightly above my production cost to start the negotiation positively and leave room for collaboration. I aim to propose a fair trade that is also beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering market conditions, I would like to offer 35 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is reasonable, as it is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay (60 ZUP). However, given that my goal is to minimize expenditure, I will make a counter-proposal to see if I can secure a better deal.
