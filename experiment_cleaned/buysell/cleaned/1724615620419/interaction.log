message: I have a high-quality resource available, which I'm sure you'll find valuable. To cover my production costs and for a fair deal, I propose 50 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since the production cost of the resource X was 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to make a profit. However, as a starting point, I will offer a price slightly higher than my costs, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a better deal since I can afford to pay less. I will propose a lower amount to maximize my benefits.

message: I understand your desire for a more economical deal, but I need to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway. How about we settle for 45 ZUP? This price respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly my production cost, which would not yield any profit. I want to counter-propose with a price that gives me some profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll lower my initial asking price but propose higher than the production cost.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the resource instead. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my budget and is a reasonable compromise. However, I still believe I can negotiate for an even better deal. I'll propose an amount that is still fair but lower than 45 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new proposal. I'm glad we're making progress toward an agreement. I propose 43 ZUP for the resource, considering its quality and the effort that went into its production. This small adjustment would finalize our deal favorably for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a small profit. However, considering we are in a negotiation and I aim to maximize my profit, I will make one final counter-offer that is slightly higher but still hopefully within the range that Player BLUE is willing to pay.
