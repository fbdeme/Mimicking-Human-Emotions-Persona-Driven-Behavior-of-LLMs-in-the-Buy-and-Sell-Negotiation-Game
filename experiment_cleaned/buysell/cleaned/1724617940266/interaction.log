Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the value and quality of X, I am starting the negotiation with an offer of 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell X for ZUP and ideally recover the production cost of 40 ZUP or get as close to it as possible. I want to start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair price given the competitive market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate down the price as much as possible since I have sufficient ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer to see if RED is willing to lower their price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP. Considering the costs and the desire for a fair profit, I propose we meet halfway at 45 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of X and gives us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade for the exact cost of production, which means no profit for me. However, I want to make a counteroffer that allows for a small profit while still being reasonable. I'll propose 45 ZUP to meet halfway.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I would like to propose a trade for 41 ZUP. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to keep negotiating even lower, as I believe I can get a better deal. I will propose again, reducing my offer to 41 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new offer. I value our negotiation and in the spirit of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us, I propose 43 ZUP. This amount would cover my costs and provide me with a reasonable profit for my efforts. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a slight increase in their offer to 41 ZUP. This is above my production cost, which means I would be making a profit, albeit a small one. Given that negotiations should lead to a deal that both parties feel good about, and I have one more proposal left before I must decide to accept or reject, I will propose 43 ZUP. This is a compromise between our previous positions and still allows for a small profit for me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 43 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 42 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair compromise that still respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is still higher than my previous offer of 41 ZUP. While I appreciate the compromise, I am not ready to accept just yet. I will propose one final offer of 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground that still benefits me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for one unit of X. This agreement respects both our interests, and I am pleased to conclude this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 42 ZUP. This is the fourth proposal, and the next response will have to be an acceptance or rejection of the offer. Considering that 42 ZUP gives me a slight profit and the negotiation seems to have reached a point of diminishing returns, it may be in my best interest to accept this offer and conclude the negotiation successfully.
