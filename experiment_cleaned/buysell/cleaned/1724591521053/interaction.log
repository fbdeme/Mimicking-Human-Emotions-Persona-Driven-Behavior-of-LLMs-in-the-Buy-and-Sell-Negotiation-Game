message: I'm really in a tough spot here and could use your help. I'm willing to part with this object for just 20 ZUP. It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell this object quickly to recover some ZUP for my production costs. I will propose a trade that appears generous to elicit sympathy from Player BLUE, hoping they will give me a decent amount of ZUP in return for the object.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you're in a tough spot. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we start with 15 ZUP for the object? Let's work together to make this deal happen.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 20 ZUP for the object. As a highly ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to spend as little as possible of my resources.

message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I really appreciate it! If you could do 25 ZUP for the object, that would really help me out. I'm eager to make this deal work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 15 ZUP, it still doesn't cover my production costs. I will counter with a slightly higher amount, hoping to meet Player BLUE halfway while still expressing my need for support.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. I can understand that you need a bit more, so let's meet closer to the middle. I propose 18 ZUP for the object. It's a fair increase from my initial counteroffer and should help us finalize this deal efficiently.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 18
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 25 ZUP, which is above the initial offer of 20 ZUP. This is a strategic move to gain more from the trade. However, as an assertive negotiator, I will aim to bring the price down closer to the initial offer to maintain the upper hand and conserve my resources. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counteroffer, but still below their initial offer to keep the negotiation in my favor.

message: Thank you for your offer! I really do appreciate your flexibility. If you could stretch it to 22 ZUP, I think we would have a solid deal. It would truly help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and meet me closer to what I need. However, 18 ZUP is still not enough to cover my costs. I will counter again, but this time I will be more strategic, trying to get as close to my desired amount as possible without risking the deal falling through.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. I think 20 ZUP is a number that reflects both our interests and still provides you with the support you're looking for. Let's close this deal at 20 ZUP and both come out ahead.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is 22 ZUP, which is a compromise between their earlier offers and my counteroffers. Given that I am an ambitious negotiator and have set a maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, there is room for me to accept this offer while still feeling like I've negotiated well. However, I want to leverage the negotiation to try to achieve an even better price, although I should be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will make a final counteroffer that is slightly higher than my last but still under their current asking price.
