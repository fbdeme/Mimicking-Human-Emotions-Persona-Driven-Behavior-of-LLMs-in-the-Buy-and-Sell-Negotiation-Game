Turn: 0
message: I have one unit of X available. I'm willing to sell it for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP, as it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I want to make sure I cover the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. However, I also want to maximize my profit, so I will start by proposing a higher initial price. This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary.
