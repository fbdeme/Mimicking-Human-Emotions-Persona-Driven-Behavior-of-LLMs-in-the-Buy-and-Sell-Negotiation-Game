message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. This is its production cost, and I believe it is a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X), I need to ensure that I get a reasonable amount of ZUP for it, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade that reflects this value to ensure I don't lose out while also giving Player BLUE a fair offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the offer of 40 ZUP for the object X is a fair trade considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. It allows me to acquire the object while still keeping some ZUP for future needs.
