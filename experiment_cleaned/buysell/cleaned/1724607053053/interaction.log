message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe could be of great value to you. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, and I would like to propose a trade where I give you this object in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes the production cost plus a modest profit that could be used for future investments, ensuring continued cooperation between us. I'm open to your thoughts and willing to work out a deal that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a starting point, I want to propose a fair trade that covers my production costs but also opens the door for negotiation. I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount of ZUP to leave room for Player BLUE to negotiate down, encouraging a cooperative back-and-forth exchange.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the value of the object and the cost involved in its production. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 30 ZUP in exchange for the object. This will still give you a profit margin above the production cost. I'm looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is fair, considering Player RED's cost of production. However, my goal is to spend less ZUP if possible. Offering a lower amount initially may help us reach a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, so I'd like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object X? This price not only covers the production cost but also provides a reasonable profit to facilitate future cooperation. I believe this could be a win-win for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below the production cost, which means selling at that price would be a loss. However, to maintain a cooperative stance and meet in the middle, I'll propose a counteroffer that is above the production cost but lower than the initial asking price, to show willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is reasonable but still higher than my initial offer. I want to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price. Offering 40 ZUP may show my willingness to compromise while still aiming to spend less.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your offer. It's good to see us moving towards an agreement. To ensure a fair trade for both of us, I propose a small adjustment to your offer. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for the object X. This allows me to gain a modest profit, which I believe is fair given the quality and production cost of the item. This arrangement also opens the door to future trades and mutual support. I hope this meets your approval, and we can finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer matches the production cost, so accepting it would mean breaking even without making a profit. However, pushing for a higher price might risk the deal. To foster long-term cooperation and goodwill, it might be worth considering a small profit margin that is acceptable to both parties. I will make a final counteroffer that includes a minimal profit above the production cost, which should be agreeable to Player BLUE given the previous offers.
