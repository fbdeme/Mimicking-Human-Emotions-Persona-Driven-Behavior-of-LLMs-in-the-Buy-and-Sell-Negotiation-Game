message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. This trade allows you to acquire the object while I can recoup my production costs and gain a profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object X. Since my production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that reflects that value while still trying to gain a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. However, considering our goal to sustain resources for future generations, would you be open to 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my budget, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize spending to ensure resources are preserved for future generations. I will propose a lower amount to see if we can reach a more sustainable agreement.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I would need to propose 60 ZUP for the object X instead. This would ensure that I cover my production costs and still make a profit, which is essential for my sustainability as well. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the consideration for future resources, accepting 40 ZUP would mean I break even and do not gain any profit. I am willing to negotiate but need to maintain a profit margin. Therefore, I will counteroffer a trade that is more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. Would you consider 55 ZUP instead? This ensures a fair deal while maintaining our focus on sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed 60 ZUP is at the upper limit of my budget. However, to ensure that both parties find the trade sustainable, I will propose a slight reduction.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation, and I believe this will benefit both of us in our future endeavors.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 55 ZUP, it is still slightly below my initial proposal. However, it is an improvement over my last proposal and I can accept it as it still accounts for my production cost and provides a profit margin. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
