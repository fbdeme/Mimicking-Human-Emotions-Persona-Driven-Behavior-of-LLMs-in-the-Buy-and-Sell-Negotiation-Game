message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. Given the quality and rarity of the object, this is a fair starting point.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for maximum ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and rarity of the object, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: 40 ZUP barely covers the production cost. To make this worth my while, I need at least 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for maximum ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial counteroffer is exactly the production cost, which means no profit. To achieve a profitable outcome, I need to push for a higher amount.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the production costs, but I can only raise my offer to 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will increase my offer slightly to show goodwill and hopefully reach a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your effort to raise the offer, but 50 ZUP is still too low. I can meet you halfway at 70 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for maximum ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 50 ZUP is still too low to achieve a reasonable profit margin. I will make a counteroffer that still aims for a higher return, but is more flexible.
