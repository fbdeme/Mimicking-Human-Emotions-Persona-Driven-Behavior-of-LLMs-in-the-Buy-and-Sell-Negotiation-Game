message: Let's make a profitable deal. I'm offering a high-quality resource that's well worth your investment. How does 80 ZUP sound for this exceptional item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to start the negotiation with an aggressive offer that will give me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit margin above my production costs. I'll offer the resource for a high amount of ZUP, expecting the counteroffer to bring the price down to something that's still profitable.

message: Thank you for the offer, but 80 ZUP is a bit high for me. How about 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 80 ZUP is too high for my goals as I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. I will start with a lower counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate downwards.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but let's find a middle ground. How about 70 ZUP for the resource? It's a premium product that justifies the cost, and I'm sure it will serve your needs excellently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which would mean no profit for me. I want to push for a higher price to ensure a profit. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production costs, aiming to meet somewhere favorable.

message: 70 ZUP is still a bit high for me. How about 50 ZUP for the resource? I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a counteroffer closer to my maximum limit to see if Player RED is willing to compromise further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is moving in the right direction, but I still need to see a bit more value on my end. Let's go for 65 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and value of the resource and ensures a fair deal for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP only gives a 10 ZUP profit, which is minimal. As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than the previous one but still provides me with a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 65 ZUP is very close, but I can only go up to 60 ZUP. This is my final offer. I hope we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 65 ZUP is still slightly above my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a final counteroffer at my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. If they do not accept, I will have to consider rejecting.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your final offer of 60 ZUP is acceptable. Let's close the deal at that price. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer of 60 ZUP provides a profit of 20 ZUP, which is a 50% increase over the production cost. While it's not as high as I initially aimed for, it's a decent profit margin and pushing further might risk the deal altogether, especially since I've reached my proposal limit. Accepting this offer concludes the negotiation successfully while still ensuring a profit.
