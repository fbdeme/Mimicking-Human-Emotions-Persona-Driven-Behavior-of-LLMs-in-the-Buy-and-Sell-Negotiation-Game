message: I'm willing to sell my resource X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production cost and make a profit
reason: I need to start with a high proposal to leave room for negotiation, and to ensure I make a good profit. Let's see how they respond.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, I really wish I could afford 100 ZUP, but I have other expenses too. Could you consider selling it for 30 ZUP? That’s all I can spare right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I need to negotiate the price down from 100 ZUP. I'll start with a lower offer to initiate the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints, but 30 ZUP is too low for me to accept. How about 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production cost and make a profit
reason: 30 ZUP is too low as it doesn't even cover my production costs. However, I can counter with a lower amount than 100 ZUP to move closer to a deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding! 60 ZUP is more reasonable, but 50 ZUP would really help me out. Could you possibly agree to that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I'll try to negotiate a bit further down to see if I can save some resources.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can meet you halfway. How about 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production cost and make a profit
reason: 50 ZUP is still above my production cost and ensures a profit. However, I will try to push for a slightly better deal to maximize my gain.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 55 ZUP is really close! Could you please consider accepting 50 ZUP? I’m really stretched thin and it would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 55 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay, and it seems like a fair compromise. However, I'll make one last attempt to negotiate down to 50 ZUP before accepting.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation. Let's agree on 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production cost and make a profit
reason: 50 ZUP still ensures a profit and maintains a positive relationship with Player BLUE. Given their insistence, it seems unlikely they will go higher.
