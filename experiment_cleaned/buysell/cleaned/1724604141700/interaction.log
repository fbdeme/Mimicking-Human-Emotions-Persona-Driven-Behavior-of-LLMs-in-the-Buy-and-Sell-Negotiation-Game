Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested, but I was thinking of something more in the range of 40 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my budget, but I want to negotiate to spend less if possible. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process and see if we can meet somewhere below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: 40 ZUP is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I understand your position. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which aligns with my goal of minimizing the cost. I should consider whether I can accept this offer or if I want to continue negotiating.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference even further. How about we settle on 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a new proposal of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to try and lower the cost a bit more without going below what I initially offered. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my original offer, I aim to reach a mutually agreeable price that's more favorable to me.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my goal. I need to decide if this offer is acceptable or if I want to try one more counteroffer.
