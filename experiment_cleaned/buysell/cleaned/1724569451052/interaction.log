message: Hello BLUE, I have an object for sale. Given its high value and the cost of production, I propose a trade of 60 ZUP for 1 X. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: I want to start high to see the willingness of Player BLUE to negotiate. My goal is to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP, as that's the cost of production. However, I will initially propose a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. Given the market conditions and other available options, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair offer for 1 X. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal matches exactly my willingness to pay, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal to save some ZUP. Let's start by proposing a lower amount and see if RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. Given the production cost and the value of the object, I believe 50 ZUP would be a fairer price. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: While 40 ZUP is my break-even point, I want to see if I can get a little more out of the deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than 40 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 X? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED is willing to drop the price to 50 ZUP. This is a reasonable reduction, but I will try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Given the value and cost of production, would you be willing to meet at 48 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is close to my break-even point and shows good faith in negotiation. I will propose a slightly higher amount one more time, to see if I can maximize the ZUP I receive.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. How about we finalize the deal at 46 ZUP for 1 X? I believe this would be fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is close to the 45 ZUP I proposed. This is a reasonable offer, but I will make one more attempt to lower the price slightly.
