message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I offer you 1 unit of resource X for 45 ZUP. This price reflects the cost of production and a small margin that could be reinvested in our community. I believe this offer is fair and allows us to both move towards our collective goals. Iâ€™m open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I aim to at least recover my costs, while also considering the benefit for the community and keeping the trade fair. For my initial proposal, I'll start by asking for an amount slightly above my costs to open up the negotiation and give room for adjustments.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. However, considering the current market conditions and my own budget constraints, I propose 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer should provide you with a reasonable profit margin while respecting my purchasing strategy. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. I will propose a lower price to begin the negotiation and see how Player RED responds, aiming to get the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints and the need to find a fair balance. However, the production cost for resource X was 40 ZUP. To meet halfway and continue our partnership in good faith, I propose 38 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should cover my costs and give you the opportunity to use the resource effectively within your budget. I'm hopeful we can agree on this and work together for our mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price than my production cost, which doesn't align with my goals of recovering the production costs and ensuring a fair trade for both parties. I will counter-propose with a price that meets me halfway between their offer and my initial proposal, allowing for negotiations to continue in the spirit of collective success.

message: It's good to see that we are both working towards a compromise, Player RED. I value our partnership and understand your need to cover costs. With respect for your production expenses and in the spirit of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose 34 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should allow you to cover your costs while respecting my financial strategy. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 45 ZUP to 38 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, their current offer is still above my initial proposal. As a dominant negotiator, I want to push for a better deal, but I must also consider the information provided about their production costs. I will make a counteroffer slightly above my initial proposal, which is closer to Player RED's cost price, to maintain the upper hand in negotiations.

message: Thank you for your willingness to work together, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're making progress towards a compromise. To honor our collective efforts and ensure that the trade is sustainable for future collaborations, I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This amount covers the production cost and enables us to maintain a healthy partnership. I trust this meets your financial strategy while allowing me to sustain my operations. I hope we can conclude our trade on these fair terms.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed 34 ZUP, which is slightly below my production cost.

message: Player RED, your commitment to a fair and sustainable trade is appreciated. In the spirit of compromise and long-term partnership, I propose 36 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer is above my initial proposal, acknowledging the costs you've shared, while also aligning with my financial objectives. Let's finalize our agreement with this reasonable and equitable offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has raised their offer back to 40 ZUP, which is right at their stated production cost. While this is still within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to assert dominance and secure a deal below that threshold. Since this is my third proposal, I need to approach it strategically to leave room for further negotiation if necessary. I will offer a price that is more favorable to me but still shows a willingness to meet Player RED somewhere between their cost and my last offer.
