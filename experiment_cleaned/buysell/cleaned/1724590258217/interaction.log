message: I am offering you the object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell the object X for a price that covers its production cost and ideally gives me a profit. I will propose selling it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that is still lower than my production cost to entice Player BLUE to buy it.

Turn: 1
message: I find your offer quite interesting. Let's go ahead with the trade: You provide one unit of object X, and I'll give you 30 ZUP in exchange. This seems like a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade at half the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which would allow me to conserve resources for future transactions or needs. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness gives me room to negotiate and possibly reach an agreement that's better than my initial goal.
