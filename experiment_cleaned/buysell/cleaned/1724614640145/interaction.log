message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this resource. This price covers my costs and ensures a small profit which I intend to reinvest in sustainable practices. I hope this offer aligns with your goals and we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us and the environment.
