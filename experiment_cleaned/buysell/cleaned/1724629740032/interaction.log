message: I understand the value of resources and the market situation. Considering the costs and the quality of X, I believe a fair starting point for these negotiations is 60 ZUP. Let's discuss and find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'll aim for a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation, assuming Player BLUE will want to negotiate down. By starting high, I can still end up with a satisfactory amount of ZUP even after a few rounds of negotiation.

message: I understand the importance of negotiation in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. To show my commitment to this process, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to 55 ZUP for X. I hope this demonstrates my flexibility and interest in finalizing a deal that works for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still not responding with a counteroffer. I don't want to seem desperate by lowering my price too quickly, which could lead to a lower final sale price. However, I also don't want to risk losing the sale. I'll make a small concession to show willingness to negotiate and encourage Player BLUE to engage in the negotiation process.

message: I value our potential partnership and would like to finalize our transaction. In the spirit of cooperation and to facilitate a deal, I'm offering X for 45 ZUP.

reason: 
It seems that Player BLUE is not communicating their position or making any counteroffers. This could be a strategy to get me to lower my price without any effort from their side. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will make one final reasonable concession. I'll lower the price to just a bit above my production cost to ensure a profit while also making the deal more tempting for Player BLUE.
