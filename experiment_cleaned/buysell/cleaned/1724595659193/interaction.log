my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their price to 30 ZUP, which is a good reduction from the original 35 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can push it just a bit lower to save more of my resources.
