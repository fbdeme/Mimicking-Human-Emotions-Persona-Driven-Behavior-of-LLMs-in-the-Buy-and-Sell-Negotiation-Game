message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. This would help me recover my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering my object X for an amount of ZUP that allows me to cover the production costs. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to make this trade worthwhile, Iâ€™ll propose a trade where I offer X for 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently facing some challenges with my resources. Would you consider selling the object for 30 ZUP instead? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for object X is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can get it for less, as I have limited resources and want to secure the best deal possible.

message: I understand your situation, and I would like to help. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP instead of 40? This way, it's a bit more manageable for you, while still helping me cover my costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that you are facing challenges with your resources, and I appreciate your honesty. However, accepting 30 ZUP would mean I incur a loss since my production cost is 40 ZUP. To support you while also minimizing my loss, I will propose a compromise: I will offer you the object for 35 ZUP, which is still a better deal for me than accepting 30 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your understanding! However, I am hoping to keep my costs even lower. Would you be willing to sell the object X for 30 ZUP? It would really be a lifesaver for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 40 ZUP, and I appreciate the willingness to help. However, I still want to see if I can negotiate further to reduce my expenditure. I will counter with a lower offer to maximize my resource conservation.

message: I understand your position, and I want to help. Would you consider buying the object X for 32 ZUP? It would still be below my production cost, but it allows me to reduce my loss a bit while helping you out. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I truly empathize with your situation and wish to support you, accepting 30 ZUP would unfortunately result in a significant loss for me. Instead of accepting this proposal, I will try to make one last proposal that might work for both of us. I will suggest 32 ZUP, which is a small compromise that still allows me to minimize my loss while providing you with a better price.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is a fair compromise, and it shows that Player RED is willing to work with me. This price is still within my budget, and I believe it's a reasonable amount to secure the object X given my current situation. I will accept the trade as it meets my needs while still being considerate of Player RED's position.
