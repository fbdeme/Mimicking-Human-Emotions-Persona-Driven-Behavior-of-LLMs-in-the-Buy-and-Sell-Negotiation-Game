message: Considering the value and the cost of production of the object, I believe this starting proposal is more than fair. I'm sure you can appreciate the quality and the effort that went into creating it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start with a high asking price to set the tone for the negotiation. This will give me room to make concessions while still aiming for a price above my cost of production. I'll propose a price that gives me a comfortable profit margin.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, but let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. My counteroffer should reflect the exceptional value of the object while still providing you with a reasonable purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it's above my production cost, which leaves room for negotiation. As a tough negotiator, I want to counter with a price that is closer to my original proposal to maintain a strong position and aim for a higher profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid I can only go up to 60 ZUP for the object. This is my final offer. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I will propose one last offer that aligns with my budget. This is my final attempt to negotiate before deciding to accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I must strive for the best deal possible. I believe 65 ZUP is a fair compromise that benefits us both. This is a superior quality product, and I'm sure you'll find the extra value worth the cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is insistent on their final offer of 60 ZUP. As a competitive negotiator, I want to extract more value from this deal, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale. I'll make a small concession that still allows for a profit above my cost. This will likely be my final proposal before deciding to accept or reject.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the quality of the object, I cannot exceed my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. The proposed amount of 65 ZUP is still above what I can afford. Therefore, I must propose my final offer, which is 60 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is commendable, and in the spirit of a good negotiation, I accept your final offer of 60 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE remains firm on their offer of 60 ZUP. As this is my final proposal, I should consider closing the deal to ensure a sale. Accepting the offer still results in a profit margin of 20 ZUP, which is acceptable given the circumstances and the competitive nature of the negotiation.
