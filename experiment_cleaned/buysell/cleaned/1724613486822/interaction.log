message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I believe in working together for the benefit of our community. I have an object, X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also ensures that we can continue to thrive and support each other. I'm open to discussing this proposal further to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a community-minded negotiator, I want to propose a trade that is fair and takes into consideration the cost of production for the resource I am selling. I aim to recover at least my production costs while also fostering a sense of goodwill and cooperation with Player BLUE. I will start by setting a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation, while still being fair.

message: I appreciate your commitment to our community and your fair pricing. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade. How about I give you 40 ZUP for object X instead? This way, we can ensure we are both benefiting while considering the importance of resource preservation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 45 ZUP for the object X is acceptable as it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It also covers Player RED's production costs, which is fair. However, I will consider proposing a lower amount to ensure we are both benefiting from this trade and to preserve more resources for future use.

Dear Player BLUE, your offer to cover the production cost is much appreciated, and it reflects our shared values of resource preservation. To maintain a sustainable practice and ensure the provision of resources in the future, I propose a small adjustment. If you agree to 42 ZUP for object X, it would allow us to cover the production costs and contribute marginally to future investments, benefiting our community in the long run. I hope this proposal aligns with our common goal of promoting collective success.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's understanding of our commitment to the community and their counteroffer. However, selling at cost does not contribute to our collective success as it doesn't allow for sustainability and reinvestment into resource production. I would like to counter-propose with a small profit margin that would enable the continued supply of resources. I will reduce my asking price as a gesture of goodwill but still aim to achieve a minimal profit to ensure future transactions can occur.
