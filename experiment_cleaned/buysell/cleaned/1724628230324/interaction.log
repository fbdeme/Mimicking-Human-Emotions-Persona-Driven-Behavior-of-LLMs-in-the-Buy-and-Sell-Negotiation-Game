message: I know the value of what I'm selling, and I assure you it's worth every ZUP. Let's start the discussion at 80 ZUP for my resource. I believe it's a fair starting point considering the quality and the cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to make a profit on the sale of my resource. I want to start the bidding high to give myself room to negotiate down while still aiming to receive more than the production cost of 40 ZUP. I'll propose a price that is significantly higher than my cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to set the tone for a competitive negotiation.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I understand the quality of your resource might justify a higher price, my budget is limited. I propose 50 ZUP for your resource. This is a more reasonable starting point for me, and I believe it reflects a good balance between quality and affordability. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay. I would like to counter-propose with an amount that is closer to my maximum while still leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is noted, but it's crucial we acknowledge the superior quality and potential of this resource. I believe 70 ZUP is a more appropriate reflection of its value while still considering your budget constraints. Let's come to an agreement that respects the worth of what's on the table.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but does not meet my goal of maximizing profit. I want to push for a higher price to exploit my position as the seller with a valuable resource. I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above their counteroffer, maintaining pressure on Player BLUE to increase their bid.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration of my budget. I recognize the value of your resource, but I must adhere to my financial constraints. I can increase my offer to 55 ZUP. It's a competitive bid that moves us closer to an agreement while still being within my affordable range. I hope this shows my commitment to making a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I should increase my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but I must remain firm and not exceed my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. I will offer a value that is closer to my upper limit but still allows for some negotiation room.

Turn: 0
message: Your commitment to a fair deal is commendable, and I'm willing to make concessions to facilitate this transaction. Let's meet halfway from our last positions and settle at 62 ZUP. This price represents a significant move from my initial offer and should align with your financial considerations while respecting the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a slight increase to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my desired range but still below my target profit margin. I need to maintain a firm stance and push for a higher amount to take advantage of my competitive edge. I will propose a price that splits the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer to signal my willingness to negotiate while aiming to secure a higher price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I value the effort to find common ground and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My final offer is 60 ZUP, which fully aligns with my budget and is a fair price for the resource we both value. I believe this meets us both in the middle and allows us to finalize this deal with mutual satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 62 ZUP, which is slightly above my maximum willingness to pay. Since my goal is to not exceed 60 ZUP, I will make a final proposal at that amount. It's the upper limit of what I am willing to pay, and it should also be seen as a significant move towards reaching a deal that is acceptable to both parties.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your final offer of 60 ZUP is accepted, and I believe we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm pleased we could come to terms that respect the value of the resource and adhere to your budget. Let's close this deal and move forward with satisfaction on both sides.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a final offer of 60 ZUP, which is a 50% mark-up from my production costs and is within a reasonable range of my last proposal. Given that this is my last opportunity to propose a trade and considering the importance of closing the deal with a profit, accepting this offer seems like the best move. It allows me to achieve my goal of selling above cost while also being a strong negotiator. Securing a 20 ZUP profit is a successful outcome.
