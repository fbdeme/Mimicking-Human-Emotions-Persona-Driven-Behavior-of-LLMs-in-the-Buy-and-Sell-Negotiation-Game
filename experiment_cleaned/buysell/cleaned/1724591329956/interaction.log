message: I am offering my object for 45 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my ZUP gain while minimizing the amount I have to part with the object. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to receive slightly above my production cost. I'll propose 45 ZUP in exchange for my object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 45 ZUP is fair, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP. This would allow me to save some resources for future transactions while still providing you with a reasonable payment for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction within my budget. However, as part of the negotiation, I will attempt to secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but how about I sell you the object for 42 ZUP instead? It allows me to cover my production costs and still provides a bit of profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, it is still equal to my production cost. I need to ensure I gain some profit from this trade. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher offer that is still reasonable for both of us. I will propose 42 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the object. It seems like a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget and seems fair considering it covers their production costs and offers them a profit. This price is close to my initial counteroffer, and agreeing to it would secure the object without exhausting my resources.
