You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Although Player RED has come down to 63 ZUP, which is slightly above my stated maximum, I must stand firm on my budget limitations. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, I need to consider the possibility of a small concession that could lead to a successful deal without significantly compromising my goals. I'll offer an alternative that is within my limits but also shows willingness to value the resource. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad we are moving towards an agreement. I really do see the worth in what you're offering, but I must stick to my budget of 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us, considering the constraints I'm working with. Shall we finalize the deal at this price? </message>"
