Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering production costs and supporting sustainability, but I am also committed to preserving resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your commitment to sustainability and the need to cover production costs. I propose a compromise at 37 ZUP. This offer is a bit higher to ensure your costs are covered, while also being mindful of resource conservation. Hopefully, this meets both our needs.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has reiterated their position on the cost of production and sustainability. Since the offer of 40 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, I should consider the broader impact of the negotiation. It is important to support sustainable practices, but I will make one more attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal that aligns with my goals and principles before considering acceptance.
