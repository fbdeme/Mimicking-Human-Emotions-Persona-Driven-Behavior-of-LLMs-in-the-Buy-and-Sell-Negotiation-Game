Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I've been looking everywhere for this, and it would mean a lot to me. Times are tough, and every ZUP saved helps. Could you consider 30 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, I'll try to negotiate a better deal by appealing to the seller's emotions, making them feel sympathetic towards me. By doing so, I aim to reduce the cost even further without revealing my actual resource limits.
