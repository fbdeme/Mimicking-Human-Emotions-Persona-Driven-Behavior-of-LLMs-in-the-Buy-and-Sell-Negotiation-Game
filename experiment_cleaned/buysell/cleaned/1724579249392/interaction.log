Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This will ensure I cover my production cost and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to initiate the trade and set the baseline for negotiations. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I will start with a proposal that gives me a profit margin, but not too high to scare off Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I'm aware of the costs involved and would like to propose 55 ZUP for the unit of X. This should still cover your costs while allowing us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial proposal from Player RED aligns with my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a fair deal. Nonetheless, it's often expected to negotiate to see if we can reach a better deal, especially since this is the starting offer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation but not too low to offend or derail the negotiation process.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 58 ZUP for the unit of X? This way, we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable, but I would like to maximize my profit. I will propose a slight increase to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 58 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-counteroffer of 58 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. Given that this is still within my acceptable range and that further negotiation might result in marginal gains at the risk of complicating the deal, it might be reasonable to accept this offer. This would ensure a successful transaction without exhausting further negotiation capital and resources.
