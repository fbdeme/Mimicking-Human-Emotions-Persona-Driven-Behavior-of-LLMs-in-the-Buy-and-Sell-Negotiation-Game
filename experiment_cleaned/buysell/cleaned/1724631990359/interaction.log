message: Given the unique quality and high demand for this item, I'm sure you understand its value. Let's start the negotiation at 60 ZUP for my object X. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a higher trade value to leave room for negotiation. I aim to make a profit but I will start with an inflated price to give the impression that there's room for bargaining.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the value of the object, but I would like to propose 50 ZUP for object X. This is a fair offer considering the current market and leaves us both with room for any future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum that I am willing to pay for the resource. It would be a good strategy to try and negotiate a better deal to conserve some of my resources if possible, so I will propose a lower amount. However, I should be careful not to offend Player RED with a lowball offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need for future cooperation. However, considering the production costs and the premium quality of the object, I propose a compromise at 55 ZUP. This price reflects a fair deal that benefits us both and maintains a good relationship for future dealings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my initial cost, but still allows for a profit. However, I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my gain. I will propose a price above the cost but lower than my initial offer to appear reasonable and willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand and respect the quality and costs associated with your product. I propose 52 ZUP for object X as a fair middle ground, leaving us both with additional resources for future investments and collaborations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but it's still beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible. I should propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still lower than what RED has proposed to reach a more favorable middle ground.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 52 ZUP is very close to what I consider a fair deal. To finalize our agreement and ensure a profitable venture for both sides, I propose we settle at 53 ZUP. I believe this is a beneficial arrangement that allows for a slight increase while still respecting your willingness to find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 52 ZUP is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon while still attempting to maximize my returns. I will counter with a small increase, which should seem reasonable and likely to be accepted, while still improving my profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration and the willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 53 ZUP for object X. I'm looking forward to future opportunities to work together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 53 ZUP is just below my maximum willingness to pay, and it is a reasonable compromise. It's close to the initial 50 ZUP I proposed and well within the budget I have for this purchase. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably, allowing me to secure the resource while preserving a good relationship for future transactions.
