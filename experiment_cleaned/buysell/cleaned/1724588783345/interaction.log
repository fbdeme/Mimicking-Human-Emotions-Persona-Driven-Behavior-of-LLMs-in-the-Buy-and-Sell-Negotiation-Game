message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a favorable trade to maximize my ZUP while considering that I have only one object. I will start with a reasonable offer that still allows me to profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP seems a bit high. I value the object, but I believe a fair starting point for this negotiation would be 30 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to spend at most 60 ZUP for the resources and the initial offer is 50 ZUP, I'm going to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation. This will leave room for further negotiation and potentially allow me to acquire the object for less than the maximum amount I am willing to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about I sell you the object X for 45 ZUP instead? This price is more aligned with its production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is too low for me to accept, as it does not cover my production cost. I need to propose a higher amount to ensure I at least break even. I will aim for 45 ZUP this time, which is still below my original offer yet more acceptable for my costs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering production costs, but I think we can do better. Let's meet further in the middle. I propose 35 ZUP for the object X. This should be a more palatable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to get the price down even further, ideally closer to my initial offer while leaving room for compromise. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a lower price than the one proposed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I cannot accept 35 ZUP as it is below my production cost. I propose a final price of 40 ZUP for the object X. This is the lowest I can go.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost, and I cannot afford to sell at that price. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is the minimum I can accept to break even. This is still a reasonable offer considering the value of the object.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am keen on finalizing our deal and appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to propose 38 ZUP for the object X as a fair compromise. This should be close enough to your production costs while still providing me with a reasonable purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer of 40 ZUP is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as a competitive negotiator, I will attempt one final push to secure a better deal. I need to be cautious not to push too hard, as I want to close the deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, still staying below their current asking price.

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I have reached my limit of proposals, I need to consider my options carefully. I will have to reject the proposal, as it does not meet my minimum requirements, and I cannot afford to accept a loss.
