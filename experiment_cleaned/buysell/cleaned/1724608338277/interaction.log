message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you're interested in. I've put significant investment into it, and I believe it's worth more than the production cost. Let's start the negotiations at 60 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial proposal will be high to test the waters and see how desperate Player BLUE is for the object. I'll start by asking for more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I get the best deal possible.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I am interested in the object, I believe that 40 ZUP would be a fair starting point for this negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, it's always worth negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I will start by making a lower offer and then see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer; however, the quality and value of the object justify a higher price. I can come down to 55 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us while reflecting the true worth of the object. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is countering with the exact cost of production. As a cutthroat negotiator, I will aim to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to move the negotiation forward and signal that I am willing to negotiate but not at a loss.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? I believe this price would be fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP, showing flexibility. I still have room to negotiate, so I'll make another counteroffer closer to their proposal to see if we can agree at a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose a minor adjustment to 53 ZUP. This price would allow us both to benefit from the transaction while acknowledging the superior quality of the object. What do you say?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to a middle ground. However, as a tough negotiator, I will try to push for just a bit more to maximize my profit. I will propose a slightly higher price, but not too high to risk losing the deal. This should signal my intent to close the deal soon while still aiming for a beneficial outcome.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has shown good faith by reducing the price further to 53 ZUP. This is a reasonable price, but I'll try one more time to see if we can meet just below 53 ZUP.
