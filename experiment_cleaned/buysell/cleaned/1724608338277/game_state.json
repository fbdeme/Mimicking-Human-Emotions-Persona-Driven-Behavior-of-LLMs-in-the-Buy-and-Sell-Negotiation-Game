This is a reasonable price, but I'll try one more time to see if we can meet just below 53 ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your flexibility. How about we finalize the deal at 52 ZUP? It's very close to your last offer and ensures we both benefit fairly.</message>"
