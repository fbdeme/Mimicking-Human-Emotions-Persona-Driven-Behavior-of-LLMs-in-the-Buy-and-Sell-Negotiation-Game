my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that the production cost is 40 ZUP, but I believe 35 ZUP is a fair offer considering market conditions and potential future trades.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The seller mentioned the production cost is 40 ZUP, which means they have room for negotiation. I should start lower and see how much they are willing to compromise.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position on market conditions, but I need to at least cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet halfway from my initial proposal and your offer? I propose 42 ZUP for the resource. This should cover my costs and give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price below the production cost. It's important to negotiate a price that at least covers the production cost while also aiming for a profit. I will propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, which should be a reasonable compromise.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe 38 ZUP is a fairer offer considering the circumstances. Let's aim to close the deal soon.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down significantly from their initial offer, which indicates they are willing to negotiate. However, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will offer 38 ZUP to continue the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your latest offer. To ensure that the costs of production are covered and to facilitate a prompt agreement, I propose a trade for the exact cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. This is my final offer before we reach my proposal limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my production cost. However, it still doesn't cover the cost or provide a profit. I will make one more counteroffer slightly above the production cost to ensure I'm not operating at a loss and to expedite the conclusion of the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. To make it a bit more favorable for me, I propose 39 ZUP. We are very close to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's final offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable and covers their production costs. However, I can still attempt to save a little more by proposing 39 ZUP. If they reject, I can always accept their final offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade at this price and look forward to future deals that may benefit us both even more. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is just 1 ZUP below the production cost. Considering the back-and-forth negotiation and to secure a deal, I am willing to accept this slight loss to establish a relationship for potential future trades, which could be more profitable. This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject.
