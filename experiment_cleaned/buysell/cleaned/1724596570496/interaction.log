Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your need to stick to your price. Perhaps we can meet halfway? Would you be willing to sell the object for 35 ZUP? It would really make a difference for me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand Player RED's position and their need to maintain the price, but I still feel that 30 ZUP might be a fair compromise. However, given that they are firm on the 40 ZUP, I will now propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP to see if they are willing to negotiate down slightly.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and appreciate your firm stance. I will accept your initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is very firm on their price of 40 ZUP and has not budged from it despite my offers. I feel a sense of urgency to acquire the object, but I also want to make sure I don't overspend. Since I have already proposed twice, my options are limited. Therefore, I will accept the original offer of 40 ZUP, as it is still within my willingness to pay.
