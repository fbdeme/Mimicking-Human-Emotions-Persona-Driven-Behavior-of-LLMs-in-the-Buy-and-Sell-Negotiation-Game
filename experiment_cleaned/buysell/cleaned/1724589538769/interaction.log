Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell you the object (X) for 40 ZUP. This is the amount it cost me to produce it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object (X) for ZUP to recover my costs, but I also want to ensure that the trade is fair for both parties. I am proposing a trade where I give the object (X) for a reasonable amount of ZUP that helps cover my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the costs involved in producing the object. However, I'm dedicated to preserving resources for the future. Could we consider a price of 35 ZUP for the object? This would help in minimizing resource expenditure while ensuring a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to conserve resources and will attempt to negotiate a lower price to ensure sustainability.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about resource expenditure, and I appreciate your offer. To reach a middle ground, I propose selling you the object (X) for 37 ZUP. This is still below my production cost but allows me to recover some of my expenses while being considerate of your goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to minimize expenditure, I also need to recover my production costs. Accepting 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. However, I value our negotiation and am willing to meet you halfway to find a fair solution. I will propose a trade at 37 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but closer to an acceptable range for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. This agreement reflects our shared commitment to sustainability and fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. It's only slightly higher than my previous offer and still aligns with my goal of conserving resources. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively and quickly while respecting my sustainability values.
