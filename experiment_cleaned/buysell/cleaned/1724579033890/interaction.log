message: I am offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. This covers my production cost and adds a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1

reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit. I will start with a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit, but 80 ZUP is too steep for me. My resources are limited, and I need to make a prudent investment. I can offer 50 ZUP. It's a fair price considering the current market and ensures you still make a profit without overburdening my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. By countering with a lower offer, I aim to negotiate a more favorable trade that aligns with my goals and resources. It is important to start with a lower bid to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a compromise that is closer to my target price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at 65 ZUP? This way, I still make a reasonable profit, and it’s a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP still gives me a profit, it is lower than what I aimed for. I will propose a middle ground to find a mutually beneficial deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, 65 ZUP is still a stretch for my budget. I can come up a bit from my initial offer to 58 ZUP. This would be close to my upper limit, and it should still provide you with a decent profit margin. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, the counter is close to my limit, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. I should make another proposal slightly below my maximum willingness to pay to move closer to an agreement while still striving for the best deal possible. By incrementally increasing my offer, I can show Player RED that I am willing to negotiate while still staying within my budget.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 58 ZUP is a bit lower than my desired profit margin, it is still above my production cost. To close the deal, I will propose a slight increase from your offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. The price of 60 ZUP works for me, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's go ahead and finalize the transaction at this price. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has agreed to a price that matches my maximum willingness to pay. It is a strategic move to accept this offer as it meets my predefined budget constraints, and further negotiation may risk the deal or lead to a less favorable outcome. Securing the resources at my maximum price point is a success and allows me to maintain my budget.
