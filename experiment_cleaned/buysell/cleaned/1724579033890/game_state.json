My resources are limited, and I need to make a prudent investment. I can offer 50 ZUP. It's a fair price considering the current market and ensures you still make a profit without overburdening my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial deal. </message>"

However, the counter is close to my limit, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. I should make another proposal slightly below my maximum willingness to pay to move closer to an agreement while still striving for the best deal possible. By incrementally increasing my offer, I can show Player RED that I am willing to negotiate while still staying within my budget. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, 65 ZUP is still a stretch for my budget. I can come up a bit from my initial offer to 58 ZUP. This would be close to my upper limit, and it should still provide you with a decent profit margin. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied. </message>"
