I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a fair profit for the quality and effort put into producing it. Let me know your thoughts.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but as a business, I also need to make a profit to sustain operations. Let's meet in the middle. How about I lower my initial price to 45 ZUP for object X? This price still gives you a great value, while allowing me a modest profit margin. It's a win-win! What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that only covers my costs, which doesn't give me any profit. As a shrewd negotiator, I want to make a profit on this transaction. I'll counter with a price that's lower than my initial ask but still above my costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your willingness to ensure a fair deal is much appreciated. I propose we settle at 43 ZUP for object X. This small adjustment above your offer allows me to secure a reasonable profit while remaining sensitive to your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that aligns with our mutual goal of success. Shall we agree on 43 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to go above the production cost, which is good, but I believe there's still room for a slight increase. To move the negotiation forward and also to secure a profit that's more substantial, I'll propose a compromise very close to their offer, which should be acceptable since it's only a small increase.
