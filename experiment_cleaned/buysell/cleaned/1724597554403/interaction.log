Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I accept the trade of 1 object for 40 ZUP. I hope this helps you cover your production costs.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the object, I can accept this initial proposal of 40 ZUP for 1 object. This price is well within my budget, and it seems like a fair deal considering Player RED's desperate situation to cover production costs.
