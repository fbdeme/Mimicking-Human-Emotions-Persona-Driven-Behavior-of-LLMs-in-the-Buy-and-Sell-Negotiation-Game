message: Hello Player BLUE! I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that is beneficial for both parties. Since I have one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I'll start by proposing a reasonable amount that allows me to recover my costs while also providing value to Player BLUE.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! I can let the object X go for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, it's a step towards negotiation. I want to keep the dialogue open and see if we can reach a more acceptable agreement. I will propose a counter-offer that is slightly lower than my original request but still closer to my production cost.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. How about 33 ZUP for the object X? That would be a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my budget and is a reasonable compromise. However, I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to see if I can save more ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE! I accept the trade for 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is closer to my production cost, and I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. While it's still below my original cost, accepting this trade would allow me to recover some resources rather than none. I deem this a reasonable compromise.
