message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay 50 ZUP for the object instead. Letâ€™s see if we can make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I am a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if I can get the object for less than 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This ensures I make a bit more profit while still giving you a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer of 55 ZUP. I can go up to 52 ZUP for the object. Let's find a way to make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the counter-offer of 55 ZUP is an improvement from my initial proposal, I still believe I can negotiate further down. I want to stick to my strategy of minimizing my expenditure, as I have the room to maneuver within my budget. I will propose 52 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to lower their price further.
