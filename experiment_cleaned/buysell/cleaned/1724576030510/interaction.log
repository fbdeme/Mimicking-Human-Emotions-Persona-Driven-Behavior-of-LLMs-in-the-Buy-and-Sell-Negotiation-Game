Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate. I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object. This offer is made in good faith, considering the need to maintain a balance between production costs and a fair market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED has set an initial asking price based on their production cost plus a profit margin. However, my goal is to acquire the resource for as low a cost as possible, ideally for less than the maximum I am willing to pay. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price, but still within a reasonable range to keep negotiations open and to signal that I am interested in a fair trade.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your fair offer of 45 ZUP. To ensure a small profit, I propose we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is very close to my production cost. Since my goal is to make a profit, albeit a small one, I will propose a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I believe we're close to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP to finalize our deal. This should cover your production costs and provide a profit, while also respecting my purchasing budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to minimize expenditure. Offering a slightly lower amount might still secure the deal while saving resources. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, proposing a value slightly below 48 ZUP could still be acceptable to Player RED, given the proximity to their last offer.
