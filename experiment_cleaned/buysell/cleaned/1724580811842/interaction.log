message: I appreciate your offer. Considering sustainability and resource preservation, I propose 20 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal of 30 ZUP for the object X is within my budget and aligns with my goal of minimizing spending. However, I believe I can negotiate for a lower price to preserve more ZUP for future trades.

message: Thank you for your proposal! I understand your focus on sustainability. How about I sell you the object for 25 ZUP? I believe this will support both our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's focus on sustainability, 20 ZUP is significantly lower than the cost of production for my object. I want to maintain a balance where both parties feel satisfied with the deal. I will propose a counter-offer that is still lower than my original price but closer to my production costs.
