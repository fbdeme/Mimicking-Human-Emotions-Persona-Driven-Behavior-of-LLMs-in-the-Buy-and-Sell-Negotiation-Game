message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. This is the price at which I produced it, and I believe it reflects its value. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade where I sell the object for a price that covers my production cost. Since I want to minimize my ZUP expenditure, I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP. This is my first proposal, and I aim to make it clear that the value of the object is equal to my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I propose 30 ZUP for X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for X is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to optimize resource expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but considering my production cost, I can offer the object X for 35 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I need to ensure that I do not lose the opportunity to sell the object. I will counter with a trade proposal of 35 ZUP, which is a compromise between my original asking price and the buyer's offer. This way, I can still make a profit while also showing willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and counteroffer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for X? I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try one more negotiation to see if we can reach a slightly better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is a reasonable compromise compared to my previous offers. Accepting this trade would mean a loss for me, but it also allows me to avoid the risk of not selling the object at all. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
