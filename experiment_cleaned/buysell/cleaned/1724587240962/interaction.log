message: I am really hoping to sell this valuable object to you. I have put so much effort and resources into creating it, and I truly believe it's worth the investment of 30 ZUP. This would really help me recoup some of the costs I've been bearing. What do you think?

message: I completely understand your position, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about I let it go for just 20 ZUP? This is really the lowest I can offer, and it would mean so much to me to sell this object. I hope we can finalize the deal!
