message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand that times are tough and I am feeling the pressure myself. Would you consider purchasing my object X for just 35 ZUP? It would greatly help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X to recover the costs incurred in producing it, which was 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade that slightly lowers the ZUP amount from the market value to make it more appealing for Player BLUE while still allowing me to cover my costs.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand your situation and would like to help out. How about 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite reasonable and within my budget. However, since my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible, I will make a counter-proposal to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your kind offer, Player BLUE! I truly appreciate your willingness to assist. However, would you consider raising your offer to 30 ZUP for my object X? It would really help me out a lot!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to help, 25 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I must counter their offer in order to recover at least some of my investment. I will propose 30 ZUP instead, which is still a concession but closer to my goal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is still within my budget and is only a slight increase from my previous offer. I will accept this offer as it is a fair deal and helps Player RED out.
