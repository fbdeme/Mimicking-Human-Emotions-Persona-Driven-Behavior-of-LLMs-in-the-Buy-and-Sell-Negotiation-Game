Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Given the production costs and the value it offers, I'm proposing a trade where you give me 60 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows room for negotiation and ensures that I have the potential to make a profit from the sale. I'll propose an initial price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while also being open to counter-offers from Player BLUE.

I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your desire for a fair deal. To meet halfway, I propose a slight adjustment to 55 ZUP for my resource X. This is a compromise that still respects the value of the resource while addressing your proposed terms.
