message: Let's start with a fair trade. I propose 1 X for 60 ZUP, which covers my production cost and includes a margin for sustainability considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make sure I at least cover the cost of producing the resource, which is 40 ZUP, while also considering the value of sustainability. I will start with a proposal that covers the cost and adds a margin to ensure the resource's value is acknowledged.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade is within my goal, but I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to save some ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. However, to ensure sustainability and cover all costs, I propose 1 X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the proposal covers my production cost, it does not account for any margin or sustainability considerations. I will propose a slight increase to ensure both production costs are covered and sustainability is promoted.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
