message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I offer you one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This starting proposal takes into account the production cost and the value I believe resource X holds. I look forward to your response and am open to discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade that reflects the production cost of my resource, X. I am asking for a slightly higher amount than the production cost to start the negotiation, giving me room to adjust based on Player BLUE's counteroffer. This initial proposal is meant to open the dialogue and set a baseline for the negotiation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your proposal and understand your position. However, I must consider the value of the resource and the need for a marginal profit. Therefore, I'd like to propose a revised trade where I give you one unit of resource X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE proposed a trade that matches the production cost of my resource. While this would recoup my investment, it doesn't account for any potential profit. I want to negotiate a price that gives me a marginal profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE. Therefore, I'm going to counter with a slightly higher amount but still lower than my initial ask.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I am grateful for your willingness to find a middle ground. I propose a modest increase to 44 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This figure gives us both a fair balance between the cost of production and the potential value for you. Let's aim to close this transaction amicably. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above the production cost and offers a small profit. This is closer to a reasonable middle ground between our last proposals. I would prefer a higher amount, but I also recognize the importance of closing the deal without excessive haggling. I will try to propose a slightly higher amount, but if Player BLUE is firm on their offer, I should consider accepting it to ensure a sale.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I propose a final adjustment to 43 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this small difference will still meet both our interests. Please let me know if you can agree to this final proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 44 ZUP is close to my target. However, in an attempt to secure the best deal possible, I will make a final counteroffer.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your final offer, and I accept the proposed trade of one unit of resource X in exchange for 43 ZUP. I believe this is a satisfactory agreement for both parties. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 43 ZUP, which provides a modest profit above the production cost. Given that this is our fourth proposal, it is important to consider finalizing the deal before reaching an impasse. The offer is close enough to the last proposed figure, and it is wise to secure a sale rather than risk losing the opportunity over a small difference in ZUP. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer.
