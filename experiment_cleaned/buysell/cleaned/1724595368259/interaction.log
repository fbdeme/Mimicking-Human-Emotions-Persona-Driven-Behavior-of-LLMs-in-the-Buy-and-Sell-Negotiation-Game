Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP is well within my budget of 60 ZUP, and it helps Player RED cover their production costs. This seems like a fair trade and meets my goal of purchasing the object without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.
