message: I'm offering one unit of X for 50 ZUP. Let's find a fair deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I need to at least break even. However, I will propose a starting price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer! How about 40 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Based on my goals, the initial proposal of 50 ZUP for one unit of X is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, since my strategy is to spend the least ZUP, I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about 45 ZUP for the unit of X? This way, it accounts for both of our interests a bit better.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer meets my minimum requirement to break even. However, it's always worth trying to negotiate a bit more to account for potential profit.

message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but my goal is to spend the least ZUP possible. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to assert my position while keeping the negotiation open.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and allows me to make a small profit above the production cost. It seems fair and beneficial for both parties.
