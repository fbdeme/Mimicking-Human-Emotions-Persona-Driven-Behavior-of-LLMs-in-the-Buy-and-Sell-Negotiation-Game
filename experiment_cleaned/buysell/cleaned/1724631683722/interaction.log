message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X which I'm sure you'll find invaluable. Considering the market trends and the superior quality of my object X, I believe an offer of 80 ZUP is more than fair. I'm looking forward to your counter-proposal if this does not suit your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a shrewd negotiator, I want to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal than my production costs. I'll propose a high price initially to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to set a high anchor point.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of your object X. However, considering my current resources and the personal valuation I've placed on the object, I would like to counter-propose with 50 ZUP. Let's find a fair middle ground that benefits us both. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay. To begin negotiations, I should propose a lower amount that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for compromise.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's indeed aim for a middle ground. I propose a slight adjustment to 70 ZUP for my object X. This price reflects both the quality of the object and a reasonable compromise for us both. I trust you'll find this to be a fair step towards an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. As a shrewd negotiator, I want to push for a higher price without risking the deal. I will propose a price closer to my initial asking price but still providing a "discount" to give the illusion of a concession.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. I see we are moving towards each other, and I value that. I propose 55 ZUP for object X, inching closer to your asking price while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED reduced their asking price, but it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to counter with an amount that is closer to my target price but also shows I am willing to negotiate upwards, incrementally approaching a mutually acceptable price.

message: Player BLUE, it is heartening to see your commitment to a fair deal. I am also committed to finding a mutually beneficial price. Letâ€™s meet a bit further. How about 65 ZUP for object X? This price takes into account your budget and still acknowledges the value of the object. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope you agree.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 55 ZUP, which is still above my production costs but not as high as I would like. I aim to secure a higher price, but since Player BLUE is moving slowly, I'll propose a price that is lower than my previous but still provides me with a satisfactory profit margin.

message: Player RED, I am glad to see us both working towards a deal. I value your object X and your willingness to negotiate. I would like to make a final offer of 60 ZUP, which is the upper limit of my budget for this transaction. I hope you'll consider this a fair price for your valuable object and that we can conclude our negotiation successfully.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, we are approaching a more reasonable range. I should make a final proposal that is at my maximum willingness to pay, showing that I am at my limit and providing a last chance for compromise.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your earnest negotiation and respect your budget constraints. Your offer of 60 ZUP is accepted. I'm pleased we've reached a fair and successful conclusion. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made their final offer of 60 ZUP. This is a 20 ZUP profit over my production costs, which is a good margin. It's also close enough to my last proposal that accepting it would be reasonable, especially considering it's my fourth proposal and I won't be able to counter again without breaking the rules. I should accept this offer to close the deal successfully and secure a profit.
