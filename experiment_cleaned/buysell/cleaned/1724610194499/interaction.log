Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object at hand, and I'm looking for a fair trade. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to at least break even. I will start by proposing a price a bit higher to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the high-quality object you are offering. To ensure we both get a fair deal, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is reasonable and falls within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to try to negotiate a slightly better deal to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair deal. However, considering the quality and the investment made, I propose a slight increase to 45 ZUP to make this trade beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost to produce the resource. As a shrewd negotiator, I'd like to gain a profit. However, I must also consider the possibility of Player BLUE walking away if I push too high. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to find a middle ground and secure a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and the quality of your object. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is fair and still within my maximum willing to pay (60 ZUP). However, I will try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can reduce the cost further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I believe this is a fair compromise and am happy to accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. Offering 42 ZUP is close to my asking price, and while it's only a small profit over my cost, it's better to close the deal with a guaranteed profit than to risk losing the sale in hopes of a larger one.
