my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but 70 ZUP is still too high for me. I am willing to increase my offer to 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum, but still below it to leave room for negotiation.
