message: Dear Player BLUE, I value collaboration and aim for a trade that benefits us both. My resource X cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP, which allows me to recover my costs and provides you with the resource you need. I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to reach an agreement that serves our common interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I believe in collective success and mutual benefit, I would like to start by proposing a fair trade that covers my production costs while also being a reasonable offer for Player BLUE. I will propose a starting price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to offer 30 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair counter-offer and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable, as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to drive the price down as much as possible to maximize my benefit. I will counter with a lower offer and see how they respond.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your budget concerns and your willingness to negotiate. I have considered your offer and would like to propose a trade of 1 X for 37 ZUP. This is a reduction from my initial proposal and closer to my production costs. I hope this revised offer is more aligned with our goal of achieving a mutually beneficial trade. Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which doesn't cover my expenses. I want to work towards a collective success, so I will counter with a price that is closer to my production cost but still offers a concession from my initial proposal. I hope this will show my willingness to negotiate and come to a fair agreement.

message: Thank you for your revised offer. To further align with my budget, I propose 33 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 37 ZUP is a reasonable reduction. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for a lower price to maximize my advantage. I will propose a new trade of 1 X for 33 ZUP. This keeps us negotiating and might get us closer to an optimal deal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're making progress towards an agreement that respects both our positions. I propose a final compromise of 1 X for 38 ZUP. This meets exactly in the middle of our last two offers, and while it's slightly below my production cost, I'm willing to accept this in the spirit of cooperation and collective success. I hope you find this proposal acceptable, and we can close the deal on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to my production costs, which is a good sign of their willingness to reach a compromise. However, the offer still falls below my production costs. As my goal is to at least break even and maintain our collective success, I am willing to make a final offer that meets us both in the middle. This should demonstrate my commitment to a fair trade while still covering my costs.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. As a final attempt to reach a middle ground, I propose 35 ZUP for 1 X. This is very close to your final offer and still respects both our positions. I hope we can finalize our deal with this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 38 ZUP is higher than my last proposal but still well within my budget. Given the minimal difference from my previous offer and considering their willingness to compromise, it may be strategic to accept this deal to secure the resource X. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will make one last attempt to push the price slightly lower before considering acceptance. I will propose 35 ZUP for 1 X.
