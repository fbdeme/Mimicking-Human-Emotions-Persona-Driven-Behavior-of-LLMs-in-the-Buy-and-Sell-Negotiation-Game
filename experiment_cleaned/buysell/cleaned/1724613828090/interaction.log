message: I appreciate your offer for object X. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which aligns with your production cost. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 35 ZUP, which is below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I will counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which meets the producer's cost, ensuring a fair trade for both parties.
