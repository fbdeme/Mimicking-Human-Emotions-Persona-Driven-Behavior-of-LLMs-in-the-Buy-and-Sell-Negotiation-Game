message: Player BLUE, times are tough, and I really need to make ends meet. I'm proposing to sell X for 60 ZUP. Please consider it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a somewhat reasonable proposal to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate. My cost is 40 ZUP, so I should aim to make a profit but be prepared to come down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand the tough times and I want to help. I propose 55 ZUP for X to conserve some resources while also supporting your needs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED is in a difficult situation and needs to make ends meet. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to support them, but also aim to conserve my resources. Since they are asking for the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, keeping in mind that I might have to go up to the 60 ZUP if necessary to help them out.

message: Player BLUE, I really appreciate your understanding. How about 58 ZUP? It would help me cover my costs a bit better. Please, I really need this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate and has made a fair counteroffer. However, to maximize my profit, I should attempt to counter slightly higher.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to meet you at 58 ZUP for X. Let's complete this trade and support each other through these tough times.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I can see that Player RED is in need and the proposed price is close to my maximum willingness to pay. As a compassionate negotiator, I believe it's important to ensure that Player RED can cover their costs. While I still want to conserve my resources, it's equally important to support Player RED in this transaction. Therefore, I will accept the proposed price of 58 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise just below my maximum limit.
