message: I am offering to sell you one object (X) for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is beneficial for me. Since I have one object (X) that I can sell, I will propose to sell it for a price higher than its production cost of 40 ZUP but reasonable enough to entice Player BLUE. I will propose to trade X for 50 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: That's a bit steep for my taste. How about we make it 40 ZUP for one X? This is a competitive offer considering the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered an initial price of 50 ZUP for one unit of X. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal and spend as little ZUP as possible. My goal is to buy the resources for less than or equal to 60 ZUP, but I will start by proposing a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would be willing to sell you the object (X) for 45 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, meaning I wouldn't make any profit. I need to maintain my negotiating position and find a compromise that allows me to sell the object for more than 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer with 45 ZUP, which is still below my initial offer but provides me with a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 42 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a fair increase from my initial offer and should be an attractive deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 45 ZUP. While this is within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to reduce the cost further. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, yet still below the RED's counter to continue negotiations.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is still below my desired selling price of 45 ZUP, but it is above my production cost. While I would be making a profit, it is not the profit I initially aimed for. Given that I have only one object and the negotiation is nearing its limit, I will accept the offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale.
