message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you'll find invaluable. Considering the cost and the demand, I think 100 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to make a profit, I'll start by proposing a trade that is higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. I'll start high to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 100 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). Therefore, I will need to propose a counter-offer that better aligns with my budget while still being reasonable.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can find a middle ground. How does 80 ZUP sound? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price. I will counter with a reduced price that is still above my costs to aim for a profit while appearing to meet in the middle.

Turn: 0
message: I respect your position and understand your budget constraints. As a sign of good faith and in the interest of finalizing our deal, Iâ€™m willing to come down to 70 ZUP. This is a very competitive price for the value you're receiving. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is persistent with their offer of 60 ZUP. While it's above my production cost, I want to push a bit more for a higher profit.

reason: Player BLUE is sticking to their offer of 60 ZUP, and this is my final counteroffer.
