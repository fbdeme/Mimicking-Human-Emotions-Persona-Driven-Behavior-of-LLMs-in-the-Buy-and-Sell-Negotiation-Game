message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand that the object X is of utmost importance to you. Given its unique attributes and the costs involved in its production, I propose a fair trade where you provide 80 ZUP in exchange for X. I believe this deal will be beneficial to both of us. I await your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my goal is to start the negotiation by setting a high price to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit that exceeds my production costs. This initial proposal is meant to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object X.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I believe 80 ZUP is a bit high for the object X. I propose a trade where I provide 40 ZUP in exchange for X. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 80 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate down to a price that aligns with my goal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I must seek a fair return on my investment into the object X. I have reduced my initial proposal significantly. How about we settle for 60 ZUP? This should cover the value of X while considering your budget constraints. I'm open to further discussion and eagerly await your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which doesn't provide any profit. As a master strategist, I aim to maximize my gain without revealing my production cost. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still above my production cost, ensuring a profit margin. This also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and puts pressure on Player BLUE to increase their offer.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. While 60 ZUP is within my budget, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is still a fair offer considering both our interests. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current proposal of 60 ZUP aligns exactly with my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a calculating negotiator, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to maximize my gain.

message: Dear Player BLUE, your offer of 50 ZUP is much appreciated, and I'm glad we are getting closer to an agreement. To meet halfway and finalize our deal promptly, I propose a fair price of 55 ZUP for object X. This modest increase ensures a beneficial transaction for us both. I hope this meets your approval, and we can conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production costs, ensuring a profit. As a master strategist, I want to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gains. By proposing a number just above their offer, I can potentially achieve a higher sale price without pushing too hard and risking the deal. This also leaves room for a final negotiation if necessary, as this is my third proposal out of a maximum of four.

newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
