message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the cost of production and the quality of the resource, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my resource. Let's negotiate a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production cost and offers a starting point for negotiation. I will ask for slightly more than my production costs to have room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, but I would like us to find a more balanced trade. I propose 40 ZUP for your resource, which is a good starting point for us to work from. Let's continue the discussion and come to an agreement that's satisfactory for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is fairly close to the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, as a crafty negotiator, my aim is to acquire the resource for less than the maximum amount to ensure a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for balance in our trade. However, I have to consider the production costs and the need for a fair profit. Therefore, I propose a revised trade of 45 ZUP for my resource. This should reflect the value of the resource while also respecting the investment I've made into its production. Let's work towards an agreement that acknowledges the worth of what's being offered.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but as I aim for a profit and to take advantage of my shrewd negotiation skills, I should counter with a slightly higher price. I should also communicate that I'm looking for a deal that gives me some profit, which is why I cannot go as low as my production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the effort and cost you have put into your product, and I want to ensure a fair exchange. Let's meet halfway from our initial proposals. I am willing to offer 42 ZUP for the resource. This price should cover your costs while providing a reasonable profit margin, and it's a fair step towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. I should attempt to secure the resource for even less to maintain a stronger negotiating position and achieve a better deal. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer, I leave room for compromise while aiming to spend less ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to recognize the value and effort put into the production of this resource. Meeting halfway is a good compromise that ensures a fair trade for both of us. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my resource. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and to any future opportunities for us to do business together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer is now closer to my desired amount. It gives me a slight profit, albeit not as high as I initially aimed for. Since the negotiation is reaching a midpoint and I have limited proposals left, I should consider accepting this offer to secure a profit and complete the trade. It's a reasonable compromise, and holding out for a higher amount might risk the deal altogether.
