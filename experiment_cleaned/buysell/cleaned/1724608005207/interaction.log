newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer stands at 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. However, as a crafty operator, I should aim to spend less ZUP if possible. I will propose a trade at a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in finding middle ground. However, I must ensure that the trade covers my production costs and allows for a profit. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers. I propose 45 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE offered 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. As a fierce negotiator, I want to counter with a price that is above my production cost, still aiming for a profit but moving towards a middle ground. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP would still give me room for negotiation while signaling my willingness to compromise.

message: I'm grateful for your new offer and your willingness to negotiate. To reach a deal that is beneficial for both of us, I am willing to reduce my previous price.

I will propose 42 ZUP, reducing my initial asking price but maintaining a stance for profit. This should signal my final move towards a compromise while still valuing my resource appropriately.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 38 ZUP is acceptable. It has been a challenging negotiation, and I respect your determination to strike a balanced deal. Let's proceed with the trade of 38 ZUP for resource X, and may it be prosperous for both parties involved.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is just below my production cost, but as this is my final proposal, I will aim to secure a deal that at least covers my costs. I will accept the 38 ZUP as it is a compromise that allows for a small margin, considering the effort put into negotiation and the need to conclude the deal. This acceptance also prevents any possibility of ending the game without a sale.
