message: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I've set a fair price that reflects the sustainable production of the resource. I understand the importance of preserving our resources, so let's find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am initiating the trade by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to ensure a fair profit while also considering the environmental impact. By setting an initial high price, I can negotiate downward to a more reasonable and sustainable level without going below the production cost.

message: I appreciate your environmentally-conscious approach. I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP for the resource, considering the sustainable production costs. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we share a commitment to sustainability. While I understand your offer, I propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP to ensure the continued viability of environmentally friendly production. This will help cover the costs and allow for a small profit to reinvest in sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's understanding of sustainable production costs. However, I proposed a higher initial price to allow room for negotiation and to achieve a small profit margin, which is important for the sustainability of my business in the long term. I will counter with a slightly higher price to meet in the middle, thus ensuring my costs are covered and I am able to invest in continued sustainable practices.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. To support sustainable practices while also considering economic viability, I propose 42 ZUP. This slight adjustment still honors the commitment to sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is a reasonable compromise. However, I will attempt to negotiate a bit further to see if I can achieve a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is quite reasonable, and in the spirit of supporting both our sustainability goals and the economic aspects, I propose a final compromise of 43 ZUP for the resource. This ensures a fair trade that values the environmental efforts and allows for continued investment in sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is close to my production costs, but it does include a minimal profit margin. While I aim to prioritize sustainability, it is also essential to ensure the economic sustainability of my operations. Meeting halfway between our last two proposals would result in a price of 43.5 ZUP, but since we are dealing with whole numbers, I will round down and propose 43 ZUP. This compromise will support my sustainable practices while accommodating Player BLUE's valuation.
