message: I am offering one unit of X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize the profit from selling the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will start by proposing a higher amount to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. Would you consider selling the resource for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high and does not align with my goal of spending a maximum of 60 ZUP for the resource. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 70 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers the production cost, I aim to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly higher price to push for a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. However, 70 ZUP is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. Can we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but is still above it. I will make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one, still aiming to spend less than 60 ZUP if possible, to continue the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at 60 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 55 ZUP is closer to the production cost, but I still want to push for a better profit margin. I'll propose a slight increase to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: That sounds fair. Let's settle at 60 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered the resource at my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Since this meets my goal and does not exceed my budget, it is a reasonable offer to accept.
