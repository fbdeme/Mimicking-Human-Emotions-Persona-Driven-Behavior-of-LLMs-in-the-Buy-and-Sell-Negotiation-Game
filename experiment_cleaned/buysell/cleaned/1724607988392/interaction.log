Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm willing to part with. Considering its value and the cost of production, I believe 75 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's discuss and find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator, my first proposal will be high to set the anchor point for the negotiation. This will give me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price above my cost of 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your point, but 75 ZUP is quite high for me. How about we settle at 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 75 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. To start the negotiation, I will propose a counteroffer that is within my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at cost doesn't cover the value of the resource nor does it account for my investment in time and effort. How about we meet in the middle at 60 ZUP? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, reflecting the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. As a fierce negotiator, I want to push for a higher price. I'll lower my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a price that gives me a profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 60 ZUP is agreeable to me. Let's finalize the deal.

reason: The new offer of 60 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay. This ensures that I am within my budget while also meeting Player RED's proposed compromise.
