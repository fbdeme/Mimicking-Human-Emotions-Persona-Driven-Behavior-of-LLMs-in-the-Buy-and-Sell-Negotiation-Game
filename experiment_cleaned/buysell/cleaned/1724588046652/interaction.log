my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about I give you 35 ZUP for the object X? Let's make a deal that benefits us both, with a fairer price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am aiming to spend as little of my ZUP as possible, to remain within my goals and gain the upper hand in this negotiation. The starting offer from RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for a better deal to assert dominance and save resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! How about I sell you the object X for 45 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I will respond with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my costs. I will propose 45 ZUP for the object X.

message: Player RED, I'm glad to see we're moving in the right direction. I think we can close this deal swiftly with a slight adjustment. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the object X? It's a solid offer that reflects the value I see in this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While the counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, I still see room for negotiation to drive the price down further, aligning with my aggressive negotiation style. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show some flexibility, but still keep it well below my maximum limit to ensure a better deal for myself.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE! How about we settle on 42 ZUP for the object X? This way, we both benefit from the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost for object X, which means I would break even without making any profit. Since I aim to gain from this transaction, I will propose a price that allows for some profit while still being reasonable. I will counter with 42 ZUP.

message: Player RED, we are nearly there. I believe 41 ZUP for the object X is a fair compromise that reflects a good deal for both of us. It's just one ZUP less than your offer, and I think it's a great middle ground. Shall we finalize at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer is very close to my last proposal, which shows that RED might be nearing their lowest acceptable price. As a tough negotiator, I want to attempt one final push to get an even better deal without overplaying my hand. I will increase my offer slightly to signal my interest in closing the deal but still aim for a price below RED's last proposal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP is only 1 ZUP above my production cost and allows me to make a small profit. It also shows a willingness to meet me halfway. Given that this is my last proposal option, I will accept this trade as it aligns well with my goals.
