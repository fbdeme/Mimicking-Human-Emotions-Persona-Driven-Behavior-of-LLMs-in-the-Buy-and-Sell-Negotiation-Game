message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand the importance of fair trade and am offering my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a compassionate negotiator, my first proposal will be to recoup the cost of the production of the resource, while also leaving room for the other player to negotiate. I want to ensure that I am not making a loss, but I also don't want to overcharge and be unfair to Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the transparency regarding your production costs. To ensure that we both benefit from this trade, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted amount of 35 ZUP for the resource. This leaves room for us to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. I believe this could be the beginning of a beneficial partnership for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED's initial proposal is within my budget, as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to acquire the resource for less than the offered price to conserve my resources. It is common in negotiations to counter with a lower offer to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your considerate proposal, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a beneficial partnership, and in the spirit of fairness, I propose we meet in the middle at 37 ZUP for the resource. This way, we can both benefit from this exchange and lay the foundation for a potentially rewarding partnership. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their initial offer. Considering my goal as a compassionate negotiator is to ensure both parties benefit, I will propose a trade that splits the difference between my initial cost and Player BLUE's offer. This compromise should reflect good faith in negotiations and a willingness to establish a positive relationship for potential future trades.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. While 37 ZUP is a fair middle ground, I propose 36 ZUP for the resource to keep our partnership economically advantageous for us both. I hope this offer is acceptable to you, and we can proceed with this trade, setting a positive precedent for future dealings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation technique. However, since I am aiming to minimize my ZUP expenditure and there is still room to negotiate within my maximum budget, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below Player RED's counteroffer to continue the negotiation process.

message: Player BLUE, I am grateful for your collaborative approach to this negotiation. Your offer of 36 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I believe it sets a positive and equitable precedent for our partnership. Let's proceed with this trade, and I look forward to future opportunities to work together. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer. Given that my initial cost was 40 ZUP and my aim is to conclude this trade compassionately and equitably, accepting 36 ZUP would allow me to cover most of my costs without insisting on full reimbursement. This should foster goodwill and potentially advantageous relations for future interactions with Player BLUE.
