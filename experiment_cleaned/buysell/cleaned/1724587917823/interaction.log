my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can offer 40 ZUP for 1 object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 1 object X for 50 ZUP is quite high, considering my willingness to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources. I need to negotiate for a better price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, I would like to propose a slight increase. How about I give you 1 object X in exchange for 45 ZUP? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production for the object, I need to consider my goal of maximizing profit. I will propose a counteroffer to see if they are willing to increase their offer slightly.

message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I believe I can offer 40 ZUP for 1 object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced the price to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I can consider this offer, but I may still try to negotiate for a better price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence, Player BLUE. I will accept your offer of 40 ZUP for 1 object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is firm on offering only 40 ZUP, I need to decide if I want to accept this offer or risk losing the sale. Given that 40 ZUP is the exact production cost, it might be wise to accept rather than risk not completing the trade.
