message: I am offering the object for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and gives me a reasonable profit. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a reasonable trade that covers my production costs while leaving room for negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will propose a starting trade at 60 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and ensure I make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for profit. Would you consider a price of 55 ZUP for the object? This could be a starting point for us to negotiate a fair deal that is beneficial for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer from Player RED aligns with my maximum budget. However, as a negotiator focused on collaboration and teamwork, I will attempt to propose a slightly better deal that could be beneficial for both parties. I will offer a bit less than the asking price, which could open up negotiation for a potentially better deal for both sides without depleting my resources completely.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 55 ZUP. To ensure a fair profit margin, I would like to propose 58 ZUP for the object. This still provides a reasonable profit for me while being close to your offer. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is close to my initial proposal and still provides a profit margin above my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin while staying within a reasonable range for negotiation.
