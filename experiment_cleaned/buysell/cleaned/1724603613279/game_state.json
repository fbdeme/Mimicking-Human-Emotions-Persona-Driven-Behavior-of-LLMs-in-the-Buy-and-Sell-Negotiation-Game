I'm definitely interested in making a deal.

Since this is within my goal of 60 ZUP and as a selfless negotiator, I am considering the greater good. Meeting in the middle or close to their asking price without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay could lead to a satisfactory outcome for both parties. By agreeing on a price slightly below their asking price, I can save some resources for future endeavors that benefit the greater good while also respecting Player RED's valuation of the object. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your position on wanting 40 ZUP for the object. To move towards an agreement that reflects both our interests, I propose 38 ZUP for the object. This is a step closer to your asking price and still allows me to maintain resources for future investments in the greater good. Let's continue to find a fair middle ground. </message>"
