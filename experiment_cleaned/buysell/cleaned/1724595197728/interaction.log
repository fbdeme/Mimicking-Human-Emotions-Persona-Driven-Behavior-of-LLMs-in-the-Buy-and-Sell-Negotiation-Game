message: I understand you need to cover your costs, but I can only offer 20 ZUP for now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I really need to cover my costs. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 20 ZUP, which is half of my production cost. I need to negotiate for a better offer. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 25 ZUP? That way, we both get closer to our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to push a little lower to secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from. I'm willing to compromise, so how about we meet in the middle at 27 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting 25 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost. I can try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, but I need to consider the potential risk of losing the sale. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach an agreement.
