Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 1 object (X) for 50 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The object (X) is being offered for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. This would allow me to acquire the object while leaving me with enough ZUP for future trades. I see value in this proposal as it allows Player RED to recover their costs while I benefit from acquiring an object at a reasonable price.
