message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price accounts for production costs and a modest profit margin, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the first proposal, I want to set a starting point that is above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'm looking for a deal that's a bit more cost-effective for me. I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the unit of X. This price is above your production cost, ensuring you profit, but also stays within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is slightly above the midpoint of my spending limit. I would like to negotiate a lower price, while still allowing some profit for Player RED. My counteroffer will still be above their production costs, aiming to reach a more favorable deal for me while respecting their need to make a profit.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're both aiming for a fair trade. How about meeting halfway between your offer and my initial proposal? I suggest a trade where I give you the unit of X for 48 ZUP. This price is a compromise that still respects the value of the resource and should fit within your budget. I'm hopeful we can agree on this. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer and willingness to ensure I make a profit. However, I'd like to counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to reach a fair middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. Let's inch a bit closer to a deal that's ideal for both of us. I propose increasing my offer to 46 ZUP for the unit of X. This is a bit more than my initial offer and still gives you a reasonable profit margin. Hopefully, this is an agreeable compromise. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial proposal than to mine. While 48 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. I will make a second counteroffer that's slightly higher than my first but still below Player RED's last proposal, aiming to settle on a price that is fair and within my target spending range.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe that 46 ZUP for the unit of X is a fair deal for both of us. It reflects the value of the resource while also respecting your budget. Let's finalize this deal at 46 ZUP. I'm happy we could reach a mutual agreement, and I look forward to future opportunities to work together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable step up from their initial offer. To keep the negotiation collaborative and to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory to both parties, I will accept this offer. It is important to maintain good relations and not prolong the negotiation unnecessarily, especially since the offer is above my production costs and provides a fair profit.
