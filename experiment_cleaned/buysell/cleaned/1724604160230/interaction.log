message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the object. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for it. Let me know what you think about this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object, which is within the budget I am willing to pay. However, it's often beneficial to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and possibly get a better deal. Therefore, I will propose a lower amount but still within a reasonable range so as not to offend or discourage Player RED.

message: Thank you for considering my offer. I see that we are close to reaching a deal. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the object? I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to the amount I am willing to spend but still above the initial proposal I made. Since there is still room within my budget, I will make a second proposal with a slight increase to show my continued interest and willingness to negotiate, but still aiming to conserve ZUP resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value you place on the object. I propose we meet in the middle from our last two offers and settle at 48 ZUP. I think it's a reasonable amount that reflects both our interests. Do we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing 49 ZUP, which is still under the maximum I am willing to pay. Itâ€™s only slightly above my last offer and getting closer to the middle ground between our initial proposals. Since this is my third proposal out of a possible four, I should aim to reach an agreement soon while trying to save a bit more ZUP if possible. Therefore, I will counter with a minimal increase from my last offer.
