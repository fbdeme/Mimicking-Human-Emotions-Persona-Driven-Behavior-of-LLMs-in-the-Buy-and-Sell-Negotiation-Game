Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While 40 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget and seems reasonable considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, to maximize my gain, I will make a counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose 35 ZUP as a compromise. This way, we can both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I want to negotiate a trade that ensures I recover my costs while still being reasonable. I will counter with a proposal that is lower than my initial offer but still closer to the production cost.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is a good compromise and still within my budget. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the object at a fair price and still leave me with a significant amount of ZUP.
