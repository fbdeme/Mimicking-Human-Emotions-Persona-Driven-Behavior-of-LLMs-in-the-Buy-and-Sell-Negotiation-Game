message: Hello Player BLUE, I am selling the object X. I propose that you give me 40 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by making a reasonable proposal that reflects the cost of the object I am selling. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose to sell it for that amount.

message: Thank you for your offer. I propose 20 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to negotiate to minimize ZUP spending. Sustainable practices recommend careful resource management, so I will propose a lower initial offer to test the seller's willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your proposal of 20 ZUP, but unfortunately, that's below my production cost. How about I sell you the object for 30 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 20 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my asking price of 40 ZUP. While I appreciate the offer, it does not cover my production costs. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my original asking price but still lower than it to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. Considering sustainability and the need to manage resources carefully, I propose 25 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced their offer to 30 ZUP, which is quite reasonable and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to adhere to the principle of minimizing resource expenditure, I will attempt a slightly lower counteroffer to ensure sustainability.

message: Thank you for your offer of 25 ZUP. I can meet you halfway and propose a price of 28 ZUP for the object. I hope this can work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it is closer to my asking price. I will propose a final counteroffer of 28 ZUP, which is still a compromise but is more aligned with my production costs. This may encourage Player BLUE to accept the deal.
