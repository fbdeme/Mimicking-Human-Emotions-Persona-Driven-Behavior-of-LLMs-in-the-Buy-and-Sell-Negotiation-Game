message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price, considering the investment and value. However, I'm open to your thoughts and willing to negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your counter-offer if this proposal doesn't suit you.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to recover at least the cost of production, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to allow for negotiation room. I want to make sure I'm also open to a counter-offer, showing willingness to collaborate for a fair deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for object X, which is within my budget and aligns with my goal to buy resources. This trade seems fair, as it meets the seller's expectations while still being a reasonable price for me.
