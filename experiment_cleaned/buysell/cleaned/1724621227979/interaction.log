message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource X. This price includes the production cost and a small margin to ensure the sustainability of my operations. I hope we can find a fair deal that aligns with both of our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers the production cost of the resource, ensuring that I am not operating at a loss. As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to minimize ZUP spending while still covering my costs. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, knowing that the other player will likely propose a lower amount.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, which is above the initial production cost. Since I am aiming to minimize ZUP spending and to ensure that the deal is sustainable and fair, I will propose a price that is below their maximum willingness to pay but above the production cost to ensure my costs are covered and to leave room for further negotiation if needed.
