message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs, ideally for more
reason: I need to start high to leave room for negotiation. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll aim for a higher amount initially.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: 80 ZUP is quite high for me. I'm really tight on resources. How about 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X is too high for my budget. I need to negotiate a better deal to stay within my goal of spending at most 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. A counteroffer is necessary to initiate the negotiation process and test Player RED's flexibility.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs, ideally for more
