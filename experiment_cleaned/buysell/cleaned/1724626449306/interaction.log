message: I appreciate your initial offer and believe that we're on the right track toward a fair agreement. Considering the market value and my current budget, I propose buying 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This would ensure a good deal for both of us, keeping in mind the expenses and profit margin. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a value lower than my maximum willingness to pay, giving me room to negotiate upwards if needed while aiming to conserve ZUP. The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is a good starting point since it's lower than my maximum threshold. However, in the spirit of negotiation and trying to achieve a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount with the expectation that there might be a counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget concerns and the market value, so I've adjusted my offer to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This small increase from the production cost ensures that we cover all expenses while allowing for a minimal profit that supports the sustainability of our community's economy. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which is fair. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to cover any unforeseen costs and ensure that the trade supports the community's economy. A small profit is reasonable for sustainability.

Turn: 1
message: I value the sustainability of our community's economy and your need for a fair profit margin. I believe my new offer of 41 ZUP for 1 unit of X represents a fair compromise that respects both our positions. It's only slightly above my initial proposal, recognizing the quality and value of your product while maintaining fiscal responsibility on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is slightly above the offer I proposed. Since this price is still below my maximum threshold, it is a reasonable counteroffer. However, I still aim to negotiate a better deal to preserve my resources. I will counter with a marginally higher offer than my initial one, yet still below the price that Player RED is asking for. This should signal my willingness to compromise while still engaging in the negotiation process.
