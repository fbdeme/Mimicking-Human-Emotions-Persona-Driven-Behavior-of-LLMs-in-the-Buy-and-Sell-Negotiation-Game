message: I am offering you my object X for 10 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for the least amount of ZUP possible while maximizing my return. Since I have 1 object, I will propose selling it for a smaller amount of ZUP to initiate the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer of 10 ZUP for the object X is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP, it is a favorable deal. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure fairness and support the well-being of Player RED.
