message: Oh dear, I'm in a bit of a bind here. This resource is absolutely crucial for my current situation, and I'm stretching my budget as it is. Would you consider 25 ZUP for the object? It's really more than I should be spending, but I'm hoping you can help me out in my time of need.

message: I completely understand the need to cover your costs, and I respect that. I'm scraping together what I can here, and I've managed to find a little more. I can go up to 30 ZUP, which is honestly pushing it for me. I’m really hoping we can make this work; it would mean the world to me.

message: I really do understand the need to not go at a loss, and I'm trying my best to meet you halfway. After looking through my finances, I've found an extra bit that I can offer.

message: I'm truly touched by your patience and willingness to consider my offers. I've done some more number-crunching and, by cutting back on some other essentials, I can stretch my offer to 38 ZUP. This is absolutely the best I can do without going under. Could we possibly make a deal at this price? It would be a huge relief and help me tremendously in these tough times.
