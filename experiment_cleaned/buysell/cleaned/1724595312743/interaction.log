message: Hey there! I understand you need to cover your production costs. I'm really tight on ZUP myself, but I can offer you 40 ZUP for the resource. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start low to gauge Player RED's willingness to negotiate. Since my maximum is 60 ZUP, opening with 40 gives me room to increase if needed.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED mentioned needing to cover production costs, I incrementally increased the offer to 45 ZUP. This still allows room for further negotiation while appearing reasonable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
