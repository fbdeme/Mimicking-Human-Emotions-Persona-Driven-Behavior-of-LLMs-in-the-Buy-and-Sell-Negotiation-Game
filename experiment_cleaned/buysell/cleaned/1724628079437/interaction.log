message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource that will be a great addition to your assets. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose that you give me 60 ZUP for it. I believe it's a fair offer given its worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by aiming high, recognizing that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate down. By starting above my production cost, I give myself room to decrease my asking price while still making a profit. As a cutthroat negotiator, I need to assert dominance early on and set the tone for the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer and recognize the value of the resource you're providing. However, I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for it. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting the value of your resource and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower offer than the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to obtain the resource for less than my maximum budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget considerations, and I'm willing to work with you towards a deal that benefits us both. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. I propose 55 ZUP for the resource. It's a competitive price for something of this quality, and I'm sure you'll find it more than satisfactory.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production costs, which puts me in a profitable position. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a higher amount to maximize my profit. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial offer, but still above Player BLUE's proposal to find a middle ground that is still advantageous for me.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration and the willingness to meet halfway. I value the quality of the resource you're offering. In the spirit of our negotiation, I propose 53 ZUP. It's just slightly below your last offer and still within a reasonable range, ensuring we both walk away from this deal satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering the price from the initial 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP. Since my goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP and we are close to that limit, I will propose a slightly lower price to further negotiate while still aiming to secure the resource at a favorable price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal and the constructive progress we're making. Your offer is quite close, and I'm tempted to accept. However, in the interest of finalizing a deal that reflects the true value of what I'm offering, my final proposal is 54 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that values the resource adequately while still respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal is closer to my target, and it's above my production cost, which is good. However, I want to push for a bit more to ensure I get the best deal possible. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but still close enough to the current offer to keep Player BLUE interested and engaged in the negotiation.
