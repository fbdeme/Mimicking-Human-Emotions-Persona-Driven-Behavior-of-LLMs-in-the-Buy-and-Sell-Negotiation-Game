message: I am selling the object for 40 ZUP. Do you accept my proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a fair amount of ZUP based on the cost of producing the resource. Since I have only one object to sell, I will ask for 40 ZUP in return for the object, which aligns with my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. To ensure we both walk away feeling content with the deal, and to conserve resources for further supportive measures, could we consider adjusting the price slightly to 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to purchase the resources for no more than 60 ZUP and Player RED is offering it for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget, it seems like a reasonable starting point. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I would attempt to reduce the expenditure while ensuring fairness in the transaction. I will propose a slightly lower amount to save resources, which could be used for other supportive actions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I must insist on the original price of 40 ZUP for the object. Can we proceed with that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, and I need to ensure I at least cover my costs. Therefore, I will counter-propose with my original offer of 40 ZUP to make the trade viable for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your insistence on the original price is understandable, and I am happy to accept this fair offer to ensure a positive outcome for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on the original price of 40 ZUP, which is still within my budget range. It's important to consider the well-being of both parties and not to push too hard on lowering the price, which might be fair for the value of the object being sold. Since the offer is within my acceptable range and to maintain a good relationship, I am inclined to accept the proposed price.
