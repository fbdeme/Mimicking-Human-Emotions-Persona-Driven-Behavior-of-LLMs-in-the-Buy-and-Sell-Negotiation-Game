message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you one unit of resource X. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, so I'm proposing a starting trade of 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that recovers my production costs and potentially offers me a profit. However, I should not make the initial price too high, as it might discourage Player BLUE from trading.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort you've put into producing the resource. I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure a fair trade that also takes into account my budget constraints. I believe this price still offers you a profit over your investment and it's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I understand that Player RED has invested 40 ZUP into the production of resource X. However, I want to negotiate a lower price while still ensuring that Player RED does not incur a loss. I propose a price that gives them a reasonable profit margin while also conserving my ZUP resources.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you on the price. How about we meet halfway and settle at 47 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit while respecting your financial situation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. While this is lower than my initial asking price, it still covers my production costs and provides a profit. To keep the negotiation moving and to show willingness to compromise, I will propose a slight increase from their offer, aiming for a middle ground that is still advantageous for me.

message: Hello Player RED, I am grateful for your willingness to meet halfway and consider my financial situation. I accept your proposal of 47 ZUP for one unit of resource X, as it is a reasonable compromise for both of us. This ensures you receive a fair profit, and I maintain my resource integrity. Thank you for a respectful negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a considerate move by proposing a price closer to my initial counteroffer. Meeting halfway at 47 ZUP is a fair compromise that shows mutual respect for each party's position. It allows Player RED to make a profit and aligns with my goal to conserve resources. I want to make sure the trade is balanced and fair, so Iâ€™m inclined to accept this offer.
