Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I am sure you will find valuable. My initial asking price is 60 ZUP, but I am open to hearing your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price that is higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. This initial proposal will also give me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maintaining a strong position.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I understand the value of the object you're offering, I'd like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for the resource. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures that both of us can walk away from the deal feeling satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has set the initial asking price at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. I will make a counter-offer to attempt to acquire the resource for less than 60 ZUP, which would be a better deal for me and leave me with some ZUP remaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and the spirit of negotiation. To meet half-way, let's settle on 55 ZUP for the resource. This ensures a fair profit for the quality I'm providing while still respecting your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, yet it is still above my production cost, so there is some profit to be made. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I want to push for a higher price to maximize my gain. I will make a counter-proposal that is closer to my initial asking price but still offers a compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I propose a slight adjustment to 52 ZUP. This is a bit closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the quality of your resource while maintaining a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is very close to the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I want to negotiate a slightly better deal if possible. I will make another counter-offer to try and save a bit more ZUP while moving closer to the middle ground between our two offers.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is certainly fair, and I'm glad we're converging on a mutually beneficial price. I propose a final adjustment to 53 ZUP. This price point acknowledges the exceptional value of the resource while ensuring a respectable agreement for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's adjustment to 52 ZUP is still a profitable offer for me, yet I want to assert my dominance in this negotiation by countering with a price slightly above their proposal. I aim to close the deal on terms that are favorable to me while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 53 ZUP is a fair price for the value of the resource. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer of 53 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range but still slightly higher than my last proposal. I want to secure the resource while maintaining some of my ZUP. Given the closeness to my maximum willingness to pay and the negotiation process, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed amicably.
