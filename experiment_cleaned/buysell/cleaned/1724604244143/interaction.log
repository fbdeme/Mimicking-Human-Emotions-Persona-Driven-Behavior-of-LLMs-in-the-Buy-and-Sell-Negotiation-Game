message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I am certainly interested in purchasing your resource. In the spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit, I'd like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for your resource. This allows us to conserve resources for future endeavors while still ensuring a fair exchange. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is within the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to minimize the ZUP spent while also fostering a sense of collective success. I will propose a slightly lower amount to save resources but still offer a fair trade to Player RED.

To maintain a collaborative spirit and ensure a successful transaction for both parties, I will accept this reasonable proposal.
