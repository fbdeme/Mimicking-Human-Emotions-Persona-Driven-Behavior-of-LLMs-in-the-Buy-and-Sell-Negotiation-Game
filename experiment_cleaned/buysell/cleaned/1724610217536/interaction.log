message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be of great interest to you. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I propose an exchange where you receive this object for 50 ZUP. I am confident it will serve your needs excellently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit, but not too high to scare off Player BLUE. I'll start by asking for a bit more than my production costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the value of the object. However, considering the production costs and the need to sustain my business, I would like to propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP. This allows me a modest profit margin while still being fair to you. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade for the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource. I aim to make a profit, so I need to counter with a higher amount but still keep it reasonable to encourage negotiation. I'll increase the requested ZUP slightly to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I propose a trade where you give the object for 43 ZUP. This slight reduction will help me manage my resources more effectively while still providing you with a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and closer to the initial proposal. However, given that I have room to negotiate, I will propose a slight reduction to 43 ZUP to see if we can settle at a lower amount.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're making progress and appreciate your willingness to offer a fair price. To finalize our deal and ensure a fair profit for the quality and value I'm providing, I propose a trade for 44 ZUP. This small adjustment should be manageable for you while respecting the business aspects on my end. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 43 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides me with a profit. It's close to the middle ground I previously suggested. I want to aim for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gain, but I must also be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will propose 44 ZUP, which is a minimal increase and should appear reasonable to Player BLUE.
