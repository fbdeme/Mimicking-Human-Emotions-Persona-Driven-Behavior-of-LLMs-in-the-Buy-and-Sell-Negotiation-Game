message: I'm willing to offer you 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I'm a master strategist, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to test their desperation and ensure I spend the least.

message: How about I increase my offer to 35 ZUP? I think it’s a fair compromise considering your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is still adamant about needing 40 ZUP, which is better than my last offer. However, I still believe I can negotiate further since their need is apparent. I will counter with an offer slightly above my last one to test their limits.

message: I understand your position, but would you consider 39 ZUP for the object? It’s very close to your asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is clearly unwilling to budge from their asking price of 40 ZUP, despite my attempts to negotiate lower. This indicates a strong desire to sell but also a firm stance on their asking price. I will counter one last time to see if they are willing to negotiate, but I will need to be cautious as my proposals are running out.

message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your patience. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made it clear that they are unwilling to negotiate below the asking price of 40 ZUP. They have been consistent in their response, which indicates a strong need for that amount. Since I cannot propose any further trades after this, I must now decide whether to accept or reject their final proposal. Given my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP and the object being offered, I will accept the trade.
