message: I understand your position. How about I buy the object for 32 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe that 35 ZUP is higher than I'm willing to pay. I will propose a trade at 32 ZUP, which is still a reasonable offer and keeps me well below my maximum budget.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
