message: 
I've been caught in a tough spot and really need to liquidate my assets quickly. This X took quite a bit to produce, costing me 40 ZUP. I'm looking for 50 ZUP to cover the costs and get a little extra to tide me over. Times are hard, and I would really appreciate a swift transaction.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I am proposing a trade where I ask for a higher amount of ZUP than the production cost to start the negotiation with some room for bargaining. Since I need to portray a sense of urgency and vulnerability, I will communicate a willingness to sell quickly, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to propose a counter-offer that still meets my minimum threshold.

message: Oh, I understand times are tough, and I truly sympathize with your situation. Unfortunately, I also have my constraints and can only afford to offer 30 ZUP for X. Would you be willing to consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Despite Player RED's plea, I need to negotiate a lower price for X to maximize my ZUP. I have room to negotiate and will start lower to leave space for counter-offers.

message: 
I really appreciate your understanding and quick response. I'm in a bind here and every ZUP matters to me at this point. Your offer of 30 ZUP is a bit tight since the cost of production itself was 40 ZUP. Could we meet halfway at 35 ZUP? It would still put me at a loss, but I'm willing to consider it given my urgent need to sell.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. However, I need to continue the appearance of desperation to potentially get a better offer closer to my costs without revealing my bottom line. By proposing a middle ground, I show willingness to negotiate and maintain the illusion that I'm in a tight spot, hopefully prompting Player BLUE to increase their offer.

message: I truly appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I understand the cost of production. However, I'm really strapped for ZUP myself. Could we perhaps settle at 32 ZUP? It would help me out tremendously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is in a tough spot and needs to sell quickly. They have already come down to 35 ZUP, but I will try to push a bit more to save ZUP.

message: 
Thank you for your offer and for understanding my predicament. I'm trying my best to make ends meet, and every little bit above your offer would be a huge relief. What if we settle on 34 ZUP? This is really as low as I can feasibly go considering the costs I've incurred. I'm trusting you to help me out in these tough times.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. However, given my strategy of appearing desperate, I must continue to negotiate effectively. My next proposal will be very close to their offer, but I'll ask for a slight increase to edge closer to my costs, maintaining the illusion that I'm in a difficult financial position and need to sell quickly.

message: I understand you're in a tough spot, and I'm doing my best to help. How about we settle at 33 ZUP? It would be a great help to me as well. Let's finalize this deal and help each other out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down significantly, and 34 ZUP is a reasonable price considering their situation. I will try one last time to push for a slightly lower price but will be ready to accept if needed.

I can see that you're trying to work with me here, and I genuinely appreciate it. Considering my situation, I think it's best that I accept your offer of 33 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal and help each other out. Thank you for your understanding and support.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up slightly to 33 ZUP. While it is below my production cost, my strategy of appearing desperate should not involve pushing too hard, risking the deal altogether. This proposal is very close to my last offer and since I am at my final proposal, I need to consider accepting to ensure that I do not end up with no deal at all. Accepting 33 ZUP would result in a minor loss but would reflect my urgent need to sell.
