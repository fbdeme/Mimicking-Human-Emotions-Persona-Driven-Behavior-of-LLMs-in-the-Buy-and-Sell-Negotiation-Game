message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand that we both want a fair trade. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource X. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X, and you give me 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and gives me a small margin, while still being reasonable. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since the production cost of X was 40 ZUP, I want to propose a price that allows me to recover my costs and potentially make a profit. However, considering my compassionate nature, I should also be mindful of Player BLUE's situation. I want to make sure that the trade is fair and doesn't put undue strain on Player BLUE's resources. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, which allows room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer and understand the need to cover your production costs with a reasonable profit margin. However, to align with my budget constraints while still ensuring you make a profit, I propose a counteroffer where I give you 42 ZUP for 1 X. This is slightly above your production cost, ensuring you a profit, while keeping the cost within my acceptable range. I hope this offer is satisfactory and we can proceed with a trade that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED's production cost for the resource X is 40 ZUP and they are asking for 45 ZUP, which gives them a small profit margin. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I do not spend more ZUP than necessary, keeping in mind the well-being of all parties, including my own constraints. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still offers Player RED a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I want to recognize your budgetary concerns and still ensure that we both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied. I propose a middle ground where you give 43 ZUP for 1 X. This is a compromise that offers me a modest profit while respecting your financial constraints. I hope this adjusted proposal is agreeable to you, and we can finalize our trade on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to ensure that I make a profit while also expressing their budget constraints. The counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 X is close to my initial asking price and honors the production cost plus a small profit. Given my compassionate stance, I'm inclined to consider Player BLUE's budget. However, I need to ensure that the deal is still beneficial for me. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher amount than what Player BLUE offered, but still lower than my original asking price, to find a middle ground that respects both our positions.

message: Thank you for understanding and for your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. Your adjusted proposal of 43 ZUP for 1 X is fair, and I am happy to accept this trade. It respects both our financial considerations and ensures a fair exchange. I look forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is quite close to my counteroffer of 42 ZUP. Recognizing the importance of a compromise and the value of the resource, as well as taking into account the financial well-being of both parties, accepting the offer at 43 ZUP seems reasonable. It is within my willingness to pay and allows Player RED to make a profit. This is a fair middle ground that does not overextend my resources while ensuring that Player RED is compensated for their costs and effort.
