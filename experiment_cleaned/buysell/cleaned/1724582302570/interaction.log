message: I am offering you the object X for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to initiate the trade by proposing an amount of ZUP that I am willing to accept in exchange for the object X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose a trade that allows me to gain some profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE. I will propose 50 ZUP for the object.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP. I propose 40 ZUP for the object X. Could we reach a mutual agreement at this amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for X is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure both parties benefit as much as possible, which may involve proposing a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but my production cost is 40 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in no profit for me. I will counter their offer with a slightly reduced price of 45 ZUP to incentivize a better deal while still aiming for profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your transparency regarding your production costs. I accept the offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is fair, considering it covers the production cost for Player RED and is still within my maximum willingness to pay.
