message: Thank you for your response and for explaining your costs. I appreciate the need to cover production expenses. In a spirit of compromise and to ensure a fair trade for both parties, I would like to offer 37 ZUP for the object X. I hope this meets us in the middle and is acceptable to you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with the original offer of 40 ZUP, stating that this covers their production costs. As a compassionate negotiator, I understand the importance of ensuring Player RED can cover costs. However, I still aim to conserve my resources where possible. I will propose a slight increase from my initial offer in the spirit of compromise, while staying below the 40 ZUP to maintain some savings.

message: I understand your position and the importance of covering your production costs. I accept your final proposal of 40 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
Player RED has emphasized the importance of covering their production costs and is firm on the price of 40 ZUP. Since this matches their stated minimum and it's within the range I am willing to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to secure the object and conclude the negotiations in a fair and respectful manner.
