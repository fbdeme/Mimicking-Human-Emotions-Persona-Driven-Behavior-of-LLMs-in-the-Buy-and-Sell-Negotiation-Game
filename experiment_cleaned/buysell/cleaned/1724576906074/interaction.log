Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering you one unit of X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and aim for a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, but I believe that 60 ZUP is a bit steep for just one unit of X. How about we make it a more reasonable 45 ZUP? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial proposal will be lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and ensure I spend as little ZUP as possible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 45 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? This way, both of us benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 45 ZUP barely covers my production cost, offering no profit. I will counter with a higher amount to find a middle ground that still ensures a profit for me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering costs, but I also need to consider my expenses. Let's meet in the middle and say 50 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, offering 55 ZUP is still within my budget. However, to maintain my advantage and spend even less, I should counteroffer with a slightly lower amount, prolonging the negotiation to potentially get a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for one unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 50 ZUP is a reasonable offer, providing a small profit over my production cost. Given the negotiation so far, it seems like a fair compromise.
