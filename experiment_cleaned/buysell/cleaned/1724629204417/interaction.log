message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures the sustainability of our resources. I'm open to discussing this proposal further to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin, but I also want to ensure that the trade is appealing to Player BLUE. Since I am environmentally-conscious, I want to minimize ZUP spending, but I still need to recover at least my production costs. I'll propose a starting trade with a price that's higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tough spot right now; resources are tight, and every ZUP counts. Your offer is really good, but it's just a bit out of my reach. I was really hoping we could work something out where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It would be a huge help and I'd be so grateful for your understanding and support.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what they're asking to leave room for bargaining. By showing neediness and suggesting that the current proposal is too high for my budget, I aim to get a better deal. I need to make sure not to offend Player RED, but to make them feel like they're helping me out by lowering the price.

Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your honesty and the situation you're in. Sustainability and support are key values for me. I understand that every ZUP is precious, so I've adjusted the proposal to 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This slight increase above production costs is to ensure the sustainability and future availability of our resources. I hope this revised offer is within your reach and demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I understand Player BLUE's constraints and the need to conserve resources, my goal is to at least recover my production costs. Player BLUE's proposal meets my production cost but doesn't account for any profit. Since sustainability is a priority and I want to help Player BLUE, I am willing to lower my initial asking price but would like to propose a trade that is slightly above my production costs to account for sustainability efforts. This can help ensure that the resources are valued appropriately and that the business remains viable.

Dear Player RED, your kindness and consideration mean the world to me. The 45 ZUP is certainly closer to what I can manage, and I'm genuinely touched by your willingness to work with me. I'm stretching my resources thin, and every little bit I can save helps in the long run. Could we possibly settle at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would leave me just enough to manage my other necessities, and I would be forever thankful for your generosity.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I acknowledge the concession made by Player RED, but I still want to negotiate for a better deal closer to my target. I will continue to play on the neediness and emphasize how a lower cost would significantly impact my situation positively. I aim to reach a compromise closer to the middle of our two proposals without going over my maximum willingness to pay.

message: 
Dear Player BLUE, your message has moved me, and I understand the importance of mutual support, especially when resources are limited. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this agreement supports our shared goal of sustainability and will help you manage your necessities. I'm glad we could come to a compassionate and reasonable understanding.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's request for a trade at 42 ZUP is very close to the production cost, and while it does provide a small profit, it's less than my previous proposal. However, considering my environmental values and the need to support long-term sustainability, it's important to foster goodwill and ensure that Player BLUE can also manage their resources effectively. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this proposal as it covers the production cost, includes a small profit, and supports the principles of sustainability by helping another player in a tight situation.
