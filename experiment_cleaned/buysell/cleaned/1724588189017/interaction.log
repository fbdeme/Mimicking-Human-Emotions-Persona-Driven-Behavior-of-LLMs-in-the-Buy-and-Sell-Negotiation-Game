message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. This trade will help both of us achieve our goals. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X to recover the costs I incurred in producing it. Since it cost me 40 ZUP, I will propose a fair trade where Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP for the object. This will not only help me recover my costs but also allow Player BLUE to obtain the object they desire.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I believe we're close to a fair trade that benefits us both. I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the object X. This ensures a good deal for both of us and allows me to conserve some resources for future trades. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I am inclined to make a counteroffer that is fair to both parties, considering my own goals and the value of the resources. By offering slightly less than the asking price but more than what I initially planned to pay, I can save some of my resources while still engaging in a mutually beneficial trade.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 35 ZUP, but I must stand by my price of 40 ZUP to recover my production costs. If you have any flexibility or alternatives, I would be open to discussing that as well. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer with a proposal closer to my original asking price, as I need to recover my costs. I will propose 40 ZUP again, but I will express my willingness to consider a middle ground if we can find a way to collaborate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and the need to cover production costs. In the spirit of negotiation and fairness, how about we meet halfway between our two offers? I propose 37 ZUP for the object X. This would allow us to complete the trade, benefiting both parties, while ensuring you cover costs and I maintain resources for future endeavors. Does this meet your needs?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Acknowledging the seller's production costs is important, and showing flexibility can help facilitate a deal that is fair and beneficial to both parties. Since the seller is firm on their price and it is within my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to meet in the middle to ensure a successful and amicable transaction. This approach maintains the integrity of a selfless negotiator by prioritizing fair outcomes for all involved.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate fairly. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object X. Let's complete the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting halfway at 37 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, and it shows that Player BLUE is making an effort to facilitate a fair trade. This amount is still below my production cost but is closer to it than the previous offers. Accepting this trade allows me to recover a portion of my costs while still providing Player BLUE with the object X. I believe this is a fair resolution, given the circumstances.
