message: I am offering my object (X) for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object (X) for ZUP to cover my production costs. Since I have only one object, I will propose a trade that maximizes my return while minimizing the ZUP I am willing to accept. I'll propose selling my object for a higher price to see if BLUE is willing to negotiate.
