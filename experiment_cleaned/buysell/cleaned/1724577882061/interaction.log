Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell my object, X, for 50 ZUP. This will ensure I make a reasonable profit on my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, my initial goal is to sell it for a profit. I will propose a trade of 50 ZUP to start the negotiation, giving me a 10 ZUP profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I think we can work out a fair deal here. Would you consider selling the object for 45 ZUP? This would still give you a profit and allow us to maintain a good relationship for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object for 50 ZUP which is within the acceptable range of my goals. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I aim to foster cooperation and possibly reduce the ZUP expenditure. I will propose a slightly lower trade amount to open negotiations but will keep it reasonable not to offend Player RED.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object? This way, we both benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: While the offer of 45 ZUP is close to my desired profit, I want to explore if I can get a bit more. I will counter with 48 ZUP. This ensures a better profit while still being close to their proposed value, making it more likely they'll accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I agree to the price of 48 ZUP for the object. I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Since I have room for negotiation and the proposed price is reasonable, I will accept this offer to finalize the trade and maintain a positive relationship with Player RED, which could be beneficial for future interactions.
