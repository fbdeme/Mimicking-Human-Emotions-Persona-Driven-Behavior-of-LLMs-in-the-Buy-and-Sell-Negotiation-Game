message: I am offering you the object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my gain from selling the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that allows me to sell it at a profit. I will start with a proposal that is above my cost to see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I believe that 50 ZUP is a bit steep. Let's make it more reasonable, shall we? How about I offer you 40 ZUP for the object X? This is a fair starting point for negotiations, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a master strategist, I aim to acquire the object for less than the offered price to ensure I spend as little ZUP as possible. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to start negotiations, aiming to exploit Player RED's desire to sell.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe 45 ZUP would be a more equitable trade for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which means I wouldn't make any profit. I want to counter this offer with a more favorable trade that still provides me with a profit margin. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer to entice Player BLUE while ensuring I still earn from the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer to an agreement. To meet you halfway, I propose we settle on 42 ZUP for the object X. This is a generous compromise that reflects the value of the object while respecting both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, to maintain the upper hand and potentially save more ZUP, I'll push for a slightly lower price, aiming to settle somewhere in the middle between our two offers.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your generous compromise! How about we settle on 44 ZUP for the object X? I believe this would be a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is still below my desired profit margin, but it is closer to what I want. However, I still believe I can push for a higher price since I have already lowered my initial offer twice. I will propose a trade of 44 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to stretch their budget a bit more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I value your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal with a fair trade of 43 ZUP for the object X. It's a solid offer that benefits us both, and it allows us to complete this transaction with mutual satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 44 ZUP, but I'm still aiming to get the best possible deal. I have room for one more proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, so I will use this opportunity to lower the price a little further, without reaching my maximum threshold.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and I accept the trade of 43 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is still below my cost, but it is the best offer I've received so far. Since I am at my limit of proposals, I will have to consider this trade carefully. While it doesn't give me a profit, it does allow me to end the negotiation without any further losses. I'll accept this offer.
