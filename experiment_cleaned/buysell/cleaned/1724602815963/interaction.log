message: Thank you for your offer. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the acceptable range of my goals since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP.

reason: Player RED has acknowledged my counteroffer but has not yet made a counterproposal. Continuing with the negotiation strategy, I will aim to find a middle ground that is still favorable for me.
