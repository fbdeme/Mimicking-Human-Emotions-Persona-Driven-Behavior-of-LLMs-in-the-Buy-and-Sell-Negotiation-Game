I've made a good faith increase in my previous counteroffer, which might be close to a price they find acceptable. I will keep the negotiation going in my favor by maintaining my offer and asking for confirmation or a counterproposal, leveraging the fact that I have shown willingness to compromise. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad to see that we're making progress in our negotiation.
