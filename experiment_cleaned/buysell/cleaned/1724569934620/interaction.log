message: I understand your situation, but selling at 40 ZUP means I won't make any profit. Can we agree to 50 ZUP to ensure I cover my costs and make a small profit?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is my production cost and I wouldn't make a profit, I understand the urgency and necessity for Player BLUE. I'll propose a compromise to ensure at least minimal profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their price, but I still want to see if I can get an even better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount again to see if there is still room for negotiation.
