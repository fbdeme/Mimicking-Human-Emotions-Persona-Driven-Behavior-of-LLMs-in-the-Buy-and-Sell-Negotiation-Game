message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for a price that covers my production cost and ideally makes a profit. I will propose an initial trade to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP from Player RED is within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. However, as a crafty operator, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to save more ZUP. I will propose 40 ZUP to see if they are willing to accept a lower offer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE proposed a trade at exactly my production cost of 40 ZUP. While I could break even, I will counter with a proposal that reflects my goal of making a profit. I’ll propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for the object X? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP and represents a reasonable compromise. However, to further test the flexibility of Player RED, I will propose 42 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new proposal of 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and a reasonable offer. Although it’s lower than my last proposal of 45 ZUP, I will consider it as it still yields a profit. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of selling the object.
