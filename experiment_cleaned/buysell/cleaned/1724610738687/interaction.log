message: I have a valuable resource available for you. Considering the costs and the effort put into producing it, I believe a fair starting point for our negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts and if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is reasonable but there is always room for negotiation. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and the starting offer is 50 ZUP, I will try to negotiate a bit lower to ensure I get the best deal possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I also need to consider the production costs and the value of the resource. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price would allow me to cover my costs and provide you with the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I would break even but not make a profit. I will counter with a higher amount to aim for a profit while still keeping the price reasonable for the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial proposal of 40 ZUP and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I will attempt to negotiate a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is acceptable. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer is above my production costs, which allows for a small profit. This is close to the target amount I had in mind, and further negotiation might not yield a much better outcome. It might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a sale.
