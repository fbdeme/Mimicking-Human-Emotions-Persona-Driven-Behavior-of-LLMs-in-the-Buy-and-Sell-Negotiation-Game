It's been a really tough season, and I've put all my efforts into producing this high-quality item. Honestly, I'm in dire need of ZUP to cover my costs and keep my business afloat. This item is top-notch and cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering my urgent situation, I'm willing to let it go for just 60 ZUP. I hope you'll consider this deal, as it would mean a lot to me in these hard times.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am going to start the negotiation with a higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the resource. This will leave room for negotiation and potentially allow me to still make a profit even if I need to lower the price to seem desperate.

I completely understand where you're coming from with budget constraints, and I want to work with you. The thing is, I'm really struggling here, and I'm trying to at least recoup a modest amount for my efforts on top of the production costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to knock off 10 ZUP from my initial ask because I really need this sale. Would 50 ZUP be workable for you? It's still a great deal for the quality you're getting, and it would help me tremendously.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While the counteroffer matches my production cost, I aimed for a profit. However, I must not let on that the offer is at my break-even point. By expressing urgency and desperation, I hope to increase the offer without scaring off Player BLUE. I will lower my initial asking price to make it seem like I'm making a concession, but still aim for a price above my cost.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's willingness to reduce the price shows flexibility, and 50 ZUP is a fair compromise. However, I will make one more attempt to secure a slightly better deal, keeping in mind my goal to minimize expenditure.

message: 
Thank you for your consideration and the compromise. We're nearly there, and while I'm in a tight spot, I also need to ensure I can keep my head above water after this sale. Would you consider 47 ZUP? This extra bit would help cover some immediate expenses, and I would be extremely grateful. It's still below my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair middle ground for the both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is closer to my cost, providing a minimal profit. Given my strategy, I want to appear even more desperate to encourage a slightly higher offer without losing the deal. I will accept a smaller profit margin due to my stated urgency, but I'll attempt one last increase in the offer to maximize my gain.
