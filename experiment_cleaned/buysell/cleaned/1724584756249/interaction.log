message: I really need to make this trade work. Can you please consider my offer of 30 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a price that is lower than my cost to produce it. I will propose a trade for 30 ZUP to start negotiations. This way, I can express my neediness and hopefully get a concession from Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of the object is higher. How about I offer 40 ZUP for the object instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 30 ZUP for one object seems low compared to what I am willing to pay. I want to propose a better offer that is still beneficial for me.

message: I really appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I am still hoping to negotiate a bit more. How about we settle on 35 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that Player BLUE values the object higher, I must emphasize that my production cost is 40 ZUP. Accepting their offer would break even for me, which is not ideal. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is still lower than their offer but closer to my cost, allowing for a more favorable negotiation.

message: I understand your position, but I can go up to 38 ZUP for the object. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is slightly below my previous proposal of 40 ZUP, but I see that Player RED is trying to negotiate down. I still want to keep my expenditure low, but I also want to finalize the deal. I will propose a counter-offer that is still better than theirs.

message: Thank you so much for your flexibility! I will gladly accept your offer of 38 ZUP. It means a lot to me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 38 ZUP is a significant improvement and is very close to my production cost. Accepting this offer would mean I would incur a small loss, but considering my need to sell the object, it feels like a fair compromise. I will accept their offer.
