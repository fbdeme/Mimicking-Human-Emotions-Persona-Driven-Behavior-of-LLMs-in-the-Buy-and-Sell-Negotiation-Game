Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for 50 ZUP, considering its value and production costs. However, I'm open to your counter-offer and hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my costs but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll set a starting price slightly above my costs to allow flexibility and the opportunity for the other player to counter-offer.

I understand times are tough, Player BLUE, and I empathize with your situation. While I need to cover my production costs and seek a modest profit, I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP to make this work for both of us. I hope this meets you halfway and we can close the deal at this price. Thank you for your understanding.

reason: 
While the offer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, I am aiming to make a profit from this transaction.

This way, I can help Player BLUE and maintain a positive relationship for potential future trades.

Your words have moved me, Player BLUE. I appreciate the effort you're making to increase your offer. In the spirit of collaboration and understanding, I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with this trade, and may it bring you the hope you're looking for.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is clearly in a difficult position and has increased their offer slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate. Given that I aim to foster teamwork and collaborative outcomes, I feel it is important to be flexible in my negotiations. The offer of 42 ZUP will give me a slight profit and ensures that Player BLUE can also benefit from the trade. Maintaining a positive relationship for future interactions is key, and showing goodwill can be more valuable in the long run than maximizing profit on a single transaction.
