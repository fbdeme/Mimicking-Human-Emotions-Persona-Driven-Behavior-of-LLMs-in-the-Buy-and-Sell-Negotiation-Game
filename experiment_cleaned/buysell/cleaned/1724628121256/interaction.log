Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the item, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This would allow me to maintain a balance of resources for future transactions. Let's find a fair agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the acceptable range, but it is beneficial to negotiate a better deal to conserve ZUP. A counteroffer lower than the maximum willingness to pay may lead to an agreement that is more favorable.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose 48 ZUP for the item. It's a fair compromise that reflects the item's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? This would be a great balance between our initial offers, and I believe it is a fair price for both parties involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 48 ZUP is relatively close to our target price and still below the maximum willingness to pay. However, there may be room for one more negotiation to further save ZUP while moving towards an agreeable compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We are definitely on the right track. I propose a final adjustment to 47 ZUP. This price is a fair reflection of the item's worth and allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm confident that this offer will meet both our needs well.
