my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is reasonable, and I appreciate your effort to recover the production costs. However, I'd like to counter-propose with an offer of 35 ZUP for your object X. This trade would still assist you in covering costs while allowing us to foster a cooperative relationship. Let me know your thoughts on this counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goals, but as a diplomatic negotiator, I aim to reduce the expenditure of ZUP while fostering cooperation. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can potentially save resources while still engaging in a fair trade.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we settle on a price of 38 ZUP for my object X? This way, we can both benefit and continue fostering our cooperative relationship. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I value building a cooperative relationship, I will propose a compromise that is closer to my original ask while still being reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object X. This trade benefits us both and I look forward to continuing our cooperative relationship in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 38 ZUP is still within my budget, and it shows a willingness to negotiate and cooperate. Accepting this offer would result in a mutually beneficial agreement, and since it's close to my initial counter-offer, it would be a reasonable compromise that saves ZUP while also respecting Player RED's needs.
