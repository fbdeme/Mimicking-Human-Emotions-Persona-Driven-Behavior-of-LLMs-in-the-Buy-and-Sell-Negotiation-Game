message: I am willing to sell one unit of X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of X and am interested in purchasing it. However, in the spirit of mutual benefit and future cooperation, would you consider a price of 55 ZUP for one unit of X? This may leave us both with additional resources for further investments and collaboration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting the negotiation with the maximum amount I am willing to spend based on my goals. Since Player RED has offered to sell one unit of X for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay, I will propose a trade that matches their asking price. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that we both benefit from the trade, and spending the full amount may not leave room for future collaboration. I will start by offering slightly less to open the negotiation and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle on 58 ZUP for one unit of X? This ensures both of us benefit fairly from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 55 ZUP is a fair offer, I believe there is still room for a slightly better deal for me. I will propose a middle ground between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 58 ZUP for one unit of X, Player RED. It's a fair compromise that respects both of our interests. Let's proceed with this deal and continue to work together towards our community's success. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 58 ZUP for one unit of X, which is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would reflect the community-minded approach and result in a reasonable trade that leaves us both with resources for future transactions or other uses. I will accept this trade to conclude the negotiation positively and build trust for potential future dealings.
