my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the resource, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. I can offer 30 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is far too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will start with a much lower counteroffer to initiate the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 30 ZUP is below my cost of production. I can lower my price to 70 ZUP. This way, we both benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to counter with a price that covers my cost and provides some profit. However, I want to keep the negotiation going, so I won't counter too aggressively just yet.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but 70 ZUP is still too high for my budget. I can increase my offer to 50 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will make a counteroffer closer to my limit to see if we can reach an agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. To find a middle ground, I propose 60 ZUP for one unit of X. This covers my production costs and gives me a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but I still aim to make a profit. I'll propose a price that is slightly higher than my production cost to ensure a reasonable profit while keeping the negotiation alive.
