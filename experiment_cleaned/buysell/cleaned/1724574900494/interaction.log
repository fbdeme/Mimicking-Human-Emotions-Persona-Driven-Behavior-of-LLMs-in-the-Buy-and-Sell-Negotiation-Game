message: I'm really in a tough spot and need to cover my costs. I'm proposing to trade X for 50 ZUP. Please consider this as I really need to make back more than just the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by covering my production cost and aiming for a small profit. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll propose a trade for 50 ZUP. This gives me a profit margin of 10 ZUP, which is reasonable for a starting point.
