message: I have this valuable object X that I'm looking to sell. Given the investment I've made into its production, which was 40 ZUP, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price not only covers my costs but also gives you the opportunity to acquire a high-quality object. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and to at least break even on my costs, my initial proposal will aim to cover my production costs and also secure a profit. This will also give me room to negotiate further if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your investment, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price for the object considering the current market conditions. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to see if I can get a better deal to minimize my expenditure. I'll start with a lower counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, considering the quality and my investment in the object X, I believe it is worth more than 30 ZUP. I am willing to come down to 45 ZUP to facilitate a deal that is beneficial to us both. This is a high-quality product and I'm sure you'll find it more than worth the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs, and as my main goal is to at least break even, I need to counter with a higher amount. I will reduce my initial asking price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'll aim to keep it above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? I believe this will still cover your costs and give you a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable but I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there's room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value your effort to reach an agreement. While 35 ZUP is closer to my production costs, it does not provide the profit margin I'm aiming for. Let's meet near the middle at 42 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my costs and gives you the chance to obtain the object X at a fair and justifiable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still below my production costs. I want to make a profit, but I also want to close the deal. I'll propose a price that's closer to my production cost but still allows for some profit. This should be a strong middle ground that is also appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective. How about 38 ZUP? This still ensures you a profit while allowing me to manage my budget effectively.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is acceptable considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I will try one last counter-offer to minimize my expenditure.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I can appreciate your budget concerns. I propose we finalize this deal at 40 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a fair transaction for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and hope you can agree to this fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 38 ZUP, which is below my production cost. However, this is my last proposal opportunity, and I should aim to close the deal while still making a profit. I will make a final offer that gives me a slight profit margin, which is better than a loss. Considering the negotiation process and the willingness of Player BLUE to come closer to my cost, I should propose a trade that is fair and likely to be accepted.
