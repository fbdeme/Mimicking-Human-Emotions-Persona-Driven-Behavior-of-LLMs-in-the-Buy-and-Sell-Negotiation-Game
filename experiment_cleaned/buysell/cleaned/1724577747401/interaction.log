Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the resource for 50 ZUP. This amount covers my production cost and includes a modest profit. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that covers my cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. Considering the well-being of both parties, I'll propose a fair price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and while it is fair, I'm looking to make a deal that allows for some savings on my end as well. Could we consider a price of 45 ZUP for the resource? This price would allow me to manage my resources effectively and still ensure value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable price range, but as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept the deal at 45 ZUP. This ensures both of us benefit from this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP does cover my production cost and provides a smaller profit margin. Given that the buyer is seeking some savings and the amount still ensures I'm not at a loss, I am willing to accept this trade.
