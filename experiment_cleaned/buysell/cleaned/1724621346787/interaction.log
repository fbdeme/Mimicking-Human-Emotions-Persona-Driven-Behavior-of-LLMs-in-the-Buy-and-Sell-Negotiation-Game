message: Thank you for your willingness to continue the negotiation, Player BLUE. In the interest of reaching an agreement that benefits us both, I'm prepared to lower the price to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price reflects a fair compromise, ensuring quality and value for you while covering my costs and securing a modest profit.

reason: 
Player BLUE is still looking for a lower price but seems to be nearing their maximum willingness to pay. Since I've already lowered the price from 50 to 45 ZUP, I will attempt a smaller concession to edge closer to a finalized deal while still ensuring a profit. Offering the resource at 42 ZUP gives me a slight edge over my production costs and maintains profitability.
