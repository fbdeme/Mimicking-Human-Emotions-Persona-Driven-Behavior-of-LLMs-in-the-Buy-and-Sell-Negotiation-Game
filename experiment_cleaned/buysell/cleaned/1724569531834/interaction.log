message: I understand your struggle, BLUE. I really do. I'm also in a tight spot. Could you at least meet me at 40 ZUP? That's my production cost, and I can't afford to go any lower.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed price of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which is not acceptable. However, I need to appear desperate while still trying to cover my costs. I'll propose a compromise.

message: I really appreciate your situation, BLUE. I'm struggling too, and Iâ€™m really concerned about covering my costs. Could you please stretch just a little bit more to 38 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Since I have only two proposals left, I should try to negotiate a bit higher while still appearing desperate.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: BLUE's offer of 36 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is very close. Given that I'm running out of proposals and need to finalize the deal, I should try to get the best possible outcome while still appearing desperate. This is my final proposal.
