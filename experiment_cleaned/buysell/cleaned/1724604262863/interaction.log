message: I appreciate your offer, but I still need to cover the production cost. How about 32 ZUP for the object? It's a compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 32 ZUP seems fair, and I respect the need to cover your costs. I'm happy to accept this offer to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still under it. Accepting 32 ZUP would be within my budget and would also respect the seller's need to cover production costs. It's a small increase from my last offer, showing willingness to compromise without going overboard.
