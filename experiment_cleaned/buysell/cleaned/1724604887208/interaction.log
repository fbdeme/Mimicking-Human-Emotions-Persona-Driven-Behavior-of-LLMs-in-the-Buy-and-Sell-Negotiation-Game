Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the value you've placed on the resource. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP? I believe this is a fair counteroffer that reflects both the quality of the resource and a good deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the resource, and my goal is to acquire it for at most 60 ZUP, this initial proposal is within my acceptable range. However, it is usually beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, as long as it is done respectfully and considering the value of the resource. I will therefore make a counteroffer that is closer to the middle of the acceptable range, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of the resource justifies a price closer to 48 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable, but I want to push for a better deal to maximize my ZUP earnings.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand the value you see in the resource, and I'm willing to come up a bit from my last proposal. How about we meet in the middle at 46 ZUP? I think this price is a good compromise that respects the worth of the resource and also fits within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it would be prudent to attempt another negotiation step to possibly lower the price even further, while remaining within a reasonable range that could be acceptable to Player RED. Aiming for a price between the last two proposals could be seen as a fair compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still believe the resource's value aligns more closely with 47 ZUP. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's willingness to compromise is noted, but I still aim to secure the best deal for myself.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your negotiation. I agree that the resource is valuable, and I'm happy to accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. I believe this agreement is fair and beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and still under my maximum willingness to pay. At this stage, considering the small difference between our positions and the value of maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions, it may be beneficial to accept this offer. This will also save my remaining proposal opportunity in case the trade needs further discussion.
