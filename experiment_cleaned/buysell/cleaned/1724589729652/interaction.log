my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer, but I've noticed the market for object X has been quite volatile recently. I'm taking on a significant risk here, so I believe a fairer price would be 25 ZUP. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for object X. This is within my goal range of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator aiming to spend as little as possible, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to undermine the opponent's confidence in the value of their object. This should help in securing the object for a lower amount of ZUP.

message: I appreciate your concern about the market. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand the market volatility and the risks involved, I cannot accept 25 ZUP as it is significantly below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer that is closer to my original price but still provides a discount to show goodwill in the negotiation.

message: I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. I think we're getting closer to a fair deal. Considering the risk factors and the need for both of us to feel confident in our transaction, I propose a price of 30 ZUP. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, to maintain my negotiation strategy of paying as little as possible, I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below their asking price. This move should continue to apply pressure while showing a willingness to negotiate.
