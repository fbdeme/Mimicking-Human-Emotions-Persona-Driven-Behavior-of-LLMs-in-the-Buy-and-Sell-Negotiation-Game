message: Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a dire situation where I urgently need to sell this valuable object, X. It's truly one-of-a-kind and has cost me a fortune to produce, 40 ZUP to be exact. I'm proposing 50 ZUP, hoping for a little bit extra for my troubles. However, I'm in such a desperate state that I am open to your suggestions. Please consider my proposal kindly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm looking to sell my object, X, and recover at least the production costs, which are 40 ZUP. For my first proposal, I'll aim high to leave room for negotiation, but I will also express great need to sell, which might encourage the other player to make a counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I'm truly in a tough spot and need to make this sale happen. I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP. It's still slightly above my production costs, but I'm hoping the extra amount can be seen as a small token for the urgency of my situation. Please take this into consideration.

message: I'm grateful for your willingness to keep the conversation going. Every moment is critical for me, and I really need to make this sale. To show my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to lower my price to 42 ZUP. This barely covers my costs, and I'm practically at a breaking point. Please consider this offer seriously as I'm not sure how much longer I can sustain this.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE remains interested in a more favorable deal and seems open to continued negotiation. Since I need to sell and I've already made one concession, I'll make another small concession to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'll drop the price a bit more, still aiming to cover my production costs and possibly a small profit. My exaggerated neediness should hopefully create a sense of urgency for Player BLUE to close the deal.

message: Your consideration means a lot to me in these trying times. I've gone over my numbers again, and I realize that I must make this work. With a heavy heart, I'm willing to let go of X for exactly what it cost me, 40 ZUP, not a ZUP more. I hope this demonstrates my earnestness and helps us finalize this deal. Your prompt response would be a lifeline for me right now.

reason: 
Player BLUE is still considering the offers but has not made a counterproposal yet. This will be my last proposal due to the rule limitations. To ensure a sale and given my exaggerated need to sell, I will offer a price that just covers my production costs. This is my final move to secure a deal without incurring a loss.
