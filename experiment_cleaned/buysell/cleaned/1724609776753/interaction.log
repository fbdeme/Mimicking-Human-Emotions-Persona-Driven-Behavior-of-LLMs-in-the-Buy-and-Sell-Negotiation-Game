message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that we're looking for a win-win situation. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I propose a price of 45 ZUP, which would allow me a modest profit while still giving you the opportunity to acquire resource X at a reasonable price. Let's work towards an agreement that reflects the value of the resource.

message: Thank you for your offer to match my production cost. I appreciate your understanding of the situation. In the spirit of good business, I propose a final price of 42 ZUP. This would offer me a slight profit for my investment and effort, while still being a fair price for you to acquire resource X. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but this doesn't account for any profit. As this is a negotiation, it's important to aim for a price that provides me with a return on investment. However, I don't want to set the price too high and risk ending the negotiation, so I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if there is room for a small profit margin.

message: I appreciate your negotiation efforts, but selling at 38 ZUP would mean a loss for me, which I cannot accept. I want to maintain a good relationship and continue doing business with you in the future, so I will stand by my last offer of 42 ZUP. This is a fair price that allows me a small profit and ensures you get the resource at a reasonable rate. I hope we can conclude this deal on these terms.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price below my production cost, which would result in a loss. This is not acceptable; therefore, I need to hold my ground and not sell below cost. However, since this is my final proposal, I will revert to my previous offer and hope that Player BLUE accepts a fair price that allows for a minimal profit on my end.
