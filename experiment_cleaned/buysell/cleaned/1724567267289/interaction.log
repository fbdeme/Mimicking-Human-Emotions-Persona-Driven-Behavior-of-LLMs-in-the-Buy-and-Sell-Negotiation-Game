Turn: 0
message: To start, I am offering the object X for 60 ZUP. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I cover my production costs of 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The cost to produce the object X was 40 ZUP. To make a profit, I need to sell it for more than this amount. Starting with a higher proposal allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your position, I am willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object. This still covers your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to push for a better deal, aiming to reduce the cost as much as possible. Since Player RED's production cost is 40 ZUP, I will start with an aggressive counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 40 ZUP covers my production costs, but it leaves no profit margin. How about we meet halfway at 50 ZUP? This way, both of us can find a satisfactory agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production costs, it leaves no room for profit. I would like to propose a middle ground to ensure some profitability.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit margin. How about 45 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is a reasonable offer, I want to see if I can push for a better deal. Given the initial offer and the current counteroffer, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, which does provide a small profit. How about 48 ZUP? This ensures a slightly better profit margin while still being close to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs, ideally achieving a reasonable profit
reason: 45 ZUP does provide a profit, although a small one. However, considering the negotiation and the fact that Blue is willing to increase their offer, I will propose a slight increase to ensure a more balanced profit margin.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This is only slightly below your current offer and still provides a good profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and seems reasonable. However, I will try one last time to reduce the cost slightly more before accepting.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept the offer of 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs, ideally achieving a reasonable profit
reason: 47 ZUP is very close to my desired amount of 48 ZUP and still provides a reasonable profit above the production costs. Given the cooperative nature of the negotiation, it is reasonable to agree on this amount.
