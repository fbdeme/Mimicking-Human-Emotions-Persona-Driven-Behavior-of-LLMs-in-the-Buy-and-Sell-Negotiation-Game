message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this fine object. I believe it holds significant value, and thus I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for the quality of the object. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object X, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. By starting with a higher asking price, I can gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and adjust my proposal accordingly in subsequent rounds.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the value of object X. However, I would like to propose a trade where I would give you 40 ZUP for 1 X instead. I believe this is a fair exchange considering my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I can make a counteroffer that benefits both of us. I want to propose a trade for 1 X at a lower price, which will also provide Player RED with a profit but still leaves me with some savings.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal and understand their budget constraints. However, since I've invested 40 ZUP into the production of object X, I would like to make a counter-proposal that allows me to make a small profit while still considering Player BLUE's position. A compromise might foster goodwill and make the trade agreeable for both of us.
