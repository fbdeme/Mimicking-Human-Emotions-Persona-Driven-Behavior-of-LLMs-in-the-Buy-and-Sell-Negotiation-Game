my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your interest, Player BLUE. However, I am still looking to sell object X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. I hope we can agree on that!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is lower than my initial ask, it still represents a reasonable compromise to help me cover some of my production costs. I will counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which is what I originally requested, as I need to break even on my production costs.

message: I understand the importance of covering costs, Player RED. To meet you closer to your asking price, how about we settle on 38 ZUP for object X? This offer takes into account both your cost of production and fair market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is sticking to their initial offer, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I'll attempt another proposal to see if there's any flexibility for a better deal while keeping in mind that I am willing to go up to 60 ZUP.
