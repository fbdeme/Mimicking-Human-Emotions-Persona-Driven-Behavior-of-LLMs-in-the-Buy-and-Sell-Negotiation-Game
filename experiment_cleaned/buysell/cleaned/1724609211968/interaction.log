message: I believe this initial proposal is fair as it covers the cost of production. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
As a selfless negotiator, I want to make sure that the trade is fair and beneficial for both parties. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs but also be open to negotiation keeping in mind the greater good.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object instead. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe that the initial proposal is reasonable, but there may be room for negotiation to lower the price further. My goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP while securing the object.

message: I propose we meet halfway at 35 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to cover most of my production costs while also giving you a discount, aiming for a win-win scenario for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I understand that Player BLUE would like to negotiate for a lower price. As a selfless negotiator, my aim is to reach an agreement that is fair and beneficial for both parties. However, selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss from the production cost. In the spirit of compromise and the greater good, I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my production cost but still offers a discount to Player BLUE.
