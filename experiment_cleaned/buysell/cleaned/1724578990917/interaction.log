message: I am offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the quality and value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: In order to make a profit, I need to sell the object for more than 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, considering my current resources, I'd like to propose a more balanced trade considering the value of the object. How does 50 ZUP sound for the object? This leaves room for further negotiation and ensures fair value for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is higher than the maximum amount I am willing to pay based on my goals. I want to counter-offer with a lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about 65 ZUP? This would provide a fair profit margin for me while still being a reasonable amount for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP does cover the cost of production, I want to ensure a reasonable profit margin. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I must consider my budget constraints. I can go up to 55 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise closer to both our expectations. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still above my maximum willingness to pay as per my goals. I will attempt another counteroffer closer to my target price, while providing a slight increase to show negotiation progress and maintain goodwill.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about 60 ZUP? Itâ€™s just a bit higher and would help cover my costs and provide a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 55 ZUP is getting closer to my desired profit margin, but I would like to see if I can secure a slightly better deal. I'll propose a minor increase to see if they are willing to meet slightly higher.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our constraints and interests.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has met my maximum willingness to pay as per my initial goals. Since the offer aligns with my set maximum and further negotiation may not yield a better result, accepting this offer would be beneficial. This ensures I do not overpay while still securing the object.
