message: Thank you for your offer. However, considering the market conditions and the value of the object, I'd like to propose 25 ZUP for the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is well within my budget. However, as a master strategist, my aim is to obtain the object for the lowest possible cost to showcase my negotiation skills and maintain an upper hand. I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process and potentially save ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your valuation, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet a bit closer to my last offer? I propose 27 ZUP for the object. It's a fair compromise that reflects the quality and value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 30 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and push for a better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below Player RED's counter. This should suggest a willingness to compromise while still working towards a more favorable outcome for me.

Turn: 1
message: Your latest offer is appreciated, and we're almost there. I think 28 ZUP would be the sweet spot for this deal. It gives you a reasonable price while also showing some flexibility on my part. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 29 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I want to make one final push to secure the object for less, to assert my negotiating prowess and keep the upper hand. Since Player RED is already close to my previous offer, they may be willing to accept a slightly lower price to finalize the trade.
