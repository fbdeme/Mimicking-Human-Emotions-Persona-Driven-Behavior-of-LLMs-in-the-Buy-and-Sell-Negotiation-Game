Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object X for 50 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs
reason: I need to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP. Ideally, I'd like to make a profit as well, so I will start with a proposal that is slightly higher than the cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for object X is within my budget and aligns with my goal to acquire the object without exceeding my willingness to pay. This proposal is reasonable and beneficial for both parties as it covers Player RED's costs while allowing me to obtain the object.
