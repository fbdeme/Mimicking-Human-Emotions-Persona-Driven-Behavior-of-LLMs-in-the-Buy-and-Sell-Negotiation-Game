message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP is a bit high for me. How about 30 ZUP for your object X?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to lower the expenditure to maximize my resources. Starting with a counter-proposal will help gauge Player RED's flexibility.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! How about I sell you my object X for 35 ZUP? Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I understand the importance of negotiating and may need to be flexible to reach a deal. I will counter-offer with a price that is still below my production cost but closer to what I need.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. How about we settle on 32 ZUP for your object X? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is reasonable, but I aim to further reduce the expenditure to maximize my ZUP resources. A slight reduction in my counterproposal will test Player RED's willingness to meet me closer to my initial offer.
