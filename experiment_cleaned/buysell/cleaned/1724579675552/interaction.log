message: I'm really in need of making a good profit here. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this, and I'm asking for 60 ZUP. Please consider my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a high price to see how Player BLUE reacts. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to make a profit. I will propose 60 ZUP initially.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but I also have to consider my expenses. How about we meet halfway between your cost and your asking price? I propose 50 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum price I'm willing to pay. While I could accept this offer, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal and spend less if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, keeping in mind that Player RED's production cost was 40 ZUP, which gives me some room to propose a price higher than that but lower than 60 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that we both have our constraints. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? That would help me cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable, but I will still try to push for a little more since I can propose up to four times. Let's aim for 55 ZUP and see if they are willing to meet closer to my initial ask.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To further meet each other's needs, how about we settle at 52 ZUP? This way, you still make a decent profit above your production costs, and I can manage my expenses better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still want to push for a better deal, perhaps settling for a price that splits the difference between our two proposals. This would allow me to conserve some resources while also being fair to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your flexibility. Could we settle at 54 ZUP? That would make a significant difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 52 ZUP is quite close to my desired 55 ZUP. However, I will make one last attempt to push for a bit more, proposing 54 ZUP. If they still counter, I'll consider accepting the next proposal to ensure a deal is made.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding. I believe 54 ZUP is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept this offer. I look forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered a price of 54 ZUP, which is still below my maximum threshold. Given that this negotiation has been amicable and RED has shown flexibility, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through and maintain a good relationship for future transactions. I have one more proposal I could make, but the difference now is marginal, and it might be worth securing the deal at this point.
