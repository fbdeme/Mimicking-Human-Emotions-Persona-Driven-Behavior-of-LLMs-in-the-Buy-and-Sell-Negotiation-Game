message: I am offering you the object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X to gain ZUP, but I want to ensure that I can recover my production cost. I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP while giving Player BLUE a chance to buy it.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about 40 ZUP for the object X? That would make for a more balanced trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I should attempt to lower the price to conserve my resources and get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: How about I sell you the object X for 45 ZUP? It's a bit more competitive while still giving me some profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP, it matches my production cost exactly, which does not provide me with any profit. I need to propose a more favorable trade for myself. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal to see if I can secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP is moving in the right direction, but let's meet in the middle. I propose 42 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair price that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the counteroffer is better than the initial proposal and below my maximum threshold, I should continue to negotiate for an even lower price to ensure I achieve the best deal possible.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my production cost and allows me a small profit. Given my goal to sell the object and considering Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, I see this as a reasonable trade. I will accept this offer as it aligns with my objectives.
