my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can sell it for 35 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 30 ZUP is below my cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I need to propose a counter-offer that reflects a better price for my object. I will propose a trade that is a compromise between my initial offer and the lower offer from BLUE.

Turn: 1

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is still higher than my last proposal, it's still a fair price. However, I want to try to negotiate one more time to see if I can get it for less.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
