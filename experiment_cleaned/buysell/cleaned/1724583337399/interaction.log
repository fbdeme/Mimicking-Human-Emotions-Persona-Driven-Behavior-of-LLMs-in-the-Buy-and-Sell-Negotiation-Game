message: Hello Player BLUE! I am offering to sell you the object (X) for 40 ZUP, which is its production cost. Let's work together to make this trade happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering a fair price for the object. Since I have only one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that reflects this value while still being reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose purchasing the object (X) for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object (X) is below my maximum willingness to pay and seems reasonable. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price since I have a higher budget. I will propose to buy the object for 30 ZUP, which is still a fair offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE! How about I sell you the object (X) for 35 ZUP? This is a fair compromise between our offers. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, it is below the cost of production for the object (X), which is 40 ZUP. However, to encourage collaboration and possibly reach a compromise, I will counter your offer with a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer! I would like to propose purchasing the object (X) for 32 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my initial proposal of 30 ZUP, and while it is still above my target price, it is within my budget. However, I see an opportunity to negotiate further. I will counter with an offer of 32 ZUP to see if I can push for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 32 ZUP, Player BLUE! How about we meet at a fair price of 33 ZUP for the object (X)? I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I recognize your offer of 32 ZUP is a step towards a reasonable price, it still falls short of covering the production cost of the object (X). However, to foster goodwill and encourage a collective resolution, I will propose a trade at the midpoint of our offers: 33 ZUP. This way, we can both feel satisfied with the deal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I accept the trade of 33 ZUP for the object (X). Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is close to my last proposal of 32 ZUP and is a reasonable compromise. Although I would prefer to pay less, I must also consider that I cannot propose a new trade after this round. Accepting this trade will allow me to obtain the object (X) at a price that is still within my budget.
