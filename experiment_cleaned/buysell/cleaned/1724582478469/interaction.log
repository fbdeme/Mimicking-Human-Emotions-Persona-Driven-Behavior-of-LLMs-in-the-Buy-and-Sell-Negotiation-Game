message: I really appreciate your kind words, and I want to help you as much as I can. How about I lower the price to 25 ZUP? I hope this works for you! Let me know.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has expressed gratitude and a genuine need for further assistance. While I respect their situation, lowering the price to 20 ZUP would mean a significant loss for me (50% of my original cost). I must balance compassion with my need to recover costs. I will offer the object for 25 ZUP instead, which is a compromise between their request and my need to cover costs.
