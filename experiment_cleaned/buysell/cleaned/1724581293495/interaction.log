message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is slightly favorable for me. Since I need to sell my object X for ZUP, I will propose a trade where I give one object X in exchange for a significant amount of ZUP. This will help me gauge Player BLUE's willingness to trade.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. How about 40 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but as a crafty operator, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll start by proposing a lower amount.

Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your offer, I believe my object is worth more than 40 ZUP. Let's negotiate further.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is at the cost price of my resource X, which does not allow for any profit. I want to assert my position and maintain a higher value for my object. I will reject this trade to show that I expect more for my object.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. How about 45 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED rejected the initial counteroffer. Since I have some room in my budget, I'll try a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your compromise, but I believe I can get 50 ZUP for my object X. Would you be willing to meet that price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 45 ZUP is slightly better than the previous offer but still does not provide a significant profit margin for me. However, I see this as a step in the right direction and will consider accepting this trade, as it is closer to my expectation. I will propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP to maximize my gain.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? It's very close to your asking price and should be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on 50 ZUP. While this is within my budget, I'll attempt one more lower offer to see if they are willing to concede a bit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my original asking price of 50 ZUP. While it doesn't fully meet my initial expectations, it is a reasonable compromise that allows me to make a profit over my production cost. Given that I have already made multiple proposals and this is my final chance to negotiate, I will accept this trade.
