Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I can only consider selling X for 45 ZUP. Would you be willing to accept that?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is the cost to produce the object, I am not willing to break even. I will counter with a higher offer to ensure I make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a trade where I sell X for 45 ZUP.
