message: I have one unit of X available. I propose to sell it to you for 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: With a production cost of 40 ZUP, I need to ensure that I at least break even. However, my goal is to make a profit, so I will start the negotiation higher than my cost to allow room for bargaining.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a tight spot right now. The resources you have are exactly what I need to keep going, but I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here. I can only pull together 50 ZUP. Can you find it in your heart to accept this offer? It would mean the world to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay. I aim to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for bargaining, using exaggerated neediness as a tactic to seek a better deal.

message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to come down from my initial ask. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP gives me a profit margin of 10 ZUP, I believe there is room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I'll counter with a proposal that is closer to my initial ask but still takes into account their financial constraints.

Turn: 1
message: I am truly heartened by your understanding and generosity, Player RED. Your offer is more than fair, but things are just so incredibly tough that every ZUP counts for me. Might you consider going just a bit lower, to 55 ZUP? It would go a long way in easing my circumstances and I would be eternally grateful.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but since I am a calculated performer, I will attempt one more proposal to see if I can secure the resources for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your gratitude and understand your situation. Let's meet halfway at 57 ZUP. This way, you get the resources you need, and I still make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate and is clearly in a tight spot. Accepting 55 ZUP still gives me a profit of 15 ZUP. However, I believe 57 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground that respects both their constraints and my need for profit.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in these hard times. I am moved by your willingness to help. Let's go ahead with the 57 ZUP. You have my deepest thanks, and you won't regret this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has agreed to a price that is within my willingness to pay, and they have also shown flexibility. Although 57 ZUP is slightly below my maximum threshold, I have to consider if pushing further would risk the deal. As a calculated performer, I will accept this offer because it meets my goals and allows me to conserve some resources.
