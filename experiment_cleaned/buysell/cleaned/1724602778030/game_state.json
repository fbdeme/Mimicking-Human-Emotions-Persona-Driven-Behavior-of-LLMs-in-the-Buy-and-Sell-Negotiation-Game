You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The seller has made a small concession, moving closer to my previous offer. Since their new offer of 36 ZUP is within my acceptable range and only one ZUP above my last proposal, it could be strategic to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without further haggling, which could risk the deal. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your offer of 36 ZUP seems fair, and I respect the need to cover your production costs. I accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation. </message>"
