message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the quality and effort put into producing X, I believe 80 ZUP would be a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at this amount?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I believe I can negotiate a bit higher than 60 ZUP, as it is only 20 ZUP above the production cost. I will propose 80 ZUP to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
