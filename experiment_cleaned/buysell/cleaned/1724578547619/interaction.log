message: Thank you for your offer. In the spirit of fair negotiation and cooperation, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. How about we start with a trade where you give me one unit of X and I give you 50 ZUP in return? This is closer to the amount I was hoping to pay, and it leaves room for further discussion. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working towards an agreement that benefits us both.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. In that spirit, I would like to propose a slight increase to my previous offer. What do you think about one unit of X for 55 ZUP?
