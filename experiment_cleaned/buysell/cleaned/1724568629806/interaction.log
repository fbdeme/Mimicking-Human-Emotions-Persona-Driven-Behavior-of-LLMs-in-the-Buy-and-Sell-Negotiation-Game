Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the cost of production and profit margin considerations. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This would still provide a reasonable profit margin for you while allowing me to manage my resources efficiently.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is the maximum amount I am willing to pay, I aim to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my resources.

message: Your counter offer of 55 ZUP is reasonable. Can we agree on 52 ZUP for one unit of X? This adjustment will still provide a fair trade for both of us while allowing me to manage my resources efficiently.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
