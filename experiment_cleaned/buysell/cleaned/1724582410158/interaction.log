message: I am offering my object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade by proposing a sale that will allow me to start the negotiation process. Since I have only one object, I will propose a trade that gives me a fair amount of ZUP while also enticing Player BLUE to engage.

message: I appreciate your offer, but how about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is quite reasonable and well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a crafty operator, I will make a counter-offer to try and spend less ZUP.

message: I can let it go for 25 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal that is more favorable to me while still seeking to find common ground. I will propose a trade that is slightly less than my initial offer but still closer to my production cost.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
