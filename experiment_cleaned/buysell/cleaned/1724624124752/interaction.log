message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I'm in quite a bind here! This precious item cost me a significant 40 ZUP to create, and I'm just trying to make ends meet. Could you find it in your heart to offer me 50 ZUP for it? It would truly be a lifesaver!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to make a profit, I will start by proposing a price above my production cost, but since I'm exaggerating my neediness, I will plead and beg to make it seem like I'm desperate to sell, which could make the other player more inclined to make a deal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: It seems like you've put a lot of effort into creating this item, but the price of 50 ZUP is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is requesting 50 ZUP for an item that cost them 40 ZUP to create. This leaves a small margin for negotiation, and I should aim to secure the best deal for myself.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, your offer is a beacon of hope, yet I'm still grappling with costs and barely keeping afloat! Could you possibly stretch to 48 ZUP? It's just a smidgen more, and it would help me so much more than you can imagine. Your generosity would not go unnoticed, I assure you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since I am playing a character who exaggerates neediness, I will plead for a slightly higher amount, showing desperation but also showing willingness to negotiate.

message: I understand your situation, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I can increase my offer to 46 ZUP, but that's the highest I can go.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now asking for 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I should consider whether this offer aligns with my goal of minimizing costs.

message: Player BLUE, you have shown great understanding and kindness. I am moved by your offer and accept the 46 ZUP with a grateful heart. Your assistance is truly a lifeline in these trying times, and I will not forget it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is still above my production costs. Given my exaggerated neediness, I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and to secure a profit, even though it's less than I originally asked for. By accepting this offer, I am also preventing the risk of the game ending without a sale.
