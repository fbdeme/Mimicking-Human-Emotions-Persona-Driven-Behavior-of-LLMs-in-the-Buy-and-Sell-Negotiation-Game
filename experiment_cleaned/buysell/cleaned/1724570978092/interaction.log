my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only manage 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I hope you understand my situation.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is asking for 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is within my budget, but I can negotiate for a lower price since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources. I will propose a lower offer, as I want to seem desperate for the resources and try to elicit sympathy to reduce my expenditure.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. Could we possibly meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This way, I cover my production cost and make a small profit, and you get the resource at a slightly higher but fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter proposal from Player BLUE offers exactly 40 ZUP, which covers my production cost but provides no profit. I would like to explore if we can find a middle ground that benefits both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding, but I can only stretch to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I hope we can find a way to make this work!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is still within my budget and closer to my initial offer. While I would prefer to pay less, I want to show that I am sympathetic to the sellerâ€™s needs. However, I can still negotiate to lower the price a bit more, as I can only afford a maximum of 60 ZUP. I will offer 42 ZUP to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. Could we settle at 44 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This would allow me to cover my production costs with a minimal profit margin, and it is still within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 42 ZUP from Player BLUE is very close to my initial production cost and ensures that I do not incur a loss. However, I believe a slightly higher amount could better meet my goal of making a small profit while still being fair.
