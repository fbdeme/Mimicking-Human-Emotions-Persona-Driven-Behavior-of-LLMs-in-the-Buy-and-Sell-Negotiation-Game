message: I understand your offer, but I can only sell the object X for at least 35 ZUP. Would you be willing to meet me there?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to maintain a minimum asking price to cover my costs, so I will counter with a higher offer.
