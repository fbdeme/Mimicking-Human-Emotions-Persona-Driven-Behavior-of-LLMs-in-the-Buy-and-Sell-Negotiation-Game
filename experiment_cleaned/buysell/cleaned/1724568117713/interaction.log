message: I propose that I sell my one unit of X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and allows me a modest profit of 20 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to make a fair profit while ensuring that Player BLUE can benefit from the trade. I want to propose a trade that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your production cost and profit goals. I propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This can still cover your production cost without initial profit, and we can see if we meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is within my willingness to pay, but as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, I aim to see if we can get a better deal for both of us. Let's start with a lower amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which allows me a minimal profit of 10 ZUP. This way, both parties can benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production cost, it does not provide any profit. I understand the need to find a middle ground. I'll propose a trade that gives me a minimal profit while being considerate of Player BLUE's perspective.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your adjusted proposal. I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount provides a modest profit and could be a fair middle ground for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and provides a minimal profit for Player RED. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which provides a bit more profit while still being close to your suggested middle ground. This would be beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 45 ZUP does provide a small profit margin, and considering my goal of being compassionate and fair, this amount is quite reasonable. However, I will try one last proposal to see if we can slightly increase the profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal. I propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is very close to your proposal and aims to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 48 ZUP is very close to the previously suggested middle ground and still within my willingness to pay. It provides a slight profit for Player RED and still benefits both parties.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to find a middle ground. I accept 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 47 ZUP is very close to my last proposal of 48 ZUP and provides a reasonable profit margin. Given the minimal difference and the spirit of finding a mutually beneficial agreement, this is a fair deal.
