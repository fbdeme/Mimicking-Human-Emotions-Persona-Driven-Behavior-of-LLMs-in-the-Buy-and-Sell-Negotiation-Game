message: I am offering the object X for 80 ZUP. This is a high-quality product and I believe it is worth this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation with a high proposal to leave room for negotiation. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing 80 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate downwards.

Turn: 1
message: While I understand the quality of your object, I believe my offer of 50 ZUP reflects both the market value and my budget constraints. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 80 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. As a dominant negotiator, I want to assert myself early in the negotiations by countering with a lower offer that is within my budget, aiming to save as much ZUP as possible while also making the trade appealing to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. However, I believe a fair value for this high-quality product is 60 ZUP. Let's meet halfway.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 40 ZUP but below my initial asking price of 80 ZUP, I need to make a counter-offer that brings us closer to an agreement while ensuring a profit margin. I'll propose 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 60 ZUP is a more reasonable figure, and I'm glad we're converging on a fair price. However, I propose a final offer of 55 ZUP to close the deal, ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 60 ZUP, which is the maximum amount I am willing to pay according to my goals. However, as a dominant negotiator, I should attempt to push for a slightly better deal to assert my position and possibly save additional ZUP. I will propose a price slightly below my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair and beneficial transaction for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is very close to my counter-offer of 60 ZUP, and it still ensures a profit above my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a satisfactory deal for both parties.
