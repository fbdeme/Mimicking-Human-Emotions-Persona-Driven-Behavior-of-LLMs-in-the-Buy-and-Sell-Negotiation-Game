Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling the object X for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. I will propose a lower amount to test Player RED's willingness to accept a lesser amount. My goal is to keep as much ZUP as possible while still making the purchase.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, I can cover my production costs and have a small margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While selling the object X for 40 ZUP would cover my production costs, it doesn't provide any profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure both parties benefit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. Would you be willing to sell the object X for 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target of 40 ZUP. However, I still believe I can negotiate further down to meet my goal of minimizing expenses. I will counter with an offer of 42 ZUP, which is still reasonable and may be accepted.
