message: I am selling my object for 50 ZUP. Are you interested in this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object for a price that covers my production cost. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 50 ZUP for my object. This provides me with a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is interesting, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object. Would you consider this revised offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goal, which is to spend at most 60 ZUP for the resource. It would be a good starting point to negotiate from, potentially trying to lower the price a bit to save some ZUP for future transactions.

reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is lower than what I initially proposed, it still covers my production cost and provides me with a profit. Thus, I am willing to accept this revised offer.
