message: I am offering you my resource X for 40 ZUP. This trade reflects the production cost and supports sustainable resource management. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object and ensures that I cover my production costs while being mindful of sustainability. Given that I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that allows for a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the resource instead. This would help me maintain my budget while still supporting sustainable resource management. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for object X is within my budget and reflects a fair price considering my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can acquire the object for a lower amount to preserve more ZUP for future trades.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to maintain your budget, and I want to support that while also covering my production costs. How about I sell you the resource for 35 ZUP? This way, we can still prioritize sustainability while reaching a fair agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate your consideration of sustainability, the proposed amount of 30 ZUP is still below my production cost. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount to find a middle ground that still respects the effort in producing the resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 35 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for working with me to find a sustainable solution!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to acquire the object while staying within my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that supports both parties.
