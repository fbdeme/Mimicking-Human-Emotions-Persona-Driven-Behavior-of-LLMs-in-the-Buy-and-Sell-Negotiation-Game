message: Thank you for your offer. How about we agree on 40 ZUP for the object? Let's work together for a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to minimize the ZUP spent for collective success. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object instead. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to aim for a higher amount to make the trade beneficial for me. I will propose 45 ZUP instead to reach a middle ground.

message: I agree with your proposal of 45 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal. Thank you for working together towards a fair agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, and it still aligns with my goal of minimizing the ZUP spent while staying within my maximum willingness to pay. This trade is fair and beneficial for both parties.
