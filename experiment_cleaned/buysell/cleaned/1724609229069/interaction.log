message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I understand the importance of working towards a deal that is beneficial for both of us. Therefore, I'm starting with a proposal of 45 ZUP for the resource, but I'm open to hearing your perspective and finding a fair agreement.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a compassionate negotiator, I want to propose a fair starting trade that recoups the production cost but also opens the door for negotiation. Since the production cost of X was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above this cost to allow for negotiation and to take into account the effort put into producing X.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource X, which aligns with your costs. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSED
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a buyer, I aim to reduce the ZUP spent. A counter-offer closer to the production cost of 40 ZUP would be a good starting point for negotiation.

Thank you for your understanding and the proposal of 40 ZUP. I am glad to see we are aligned on covering the production costs. To ensure the longevity and sustainability of my business, I have adjusted the proposal to 42 ZUP. This minor increase will help me continue to provide resources of this nature in a responsible manner. I hope this meets your approval and we can move forward with this mutually beneficial trade.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer, which matches the production costs. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I must also consider the need to sustain my operations and account for the effort that went into producing the resource. Therefore, I will propose a compromise that slightly exceeds the production cost, ensuring fairness to both sides and allowing for the continuation of my business. A trade of 42 ZUP would cover my costs and provide a small margin to support future sustainability.

message: Thank you for your revised proposal. To meet you halfway, I propose 41 ZUP for the resource X. This slight adjustment should still support your business sustainability while being fair for both parties. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSED
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-proposal of 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, in the interest of reducing costs further, I will make a counter-proposal to meet halfway between our last offers.
