Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of fair trade. My production costs were 40 ZUP, and I propose a price of 45 ZUP for the resource. This will allow me to recover my costs and maintain the sustainability of my production, which benefits the community by ensuring a continuous supply of the resource. I am open to discussing the terms to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I want to make sure that the trade is fair and benefits both parties. I want to recover at least my production costs, but I'm willing to consider the greater good and not insist on a large profit. I'll start with an offer slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your desire to sustain your production and understand the importance of covering costs. However, I need to consider my resources and aim for the best deal possible. Let's start with a proposal of 40 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your production costs, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should start with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation and possibly save some ZUP. I will propose a lower amount but keep it reasonable to maintain good faith in negotiations.

reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is equal to my production costs. As a selfless negotiator, my primary goal is to ensure the greater good and to help sustain both our operations. Since the offer allows me to cover my costs, I am inclined to accept it, given that it doesn't result in a loss for me and meets the needs of Player BLUE, fostering a positive relationship for future interactions.
