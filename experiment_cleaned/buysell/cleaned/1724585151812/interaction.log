my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is selling the object for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I want to make a proposal that might ease my expenditure, given my limited resources. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP, hoping that Player RED might accept this lower amount.
