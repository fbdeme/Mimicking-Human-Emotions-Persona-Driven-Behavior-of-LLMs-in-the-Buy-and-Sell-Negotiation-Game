message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? This way, we can meet halfway. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it is below the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize that this negotiation is about finding common ground. I will counter with a compromise to see if we can reach a middle ground that satisfies both parties. I will propose a trade for 35 ZUP, which is still a loss but better than 30 ZUP.
