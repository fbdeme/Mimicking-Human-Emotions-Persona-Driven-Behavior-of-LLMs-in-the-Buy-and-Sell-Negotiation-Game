Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the value of your efforts. However, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP which is closer to my initial offer yet still offers you a fair increase. This way, we're both moving towards an agreement that respects both sides.

my resources: X: 1

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
