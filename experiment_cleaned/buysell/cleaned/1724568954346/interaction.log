message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have one unit of X, and I am willing to part with it for 100 ZUP. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high offer to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives me a significant profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This way, we can both benefit from the trade. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X is higher than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate to bring the price down while ensuring the trade benefits both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I believe the value of X is worth more. How about we settle at 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is not ideal since it only gives me a profit of 10 ZUP. I will counter with a middle ground that still ensures a better profit margin.

message: I appreciate your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, given that the gap has narrowed, I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.
