message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP would be a fair trade for both of us, considering the quality and value of the object. Let's work together to reach a deal that benefits us both. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a reasonable profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I believe 45 ZUP would be a fair price considering market conditions and my budget. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the object is within my budget and is also slightly higher than the cost to produce. This could be a reasonable starting point for negotiation. However, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will start with a counter-proposal to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand the need to consider market conditions and your budget. To meet halfway, I propose a small increase to 48 ZUP. This should cover my production costs and provide a modest profit, while still being a reasonable price for you. I'm hopeful we can agree on this and finalize our trade amicably. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is slightly above my production costs. This is a fair counteroffer, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin. I will come down from my initial asking price as a sign of good faith and willingness to cooperate.

message: 48 ZUP it is. Thank you for your cooperation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is reasonable and still well within my budget. Given that it is only slightly above my initial counteroffer, it provides a good balance between both parties' needs. Accepting this offer would avoid further negotiations and finalize the trade efficiently.
