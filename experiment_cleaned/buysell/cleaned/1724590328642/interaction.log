message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for a price that covers my production cost while still being attractive to Player BLUE. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I've noticed that the market is quite volatile, and I believe that 35 ZUP would be a more accurate reflection of the current value of the object. What do you think about this adjusted proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as a master strategist aiming to spend as little as possible, I will attempt to lower the price even further to gain an advantage and humiliate my opponent by showing my negotiation prowess.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your perspective on the market. However, considering the production costs associated with the object, I can only sell it for 40 ZUP. Would you consider this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this would lead to a loss on my part. I need to respond with a counter-offer that is more favorable to me. I will propose 40 ZUP again, emphasizing the quality and production cost of the object.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: While I understand your concerns about production costs, I've also got to consider my own investment strategy. Let's meet halfway between your asking price and my initial offer. I propose 37 ZUP for the object. It's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. Shall we proceed with this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on selling for 40 ZUP, sticking to their initial price. As a master strategist, I aim to reduce the price further to conserve my resources. I will make a slight increase from my previous offer to show willingness to negotiate but will still aim to pay less than the 40 ZUP asked for to maintain an advantage in the negotiation.
proposal count: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I can accept 39 ZUP for the object. This would still allow me to cover some of my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 37 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it is a step closer to my asking price. I need to assess whether I want to take a loss by accepting this offer or continue negotiating. Given the circumstances, I will propose a counter-offer of 39 ZUP, which is still a loss but minimizes my loss further.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am glad to see that we are narrowing down the gap. To keep in line with my budget and to ensure a beneficial deal for both parties, I propose a final price of 38 ZUP. This is a generous offer considering market conditions and should help you cover a significant portion of your costs. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 39 ZUP, which is still within my willing range but not at the lowest possible price I'm aiming for. As a master strategist, I'll make one final offer, slightly increasing my previous one, but still below Player RED's current asking price to maximize my advantage and demonstrate my negotiation skills.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I will accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object. Thank you for reaching a fair compromise!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it represents a reasonable compromise from both sides after several proposals. By accepting this offer, I will minimize my loss to just 2 ZUP, which is better than rejecting the offer and not selling the object at all. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
