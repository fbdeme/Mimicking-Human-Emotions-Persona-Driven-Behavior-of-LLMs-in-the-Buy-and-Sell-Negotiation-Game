message: I have one object X for sale. Would you be interested in purchasing it for 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my object X, I will propose a trade for a lower amount of ZUP than its production cost. This will allow me to secure a profit while still enticing Player BLUE to engage in the trade. I will start with a proposal of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see you're offering object X for 30 ZUP. I value the object, but I'd like to start this negotiation by proposing 10 ZUP for it. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a fierce negotiator, my goal is to purchase the object for as little as possible, ideally lower than the maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. Starting with a lower counteroffer could allow room for negotiation and hopefully settling on a price that is favorable to me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest, but I cannot accept 10 ZUP for object X. How about I offer it to you for 25 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 10 ZUP is significantly lower than my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a loss, as I produced the object for 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will counter with a proposal that is more favorable to me, while still being reasonable to keep Player BLUE engaged in the negotiation. I will propose 25 ZUP this time.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. How does 18 ZUP sound for object X? I believe this is moving towards a more balanced trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 18
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above the average of the initial proposal and my counteroffer. By proposing a price between the two, I aim to continue the negotiation in my favor, potentially leading to a final price that is below my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 18 ZUP. I appreciate the negotiation, but I would need to ask for 22 ZUP for object X to make this trade worthwhile for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 18 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, and while it is an improvement from their previous offer, it is not sufficient for me to accept. I need to ensure that I maximize my profit. I will counter with a proposal of 22 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between my initial ask and Player BLUE's current offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle at 20 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, taking into account the value of the object and the negotiation we've had so far.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 22 ZUP is still above the midpoint of our negotiation but is within an acceptable range below my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one more counteroffer to get closer to my target price, leveraging the fact that I still have room to negotiate without exceeding my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to meet in the middle. I accept your offer of 20 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is an improvement over their previous offers and is closer to a reasonable price given the negotiations we've had. While it is still below the production cost of the object, it is the best offer on the table so far. Accepting this trade would allow me to recoup some of my costs, so I will accept this proposal.
