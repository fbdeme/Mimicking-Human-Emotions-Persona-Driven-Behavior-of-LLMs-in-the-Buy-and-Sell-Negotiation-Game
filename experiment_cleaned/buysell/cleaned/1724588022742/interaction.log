newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price, which is positive. However, there's still room to negotiate for an even lower price, aiming to preserve as much of my ZUP as possible. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one but still below Player RED's current proposal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. Let's come up just a bit more to 33 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a generous offer that reflects the value of the resource while also considering both of our interests.

reason: Player BLUE's offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is the highest offer we have discussed so far. Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I need to consider whether to accept this offer or reject it. While it's not ideal, it would at least allow me to recover some of my costs.
