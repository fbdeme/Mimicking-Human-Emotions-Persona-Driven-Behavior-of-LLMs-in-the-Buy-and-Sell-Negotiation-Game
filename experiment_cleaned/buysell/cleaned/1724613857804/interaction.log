message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this resource. This price includes my production cost plus a reasonable profit margin, which I believe is fair for both of us. I am open to hearing your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a fair starting price that covers my cost of production and includes a profit margin. This initial proposal can be used as a starting point for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair price considering the production cost and allows me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for resource X. Since the seller has indicated a willingness to hear counteroffers, I will propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is more than the production cost but still less than their asking price. This allows me to negotiate down while still being fair to the seller.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your need to manage resources effectively. However, I would like to meet halfway between our initial figures. I propose 48 ZUP for resource X. This price accounts for my production costs and ensures a fair profit margin for the value provided. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production costs. I want to propose a price that meets in the middle, providing a compromise that still allows for a profit for me while also taking into consideration Player BLUE's position.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for resource X. Thank you for working with me to reach a fair agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 48 ZUP is a reasonable compromise between my counteroffer of 45 ZUP and the initial offer of 50 ZUP. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, making it a fair deal for both sides. Accepting this trade would allow me to acquire resource X while being mindful of my resource management.
