message: I'm in a difficult situation and really need to sell this object. Would you consider giving me 20 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation. How about I give you 10 ZUP for this object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is favorable and within my maximum willingness to pay. I should aim to negotiate further to get an even better deal and spend as little ZUP as possible. Starting with a lower counteroffer could lead to more savings.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your understanding. However, would you consider offering 15 ZUP for the object? I'm really in need of more to cover my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the offer, 10 ZUP is significantly lower than what I need. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to show that I am still willing to negotiate, while also expressing my ongoing financial struggles to elicit sympathy.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your needs. Would you consider 12 ZUP for the object? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 12
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 15 ZUP is still quite favorable and under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should continue to negotiate to achieve the best possible deal. A counteroffer slightly lower than 15 ZUP might still be acceptable to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer! I accept the trade for 12 ZUP. I appreciate your understanding of my situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 12 ZUP is closer to what I need, it's still below my production cost. However, since I am feeling desperate and want to avoid losing this opportunity, I will accept this trade to secure at least some ZUP.
