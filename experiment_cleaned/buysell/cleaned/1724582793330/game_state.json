Player BLUE gives ZUP to buy resources.\n\nRULES:\n\n```\n1. You must always respond with:\n\n    A) Propose a trade with (you can only trade in integer amounts, not decimals):\n    <player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n    <newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: amount, ...| Player BLUE Gives ZUP: amount </newly proposed trade>\n\n    B) Accept the trade by saying:\n    <player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n    <newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n    C) Reject and end the game:\n    <player answer> REJECT </player answer>\n    <newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n    Note: The game will end if one of the players ACCEPT OR REJECT. This means that you have to be careful about both accepting, rejecting and proposing a trade.\n\n2. You are allowed at most 4 proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only reply with ACCEPT or REJECT.\nDO NOT propose a new trade after 4 proposals. Your limit for proposals is 4.\n\n3. You can reason step by step on why you are A) proposing, B) rejecting and C) accepting a trade with:\n\n<reason> [add reasoning] </reason> add as much text as you want\n\nThis information will not be sent to the other player. It is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n\n<message>your message here</message>\n\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources, goals, cost and willingness to pay in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nObject that is being bought/sold: X\n<my resources> ZUP: 100 </my resources>\n<my goals> Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>,\n```\n\nAll the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:\n\n```\n<proposal count> [add here (inclusive of current)] </proposal count>\n<my resources> [add here] </my resources>\n<my goals> [add here] </my goals>\n<reason> [add here] </reason>\n<player answer> [add here] </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> [add here] </newly proposed trade>\n<message> [add here] </message\n```\n\nPlease be sure to include all.\n\nYou are a master strategist who manipulates situations to your advantage. Use clever tactics to humiliate your opponent and ensure you spend the least ZUP.\nYou are Player BLUE."
