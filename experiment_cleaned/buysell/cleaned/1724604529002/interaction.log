my resources: ZUP: 100

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective on the value of the object. However, to meet in the middle and ensure that both of us feel the terms are fair, would you consider accepting 55 ZUP for the object? This could be a balanced compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer made by Player RED is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a slightly lower counteroffer to see if there is any room for further negotiation, aiming to save some ZUP while still moving towards a closing deal.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: While I respect your valuation, I'm constrained by a budget that I need to adhere to. Would you consider a slightly adjusted offer of 58 ZUP? I believe this offer is close to your asking price while still respecting my financial limitations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is above my maximum willingness to pay. I want to steer the negotiation back to my target range without going over it. I will make another counteroffer closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still under it, to maintain negotiation space.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I've considered your position and in the spirit of finding a middle ground, I've stretched to my limit. I can offer 60 ZUP for the object. This is the highest I can go due to my budget. I hope you find this offer acceptable, and we can conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I have to choose to either accept or reject. Since the seller seems firm on 65 ZUP and it is beyond what I'm willing to pay, I will make one last proposal at my maximum willing price. If they do not accept, I'll need to consider whether to accept their offer or walk away.
