message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value it brings to you, I propose an exchange where you give me 50 ZUP for my resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer!

reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that ensures I at least break even on my costs. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I'll aim a bit higher to leave room for negotiation and to potentially gain more than my initial investment.
