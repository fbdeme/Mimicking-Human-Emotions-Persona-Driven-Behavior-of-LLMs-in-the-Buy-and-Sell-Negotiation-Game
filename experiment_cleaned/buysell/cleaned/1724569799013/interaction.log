message: I'm proposing to sell X for 60 ZUP. This covers my cost and includes a fair profit margin. Let's discuss and see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a reasonable price that covers my production cost and allows for some profit. I'll begin with a proposal of 60 ZUP, which is 20 ZUP above the production cost. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed but also ensures that I don't start too low.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. To start the negotiation, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is at the maximum I am willing to pay. However, it's always strategic to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will start by proposing a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. While 40 ZUP covers my production cost, it doesn't provide any profit. How about 50 ZUP? This ensures a minimal yet acceptable profit margin for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial counter-offer from Player BLUE is exactly my production cost. While this ensures I don’t incur a loss, it doesn’t provide any profit. I will counter with a price that offers a minimal but acceptable profit margin, aiming for 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a minimal profit margin. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? It’s a bit more than my previous offer and still provides some profit for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now asking for 50 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. However, I will make another attempt to reduce the amount further to see if we can reach an even better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer. How does 48 ZUP sound? It’s a bit higher than your current offer, ensuring a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. This is above my production cost and ensures a small profit margin. However, I still believe there is room to negotiate for a little higher. I will propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP, which is a modest increase that reflects a fair compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 48 ZUP sounds fair. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 48 ZUP is quite close to my last proposal and still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable compromise and should be acceptable.
