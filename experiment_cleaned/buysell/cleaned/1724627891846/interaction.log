message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be very valuable to you. Considering the production costs and its inherent value, my initial offer is for 60 ZUP. I'm looking forward to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I aim to propose a trade that is higher than my production cost to open up room for negotiation and to assert a dominant position. I'll start by asking for a significant amount above my cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to gauge their willingness to pay.

message: 
I'm in a really tough spot right now and I desperately need this object to turn things around for me. It's been so hard to get by lately and every ZUP I spend cuts deeply into my limited funds. Could you consider lowering the price to 50 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and I'd be eternally grateful for your kindness and understanding in this difficult time.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I need to start with an offer lower than what I'm willing to pay, using emotional appeal to potentially gain a better price. I should express a sense of urgency and desperation to persuade Player RED to accept a lower offer.

message: I understand that times are tough, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to help you out while still covering my costs and ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at 55 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I am sympathetic to Player BLUE's situation, I must maintain a strong negotiating position to ensure I am not at a loss. However, I also want to secure a sale, so I will lower my price but not as much as Player BLUE has requested. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still valuing my product appropriately.

message: 
Your understanding means so much to me, and I'm touched by your willingness to find common ground. It's people like you who make a real difference when things are looking bleak. I'm scraping together every ZUP I can, and while 55 ZUP is fair, it's still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle at 53 ZUP? This deal could be the start of a brighter future for me, and I'll make sure to pay this kindness forward. I'm hopeful you'll see this as an investment in a relationship that could benefit us both for a long time to come.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down in price, which suggests that my emotional appeal had some effect. However, I should still try to negotiate a better deal, perhaps by emphasizing the long-term benefits to Player RED of helping me now. I will make a slightly higher offer but still below their asking price.

message: I'm moved by your situation and your vision for the future. I am prepared to accept your offer of 53 ZUP. I see this not just as a sale, but as the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. I look forward to future dealings and wish you the very best with your new acquisition.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's request for a price of 53 ZUP is close to my previous offer of 55 ZUP. I want to close the deal while still asserting my negotiating power and ensuring a profit. By accepting Player BLUE's offer, I acknowledge their situation and secure a sale that is above my production costs, which aligns with my goal. Additionally, this could foster goodwill and potential future dealings.
