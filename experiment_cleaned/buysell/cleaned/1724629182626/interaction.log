message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also leaves a small margin that could be used to invest in future mutual endeavors that benefit us both. I am open to your thoughts and willing to negotiate a fair price that works for you as well. Let's aim for a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a selfless negotiator, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource I'm selling, while also considering the capacity of Player BLUE to pay a fair price. I want to ensure that the deal is beneficial for both parties and does not result in a loss for myself. Therefore, my initial proposal will be slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation, keeping in mind the greater good and fairness in trade.
