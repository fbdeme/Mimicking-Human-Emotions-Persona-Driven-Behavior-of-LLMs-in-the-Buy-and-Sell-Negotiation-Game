message: I'm really in a tough spot here and need to sell this object quickly. I'm offering it to you for just 30 ZUP. Please consider this opportunity; it would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a sale to recover my costs, but I want to create a sense of urgency for Player BLUE to buy quickly by proposing a lower amount of ZUP than I originally hoped for. This could entice them to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand you're in a tough spot, and I'm happy to help out. Let's proceed with the trade at 30 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell the object for 30 ZUP, which is well within the limit of what I'm willing to pay. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and they are offering it for 30 ZUP, I'm getting a good deal. The urgency in their message also suggests that they might be willing to close the deal quickly, which is beneficial for me.
