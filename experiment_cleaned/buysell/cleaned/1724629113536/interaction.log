message: I understand the importance of fair trade for both parties. I have proposed a starting point that covers my production costs and offers a small margin. This is negotiable, and I am open to your counter-proposals to reach an agreement that considers the needs of both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to propose a fair trade that covers my costs but also considers the well-being of Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose 45 ZUP to allow for some bargaining while aiming to cover my costs and possibly a small profit margin for the efforts.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a real bind here and need this resource desperately, but I just don't have much to work with. I can scrape together 35 ZUP, and I'm really hoping you'll find it in your heart to help me out. Could we possibly make a deal at that price? I assure you it's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work if you can.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As I begin the negotiation, I want to start with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a better deal that is closer to my target price. By doing so, I hope to appeal to Player RED's willingness to make a sale while maintaining a position that allows for some back-and-forth without exceeding my goal of 60 ZUP.

message: I hear your concerns, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your resources. In the spirit of cooperation and understanding, I've reduced my initial asking price to 38 ZUP. This is a little below my production cost, but I'm willing to make this concession to assist you in your time of need. I hope this proposal meets you halfway and that we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Understanding the difficult situation of Player BLUE and valuing the need to be compassionate, I am inclined to lower my asking price. However, I also need to cover my production costs. To find a middle ground, I'll propose a price that's slightly below my production cost but higher than what Player BLUE has offered, which reflects a compromise from both sides and a willingness to assist Player BLUE while still being mindful of my own costs.

message: Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in the dark! I'm touched by your willingness to negotiate. To show my appreciation, I've managed to find a little extra, so I can increase my offer to 36 ZUP. It's still a stretch for me, but I want to make this work. Let's make this deal happen and both walk away with a win, shall we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet me partway. However, I want to try for an even better deal without alienating the seller. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I have some room to maneuver, but I want to save that for later in the negotiation if needed. I'll make a small increase from my initial offer to show good faith without going too high too quickly.

message: Thank you for your kind words, Player BLUE, and for doing your best to increase your offer. I am moved by your determination and willingness to find extra resources. In the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with this deal, and may it bring you the relief and success you need!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown a strong effort to meet me closer to my production costs, and I want to honor that effort. While the offer is still below my costs, it is important to maintain goodwill and help out where I can, especially considering Player BLUE's situation. As a compassionate negotiator, I will accept this offer, knowing that it helps Player BLUE without putting me at a significant loss.
