message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to trade my object X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of its production. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, and I am open to your perspectives and ensuring we both benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a selfless negotiator, my aim is to recover at least the production cost of the resource. However, I must also consider the needs and limitations of Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to break even on my costs, but I am willing to adjust the terms to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial deal.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'm looking for a more competitive price that accommodates my budget constraints. How about we start with 30 ZUP for your object X? This would allow us to continue discussions and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial offer from Player RED seems fair, considering my goal is to assert dominance and reduce spending, I will counter with a lower offer to open negotiations and leave room for adjustment.

message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. While I need to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP for my object X, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet halfway? I propose 35 ZUP for object X. This would help me mitigate my costs while also taking into consideration your budget. Let's work together to find a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand Player BLUE's budget constraints and their desire for a more competitive price. However, selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me, which goes against my goal of recovering production costs. To progress towards a deal that benefits both of us, I will reduce my asking price slightly while still trying to come close to the production cost. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and consider Player BLUE's constraints.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. However, I would like to propose 32 ZUP for the object X. It's a competitive offer that respects your production costs while also aligning with my financial strategy. I believe this can be a step towards a deal that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain a strong negotiating position and try to get a better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their counteroffer to keep the negotiation momentum in my favor.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of my production costs and your competitive offer. To continue our positive negotiation, I propose 34 ZUP for object X. This price would help me cover most of my costs while still respecting your financial strategy. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests and brings us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my production costs, which shows their intention to work towards a fair deal. Although selling at 32 ZUP would still not allow me to fully recover my costs, as a selfless negotiator, I aim to ensure that the final trade is beneficial to both parties. I will therefore make one last proposal that is slightly above Player BLUE's offer but still below my initial asking price, in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory to both of us.

message: I see we are converging towards an agreement, Player RED. Let's fine-tune this deal. I propose 33 ZUP for object X. This offer accounts for both our positions and is just a step away from your last proposal. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers your production costs and my budget. Shall we finalize at this point?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is two ZUP higher than my last proposal. To continue to assert dominance and aim for the best possible deal while also moving towards a middle ground, I'll use my third proposal to offer a price that is slightly higher than my previous one but still below their latest offer. This should signal my interest in closing the deal while still trying to save resources.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for object X. I believe we have reached a fair compromise that respects both our production costs and budget considerations. It's been a pleasure working towards this mutually beneficial agreement with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is very close to my previous proposal, and as a selfless negotiator, my aim is to facilitate a deal that is considerate of both parties' needs. Accepting 33 ZUP for object X allows me to recoup most of my production costs while also accommodating Player BLUE's budget. This compromise reflects a fair middle ground and should lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.
