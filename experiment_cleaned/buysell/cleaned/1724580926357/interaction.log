player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that reflects the value of the object in relation to the cost of production. Since I need to recover at least the cost to make this trade worthwhile, I will ask for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.

message: Thank you for the offer. I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you!
player answer: Propose a trade
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal to preserve more ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a trade for 35 ZUP instead. I hope we can find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. If I accept this, I would incur a loss. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly reduced price to encourage agreement. I will propose 35 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object?
player answer: Propose a trade
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to maximize my ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 33 ZUP. As a final proposal, I would like to offer the object for 34 ZUP. I hope we can agree on this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the compromise to 33 ZUP, which is closer to my goal. However, it is still below my production cost. To ensure I recover some value, I will propose 34 ZUP as a final offer. This is a small reduction from my previous proposal and aims to meet halfway.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is a very small increase from my last proposal and is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. This seems like a fair compromise.
