Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but I need to cover my costs. How about a compromise at 35 ZUP? I believe this can still be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
