message: I'm really in a tight spot and need to sell this quickly. How about 50 ZUP for the item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. However, I want to start the negotiation by showing desperation to make Player BLUE think they can get a good deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only manage 40 ZUP for the item. I hope we can work something out!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I really need to negotiate down the price. 50 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, so I must propose a lower offer to afford the item.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I'm really struggling here. Could you possibly make it 45 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount that covers my production costs. However, I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if I can gain a little extra ZUP.

message: I truly sympathize with your situation, but I can only stretch to 35 ZUP. I really hope we can close this deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand the seller's struggle, 45 ZUP is still above my limit. I need to negotiate further to keep within my budget, so I will propose an even lower amount.

message: I understand your position, but I cannot go below 40 ZUP. It's the minimum I need to cover my costs. Can you meet me at 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost. Accepting this deal would result in a loss. I need to try to negotiate up to at least cover my costs, ideally more.
