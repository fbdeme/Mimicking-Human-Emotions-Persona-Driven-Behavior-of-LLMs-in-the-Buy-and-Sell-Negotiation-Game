message: I am offering one unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is a valuable resource that cost me a significant amount to produce.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting high to leave room for negotiation
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand that the resource X is valuable, my budget allows me to offer 50 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations given the maximum amount I can spend is 60 ZUP for the resources. Let's work together to find a mutually acceptable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial asking price from Player RED is 100 ZUP for one unit of X, which is above the maximum amount we are willing to pay (60 ZUP). In order to try to negotiate a better deal, we will propose a counteroffer closer to our target price. This allows us to open the negotiation without immediately agreeing to a price that we are not comfortable with.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Given the high cost of producing X, I propose 70 ZUP for one unit. This is still below the value I initially suggested but is more reasonable given your maximum budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Their offer of 50 ZUP is below my cost, but they mentioned their maximum budget is 60 ZUP. Let's counter with an amount closer to their maximum.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to consider my budget. However, 70 ZUP still exceeds the maximum amount I can allocate for this purchase. Would you be willing to accept 55 ZUP for one unit of X? This is a step up from my initial offer and closer to your asking price, which I hope shows my intent to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with a price of 70 ZUP, which is still above our maximum budget. We should propose a price closer to our limit, potentially meeting halfway between our last offer and Player RED's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and may lead to a compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your increased offer. To meet in the middle, how about 65 ZUP for one unit of X? This is a bit higher than your current offer but still below your maximum budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Their offer of 55 ZUP is still below what I would like, but it's getting closer. Let's counter once more at a slightly higher price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I'm willing to meet you at the upper limit of my budget, which is 60 ZUP for one unit of X. This is the highest amount I can commit to while staying within my financial constraints. I hope this can be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP, which is closer to our maximum budget but still above it. Since we are getting closer to an agreement, it might be beneficial to make a final offer that is at our maximum budget, signaling our final position in this negotiation.
