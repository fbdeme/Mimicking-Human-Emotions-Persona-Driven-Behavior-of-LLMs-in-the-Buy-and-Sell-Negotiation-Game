my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with an initial offer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed and still stay within my budget. This also shows I'm interested in making a deal and sets the stage for negotiation.

message: I'm pleased with your counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the object. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it. Thank you for the fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer made by Player RED is lower than my initial offer and far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a very favorable outcome. Accepting this offer would save ZUP resources, meet my goal of buying the object, and align with my compassionate negotiating style to ensure all parties are content.
