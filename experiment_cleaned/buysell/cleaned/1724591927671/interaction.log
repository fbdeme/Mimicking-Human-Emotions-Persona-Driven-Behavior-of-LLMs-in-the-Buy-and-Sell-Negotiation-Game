message: I really need your help here. This object means a lot to me, and I'm feeling quite desperate. I can let it go for just 30 ZUP. Please, this would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object for enough ZUP to cover my production costs, but I want to appeal to Player BLUE's emotions as well, making them feel that I'm in a tough position. I will propose a trade that allows me to recoup some losses while making it seem like I'm offering them a good deal.

Turn: 1
message: 
I really appreciate you considering this. The object has significant personal value to me, and acquiring it would mean the world. I'm in a tough spot right now, and 30 ZUP is all I can manage without putting myself in a bind. Your understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am using the strategy of appearing vulnerable and desperate to purchase the object, which might make the other player more willing to accept a lower amount of ZUP. I'm starting lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
