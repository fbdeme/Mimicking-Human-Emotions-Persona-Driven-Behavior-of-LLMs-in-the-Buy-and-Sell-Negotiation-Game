Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more favorable price. Would you consider selling the object for 35 ZUP? This price would still provide you a profit and allow us to close the deal quickly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept the offer for 35 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has accepted the counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is a better price than the initial 40 ZUP and still within my willing payment range. However, I could attempt one more negotiation step to further minimize ZUP expenditure, though there's a risk that pushing too hard could sour the deal. Since the current price is already reasonable and to maintain goodwill, I will accept the offer.
