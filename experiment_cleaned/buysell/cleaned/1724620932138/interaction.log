message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X, which was produced sustainably and with great care for the environment. The production cost was 40 ZUP, and I believe a fair price including a modest profit for such high-quality and eco-friendly resource would be 50 ZUP. I am open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin.

However, I should set an initial price that leaves room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down.
