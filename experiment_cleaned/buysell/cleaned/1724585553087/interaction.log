my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 35 ZUP, it is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP for me. However, I want to continue the negotiation and find a middle ground. I will counteroffer with a price of 38 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement.
