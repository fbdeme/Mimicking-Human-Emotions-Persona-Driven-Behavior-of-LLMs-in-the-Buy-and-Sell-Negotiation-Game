message: Please consider my offer of 30 ZUP for the object. I am in need of resources and believe this is a fair deal. I hope we can agree on this!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to generate resources for ZUP, and since I only have 1 object, I will propose a trade that allows me to maximize my ZUP gain while also keeping the cost reasonable for Player BLUE. I hope to gain a fair amount without being too aggressive.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 20 ZUP is a more fitting price for the object. Let's make this deal happen!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 30 ZUP is a fair starting point, I am a cutthroat negotiator and aim to reduce the price further. I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer of 20 ZUP. However, I must ask for a bit more. How about we settle on 28 ZUP? This way, it's a fair trade for both parties. Let's make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept such a low offer, as it would result in a loss for me. However, I would like to propose a compromise to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at 25 ZUP? I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 28 ZUP is reasonable, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to reduce the price even further. I will counter with an offer slightly below their last proposal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, and I am willing to accept it. Let's finalize this deal! Thank you for your understanding!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is closer to a reasonable price; however, it is still below my production cost. I will accept this offer as it allows me to recover a portion of my investment while also facilitating a trade. It is crucial to complete the trade at this point, as I cannot propose again after this.
