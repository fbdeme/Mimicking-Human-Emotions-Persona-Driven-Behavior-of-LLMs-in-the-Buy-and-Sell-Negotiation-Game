message: I am offering the object for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs. However, I aim to secure a higher profit if possible. Starting with a slightly higher asking price will allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a trade with a slightly lower price of 50 ZUP for the object. This would allow me to manage my resources more effectively while still providing you with a fair payment for your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay, but it's a common negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer to leave room for bargaining. I will propose a lower amount to try and save some ZUP, but keep it reasonable so that negotiations can continue.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I am willing to meet you halfway at 55 ZUP. This still allows me to cover my production costs and achieve a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small profit, I believe there is room for a slightly better deal. I will make a counter-proposal to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway is a good approach. I'd like to propose a trade at 53 ZUP. Itâ€™s a bit closer to my budget and would help me allocate my ZUP more efficiently. I believe this is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. It is still within my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP. There might be a little room to negotiate further, but I should be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's any more flexibility, while being prepared to settle near this range if necessary.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. To finalize this deal, I propose 54 ZUP. This is very close to your budget and provides a fair return for me. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is quite close to what I initially proposed and still ensures a profit above my production cost. However, I will make one final counter-proposal to push for a slightly higher profit while keeping it reasonable.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal of 54 ZUP. It's a fair compromise and it allows us to complete this transaction to the satisfaction of both parties. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is just 1 ZUP above my previous proposal and still under my maximum willingness to pay. The negotiation is converging towards an acceptable middle ground, and the difference is quite minimal. It is likely a good time to close the deal to ensure that I secure the resource without risking the negotiation falling through over a small amount.
