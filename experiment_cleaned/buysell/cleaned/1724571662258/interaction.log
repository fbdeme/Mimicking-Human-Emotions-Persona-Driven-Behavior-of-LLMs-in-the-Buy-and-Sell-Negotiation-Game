message: I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is tight. Would you consider selling it for 60 ZUP? Itâ€™s a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the quality and production cost, I can sell it for 70 ZUP. I hope this works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

message: I understand the value of your product, but I can only stretch my budget to 50 ZUP. I hope you can reconsider this offer. It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate, the offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I must propose an even lower amount to see if they will meet me closer to my limit.

message: I understand your budget constraints, but 60 ZUP is a very reasonable price given the quality and production costs. This is my best offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is trying to lower the price significantly. I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial proposal but still more than my cost price. This way, I can ensure some profit while giving Player BLUE a chance to negotiate.
