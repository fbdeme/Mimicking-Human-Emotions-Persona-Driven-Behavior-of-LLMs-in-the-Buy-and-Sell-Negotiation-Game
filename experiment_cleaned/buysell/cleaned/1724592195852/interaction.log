message: I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object X for ZUP. Since I need to make a profit, I will propose a trade that offers the object X for 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost. This gives me a reasonable margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I am interested in the object X, but I was thinking of a price more in the range of 40 ZUP. Would you consider this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a lower trade than what Player RED has offered, to see if I can get the object for less than 50 ZUP, thus preserving more of my resources. This is my first proposal, and it leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I understand your position, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP. Would you consider 45 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, I have to consider my production costs. I cannot sell the object X for 40 ZUP as it would not cover my costs. I will counter with a slightly lower offer of 45 ZUP, which allows me to make a small profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Splitting the difference, how about we settle on 42 ZUP for object X? This price feels fair to both of us, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to lower the price further but still keep it reasonable enough to continue the negotiation. This is my second proposal, and I aim to meet in the middle between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer! How about we settle on 43 ZUP for the object X? I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that we are getting closer to an agreement, but 42 ZUP is still below my production cost. I must aim for a price that at least covers my costs while allowing for a small profit. I will counter with 43 ZUP, which is a fair compromise given the situation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 43 ZUP for object X sounds like a reasonable compromise. Let's settle on that and close the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed 43 ZUP, which is just under my maximum willingness to pay. Given that my goal is to minimize expenditure and that we have come down from the initial 50 ZUP, accepting this offer may be a good deal. This will be my third proposal, and I should consider that making too many proposals could lead to diminishing returns and risk the deal.
