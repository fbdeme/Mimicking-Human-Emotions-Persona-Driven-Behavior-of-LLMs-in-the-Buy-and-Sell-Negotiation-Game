message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering production costs and market conditions, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start with a proposal that's above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and aim to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object X instead. I believe this is fair and helps me maintain my resource sustainability goals.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for the object X is reasonable and within my budget. However, since I am an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize my spending to preserve resources for future generations. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than 50 ZUP, which would still provide value for both parties while allowing me to save resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your sustainability goals and appreciate your offer. However, to ensure that I can continue to produce high-quality items like object X, I need to maintain a profit margin. How about we meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal? Let's say 45 ZUP for object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount it cost to produce the resource, which doesn't provide any profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above production cost to aim for a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and the willingness to meet halfway. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP for object X is a reasonable compromise between my initial proposal and Player RED's offer. It is within my budget and aligns well with my goal of minimizing ZUP spending while still allowing Player RED to maintain a profit margin. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
