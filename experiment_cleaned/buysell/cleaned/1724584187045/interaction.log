my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that maximizes my gain while ensuring I receive a sufficient amount of ZUP to cover my costs. I will propose to sell the object X for 40 ZUP, which is equal to my cost of production. This way, I aim to break even.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for object X instead. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price since the seller has stated that this is their cost of production. I want to propose a lower amount to see if they are flexible.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I can only sell the object X for 35 ZUP. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 30 ZUP would mean I incur a loss, as it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer closer to my original asking price of 40 ZUP. I will propose 35 ZUP instead, which is still below my cost but more acceptable than 30 ZUP.

message: Thank you for the updated offer! I would like to propose 32 ZUP for object X. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now offering object X for 35 ZUP, which is a step closer to my preferred price. However, I still believe I can negotiate further, as I would like to pay less if possible. I'll propose 32 ZUP to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer! How about I sell you object X for 34 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, and closer to my last proposed price of 35 ZUP. It is clear that the buyer is trying to negotiate down, but I want to minimize my loss. I will counter with 34 ZUP to try and meet in the middle while still getting a better deal than 32 ZUP.

reason: The seller has now offered object X for 34 ZUP, which is an improvement over their previous offers. While it's still above my last counter-offer of 32 ZUP, it is within my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this trade, as it is still a reasonable price.
