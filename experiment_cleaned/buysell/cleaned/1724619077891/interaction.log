message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to your thoughts and counter-proposals. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

reason: As it cost me 40 ZUP to produce my resource, I would like to at least break even or make a small profit. However, since I prioritize collaboration, I'm willing to start with a fair opening offer that leaves room for negotiation with Player BLUE.
