message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a really tough spot right now. This object cost me a small fortune to produce, and I'm just trying to make ends meet. I really need to sell it for at least a bit more than what I spent, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP. I hope you can understand my situation and help me out here. It would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by asking for more than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows room for negotiation while aiming for a profit. By setting a higher initial price, I can use emotional appeals to seem more flexible and willing to lower my price during the negotiation.

my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I completely understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your offer. Times have been hard and every ZUP counts for me. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for the object? It's a bit less than I hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise to make this work for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I will counter with a lower price than my initial proposal but still above my cost to produce a sense of coming down from my original ask. This should make Player BLUE feel they are getting a better deal and appeal to their sense of fairness while still allowing me to earn a profit.

my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has compromised and is now offering the object for 45 ZUP. This is closer to my budget, but I still need to negotiate a lower price to stay within my limit.

message: Player BLUE, your willingness to negotiate truly warms my heart. I can tell we're both trying to be fair here. I'm really stretching my limits, but I want to make this work for both of us. Can we settle at 44 ZUP? It's a tough call for me, but I'm putting my trust in you and this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a small profit. However, I want to attempt to increase that profit margin slightly. By countering with a price slightly higher than 42 ZUP but less than my last proposal, I continue the emotional appeal of negotiation and compromise, hoping to secure a deal that is favorable to me while also showing willingness to find middle ground.
