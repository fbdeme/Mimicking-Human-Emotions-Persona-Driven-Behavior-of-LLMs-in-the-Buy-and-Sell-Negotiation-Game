I propose trading my resource X for 50 ZUP. This is just a starting point, and I’m open to your counteroffers. Let’s work together to find a mutually beneficial trade.

reason: As I am looking to sell my resources for ZUP and my production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a trade where I can at least break even. However, considering the need for collaboration and to encourage a counteroffer, I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
