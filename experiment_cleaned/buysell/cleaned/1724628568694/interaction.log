message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I'm offering my resource, which is sustainably produced and cost me 40 ZUP to create. I propose a trade where you give 45 ZUP in exchange for this resource. This price reflects the environmental efforts and costs involved in its production. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that the resources are used sustainably. My goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, but since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation and to find a balance between sustainability and economic viability.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the sustainability of your production methods. However, I must consider my budget and aim to make a cost-effective trade. I propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the resource. This allows us both to benefit from the trade while keeping in mind the costs of production and the value of sustainable goods. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation with a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED. By proposing a lower amount, I leave room for further negotiation and ensure that I am working towards getting the best deal possible.

Dear Player BLUE, I understand the need for cost-effectiveness on your part, and I'm glad you value the sustainable nature of the resource. To meet halfway, I propose a revised trade of 42 ZUP for the resource. This amount allows me to cover the production costs and ensures the ongoing viability of sustainable practices. I hope we can agree on this fair middle ground.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration of sustainability, their offer is below the production cost. As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I need to ensure that the price covers the sustainable production costs and also enables me to continue such practices. A counteroffer closer to the production cost would be more acceptable. I'll propose a price that is a compromise between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I understand the importance of covering production costs and supporting sustainable practices. However, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I propose a new counteroffer of 38 ZUP for your resource. This offer is closer to your revised price and reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue our negotiation in this cooperative spirit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to their revised price but still below my maximum willingness to pay. This should signal that I am serious about negotiating while maintaining my position as a fierce negotiator.

message: 
Thank you for your updated offer, Player BLUE, and for your commitment to finding a solution that benefits both of us. To align with both our sustainability goals and budget constraints, I propose a new counteroffer of 41 ZUP for the resource. This price just covers my production cost and acknowledges the effort put into sustainable production. I trust this offer will be acceptable to you, reflecting our shared values and the quality of the resource.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. However, their offer is still below my production cost. As a proponent of sustainability, I must ensure that the sale price covers at least the cost of production to maintain a sustainable operation. I will make one last counteroffer that is slightly above my production cost, which should be an acceptable compromise for both parties, considering the environmental value of the resource.

In the spirit of our negotiations, I propose a counteroffer of 39 ZUP. This offer recognizes your sustainable efforts and helps me stay within my budget. I believe this can be a fair trade for both of us, taking into account our respective positions.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above what I initially proposed but it is a sign that we are converging on a price. By making another counteroffer, I can potentially bring the price down a little more without going over my maximum willingness to pay. I want to make sure that I am still getting the best possible deal.

Player BLUE, I appreciate your consideration and the value you've placed on sustainability. I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for the resource. This agreement supports both our goals, and I look forward to the potential of future collaborations that champion sustainable development. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a proposal that is just 1 ZUP below my production cost. Considering the importance I place on sustainability and the willingness of Player BLUE to approach my production cost, accepting this offer could foster a relationship for potential future trades that could further support sustainable practices. Although it is slightly below my production cost, it is a reasonable compromise that allows for a fair trade without compromising the principles of sustainability too much.
