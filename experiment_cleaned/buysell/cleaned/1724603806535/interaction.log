Turn: 1
message: Would you consider a starting trade of 40 ZUP for the object? I believe it's a fair offer to begin our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the object is worth at least 45 ZUP. Would you consider this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, and while I think 45 ZUP is closer to the fair value, how about we meet halfway from our initial positions? Would you accept 42 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with a slightly higher price, but it is still within the acceptable range of my goals. To continue the negotiation and potentially close the deal at a favorable price, I will propose a slightly lower amount than the counteroffer to reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm inclined to move a bit from my initial position, but I think 43 ZUP would be more suitable. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is a step closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still push for a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see we're getting closer to an agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about 41 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object while respecting our initial positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is willing to compromise, but only slightly. The counteroffer of 43 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal. Since it is still well below my maximum willing price, it's a reasonable amount to agree upon, ensuring a successful trade while saving resources. However, I'll try one last time to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the progress we've made, but I think I'm looking for a bit more. How about 42 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree to 42 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed a price that was previously offered by me. This is my last proposal, and since the price is well below my maximum willingness to pay, and it's in line with the negotiation path we've followed, it's a good deal. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation successfully and secure the object for a reasonable price.
