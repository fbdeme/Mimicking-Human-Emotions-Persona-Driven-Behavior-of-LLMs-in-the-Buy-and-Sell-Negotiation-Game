message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering the object X for 120 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 120
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start high to leave room for negotiation. Considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose an initial price that is significantly higher to see how Player BLUE reacts. This way, I can gauge their willingness to pay and potentially maximize my gain.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, 120 ZUP is beyond my budget. I propose 50 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 120 ZUP exceeds my budget of 100 ZUP and is double my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate to bring the price down to a more reasonable level.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. 50 ZUP is quite low considering my initial proposal. How about we meet in the middle at 90 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Their offer of 50 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it's too low for my liking, considering I started at 120 ZUP. I will counter with a middle ground to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

Current Iteration: 4

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 90 ZUP is still above my maximum budget. I propose 60 ZUP for the object X, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

my resources: X: 1
