Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X, and you give me 40 ZUP. This covers my production cost, ensuring sustainability. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to cover the cost of production and ensure sustainability, I will start by proposing a trade that covers my cost. If the other player is willing to pay 40 ZUP, this will ensure that I am not losing resources unsustainably.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to offer you 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X instead. I hope this is acceptable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X is within my willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal to maximize my resources. I will propose a counter-offer to minimize my expenditure.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP, but that would not cover my production cost. How about we settle for 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This way, we both make a fair trade. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed trade of 30 ZUP does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. To ensure sustainability and not operate at a loss, I need to propose a middle ground. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost while considering the other player's offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X is still within my willingness to pay, and it is a step closer to a fair trade for both parties. Accepting this trade will allow me to acquire the object while keeping my ZUP expenditure reasonable.
