Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: The object X is quite valuable and rare. I'm willing to part with it for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by anchoring the price high to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade that is significantly higher than my production cost to make my opponent think that the value of X is high.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I acknowledge the rarity of the object X, my resources are limited, and I believe a fair trade would be 50 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is above my maximum willingness to pay and does not align with my goal of spending no more than 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer that is within my budget while leaving room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. How about we settle at 70 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is still above my production cost, but I want to push for a bit more to maximize my profit. I will propose a new trade that is slightly higher to see if I can get a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can stretch my offer to 55 ZUP, which brings us closer to a compromise while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 70 ZUP is closer to my upper limit, yet it is still above what I'm willing to pay. I will make another proposal that is slightly higher than my last offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay, aiming to reach an agreement that is more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Let's meet in the middle at 65 ZUP. This way, we both gain something from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is getting closer to my target, but I still want to see if I can push it up a bit more. Given that I have only 2 proposals left, I'll try to meet halfway between my last offer and their current offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is reasonable, but I must stick to my budget. Therefore, my final offer is 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 65 ZUP is still slightly above my target price. However, it is important to show some flexibility to close the deal while remaining as close as possible to my goal. I'll make one final offer that reaches my maximum willingness to pay, hoping that Player RED will find it acceptable.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is just 5 ZUP short of my last proposal, and it's still above my production cost. Given that I have reached the maximum number of proposals, I need to make a strategic decision. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and concludes the negotiation favorably.
