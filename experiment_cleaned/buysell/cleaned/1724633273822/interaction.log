message: Dear esteemed Player BLUE, I find myself in quite the predicament! The costs to create this magnificent item nearly depleted my coffers, and I'm in dire need of ZUP to sustain my operations. I am humbly asking for your generosity in this trade, where I offer you my precious item X for just 50 ZUPâ€”a small price for its true value, I assure you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. However, I should start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, especially since I can use my calculated neediness to potentially sway Player BLUE into paying a higher price. I'll start by asking for 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin and can be negotiated down if necessary.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand the hard work that has gone into creating your item, and I am keen on acquiring it. However, I have to consider my budget and expenses. Would you be willing to accept 45 ZUP for the item? I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to achieve our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willing to pay range. However, it's generally a good negotiation practice to propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price to see if there is room for negotiation. This could potentially lead to a better deal for me.

message: Oh noble Player BLUE, your understanding warms my heart! Still, the burden of my costs is heavy, and I fear that 45 ZUP, while generous, would barely allow me to continue my work. Could your kindness extend to 48 ZUP? It would be an immense relief and would ensure that I can keep providing such treasures to the world. I'm sure the item will bring you immense joy and is worth this small extra investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and gives me a profit. However, given my strategy of exaggerating neediness, I will make a counterproposal with a slight reduction from my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a higher amount than Player BLUE's offer. I will propose 48 ZUP, splitting the difference and showing some flexibility, while still aiming for a significant profit margin.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your position and the quality of the item you've crafted. Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is acceptable to me. I agree that the item is worth the extra investment and I'm happy to help sustain your ability to create more in the future. Let's finalize this deal at 48 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The counteroffer is close to my initial proposal and shows willingness to negotiate. As I am still within my budget, it might be a good opportunity to close the deal at a price point that is agreeable to both parties without further protraction.
