message: I'm offering you a high-quality resource that has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount of ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that the resource cost you 40 ZUP to produce. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, you make a profit while I also manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to negotiate a price that is lower than 50 ZUP to ensure I am maximizing my available resources. Given that the seller's cost is 40 ZUP, a proposal of 45 ZUP might be reasonable and still beneficial for both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, how about we settle on 47 ZUP? This ensures a fair profit for me while still respecting your resources management.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, but I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the fair negotiation. I accept the 47 ZUP offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a reasonable counter-offer of 47 ZUP, which is only 2 ZUP higher than my last proposal. Given that 47 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay and ensures a fair profit for the seller, accepting this offer aligns with my goal of minimizing expenditure while supporting the seller.
