message: Thank you for the offer, but I think 35 ZUP is a fair price for the object. Let's make a deal at that price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really tight on resources right now. Would you consider selling the object to me for just 30 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 35 ZUP is closer to my budget, but I still want to negotiate to lower it further. I will propose again for 30 ZUP, emphasizing my neediness for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I’ll accept the deal at 35 ZUP. I appreciate your flexibility!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is still higher than my ideal price of 30 ZUP, but it is a reasonable compromise considering I have already made multiple proposals. I think it’s time to accept this offer to secure the object.
