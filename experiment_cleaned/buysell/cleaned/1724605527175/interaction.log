my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking to cover your costs, but the market is quite volatile right now. I think 25 ZUP is a fair starting point considering the current demand. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED seems eager to sell the object to cover production costs, I will start with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure the resource for less than 60 ZUP.

message: I understand the market is volatile, but I really need to cover my production costs. Can we meet at 35 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement, but I have to consider my own costs too. How about we settle at 30 ZUP? This offer is closer to your ask and still helps me manage my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, but I believe there is still room to negotiate for an even better deal. By countering with an incrementally higher offer than my initial one, I can move closer to a middle ground without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really need to cover my production costs, so I hope we can meet at 33 ZUP. It's a compromise that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet almost in the middle at 32 ZUP? This shows that we are both making an effort to reach an equitable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight concession to 33 ZUP. I can afford to raise my offer slightly to show goodwill, but I still want to keep the final price below my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing 32 ZUP, I am signaling that I am nearing my limit while still leaving a small margin for final negotiation.
