message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure you'll find valuable. My starting offer is generous considering the production costs and the current market value. Let's begin negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial proposal will be high to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. Starting high also gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit margin above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot agree to your terms as they exceed my budget. Let’s try again with a more reasonable proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is too high for my budget, as I am only willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the resource. I need to propose a lower trade to align with my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns. Let's find a middle ground. How about we go for 60 ZUP? This is still a competitive price for the value you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
