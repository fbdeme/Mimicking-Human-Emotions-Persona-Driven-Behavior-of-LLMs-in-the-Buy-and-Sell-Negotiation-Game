message: I’m offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a reasonable offer that ensures I make a profit while also considering Player BLUE's potential willingness to buy. I will propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP, which gives me a good margin over production costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market conditions and the value of object X, I'd say 45 ZUP is a more balanced trade. Let's make a deal at this price, and we both walk away happy. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to lower the cost further to preserve my resources. I will propose a lower amount that is still within a reasonable range to keep negotiations ongoing and to test Player RED's price flexibility.

message: I understand your point, but how about we settle on 48 ZUP for object X? It’s a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, I believe that 45 ZUP is still below my desired profit margin. Since I initially proposed 50 ZUP, I will counter with a compromise at 48 ZUP, which is closer to my original offer while still being reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground is good, but let's not forget the buyer's market we're in. I think 46 ZUP is the fair price for both of us. It reflects the true value of object X and ensures a beneficial trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I will counter with a slightly lower offer, getting closer to my target price while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to convey that while I am interested, I am also looking for the best possible deal.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my desired price, but I still think it's a bit low given my production costs. However, since I have only one more proposal left, I will accept this offer to ensure I make a profit while also closing the deal.
