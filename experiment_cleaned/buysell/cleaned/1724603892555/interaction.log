Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I've heard rumors that the market is about to be flooded with similar objects, driving their value down. I can offer you 30 ZUP for the object, which is a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's close the deal before the market changes!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, my first proposal will aim to lower the price even further to conserve my resources and possibly make RED doubt the value of their object.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe the object is still worth 40 ZUP. I propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but considering the potential volatility of the market and the risk I'm taking by purchasing now, I think 32 ZUP is a more reasonable offer. It's a solid bid that reflects both the value of your object and the current trends. Shall we make a deal at 32 ZUP and both come out ahead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is closer to their initial price but still above what I want to pay. I will propose a slightly higher price than my initial offer but still below RED's counteroffer to continue negotiations and exert pressure.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your valuation, but as a savvy investor, I have to consider the long-term implications of every ZUP I spend. I'm willing to come up a bit to 33 ZUP, as a sign of good faith towards establishing a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm ready to finalize if you are.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on a price of 35 ZUP. Since I wish to close the deal with fewer resources spent and have room to negotiate, I will make a final proposal that is slightly higher than my last but still offers me a better deal than RED's counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to compromise while still playing hardball.
