Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the 1 unit of X. Letâ€™s see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is reasonable and within my budget. However, I believe we can negotiate a better price that works for both of us, so I will propose to offer 40 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but selling at cost doesn't cover the investment made into the resource. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for the unit of X, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact production cost, which does not provide any profit. I'll counter with a reduced amount but still above production cost to ensure a profit margin.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise between our initial proposals. Since it is still below my maximum budget of 60 ZUP and aligns with my goals, I am willing to accept this trade.
