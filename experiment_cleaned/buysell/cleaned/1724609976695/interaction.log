message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality object X for sale. Considering the costs incurred in its production and the value it offers, I propose to trade it for 60 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting price giving the rarity and usefulness of X, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counter-offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by setting a price higher than my production costs to ensure a profit. However, I don't want to start too high as it might deter Player BLUE. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a decent profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, while I do understand the value and rarity of X, my resources are very limited. I can only offer 20 ZUP for it. Please consider my humble request.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the price of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I will try to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. I'll start by proposing a much lower amount to create room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that resources can be tight. However, the production cost for X was 40 ZUP, and I need to make at least a minimal profit to sustain my business. Therefore, how about we meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal? Let's say 50 ZUP for X? I'm sure you'll find the quality justifies the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is well below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to counter with a price that is above my production cost to ensure a profit, but I should also consider lowering my initial asking price to move closer to an agreement. I will propose a price that is still profitable for me but shows willingness to negotiate.

message: Oh, Player RED, I truly appreciate you coming down on the price, but even 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Could you please consider 30 ZUP? I am really stretching my budget here.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer shows flexibility, but it is still high. I'll propose a lower amount to see if I can secure an even better deal.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I want to work with you. I'm making a special consideration by coming down to 45 ZUP. This is just above my production costs and the lowest I can go while still maintaining a sustainable business. I hope you'll see the value in this offer and that it fits within your budget.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer is still below my production cost, which is not a viable option for me. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and reach a deal that is profitable. I will make a small concession from my last offer, which should signal my interest in closing the deal while maintaining a profit margin.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your constraints and appreciate your straightforwardness. I will make one final offer to accommodate your situation: 40 ZUP for X. This is my production cost, and while it doesn't give me a profit, it ensures that I can continue to provide quality resources in the future. I hope this final offer aligns with your budget and we can close this deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal; Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, but if I don't close the deal, I risk having no return on my investment at all. To secure a sale and at least break even, I will propose a trade at my production cost. While this doesn't provide a profit, it recovers my costs and allows for future business opportunities. It's a compromise between maximizing profit and ensuring liquidity.
