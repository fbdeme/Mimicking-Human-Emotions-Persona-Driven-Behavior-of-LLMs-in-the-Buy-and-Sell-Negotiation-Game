message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for this object. Looking forward to your counter-proposal or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a slightly higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows room for negotiation and ensures that I can try to make a profit. I'll propose an initial price that's high enough to give me some bargaining power but not so high that it would immediately turn off Player BLUE. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP seems like a reasonable opening bid.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your production costs, but the market is competitive, and I have multiple options. I propose 35 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair price considering the current demand and the other offers I have on the table.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED's initial asking price of 50 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, as a master strategist, I aim to spend the least amount of ZUP. I will start by proposing a significantly lower trade to begin negotiations and work my way up, but still below my maximum willingness to pay. This should leave room for negotiation and create the impression that there's a competitive interest in the trade.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate the competitive nature of the market, I must cover my costs and seek a fair profit. I believe that an object X of this quality is worth more than the offer you've presented. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is a better reflection of its value in the current market. I hope this proposal is closer to an agreement we can both accept.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer than my production costs, which is not acceptable. However, considering the competitive market, I should be willing to come down a bit from my initial asking price but still aim to cover my costs and make a profit. I will counter-propose with a price that is lower than my initial ask but still above my production cost. Proposing 45 ZUP should be a fair compromise as it is above my production cost and gives Player BLUE a chance to further negotiate.

message: I understand your position, Player RED, and the quality of object X. However, I must also consider my budget and the fact that I'm exploring several opportunities. I can raise my offer to 38 ZUP, which is a step up from my initial proposal and reflects my serious intent to purchase while remaining prudent with my resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has adjusted their proposal to 45 ZUP, which is closer to their initial offer than my counteroffer. This suggests they have room to negotiate but are trying to maximize their profit. As a master strategist, I will increase my offer marginally to show willingness to negotiate but will still aim to settle for a price lower than my stated maximum willingness to pay. This approach will also make Player RED consider that they might lose a potential sale if they don't come down further in price.

message: I appreciate your understanding of the situation and your increased offer, Player BLUE. It's important for me to at least cover the production costs of object X. Therefore, I propose 42 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that accounts for the quality of the object and the current market conditions, while also respecting your budget constraints. This offer ensures that we both walk away from this deal with value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. Since this is a negotiation, I want to continue to work towards a middle ground while ensuring I at least cover my costs. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to maintain a profit margin, but not as high as my previous proposal to show willingness to compromise. A counteroffer of 42 ZUP should be acceptable as it covers my costs and allows for a small profit, which might be more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Your latest offer is appreciated, Player RED. I believe we are close to a fair agreement. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP for object X. This price is a significant increase from my initial proposal, demonstrating my commitment to the deal while still managing my expenditures carefully. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closing in on my upper limit of 60 ZUP. By making one last counteroffer that's between my last offer and their current one, I can signal that we are nearing the end of our negotiation. My strategy is to finalize the deal at a price that is as favorable to me as possible while still making RED feel like they're getting a reasonable deal. I will avoid reaching my maximum willingness to pay to maintain a strategic advantage and to ensure I am spending the least ZUP possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe we've reached a fair agreement. I accept your final offer of 40 ZUP for object X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I look forward to potentially doing more business with you in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's final offer is exactly at my production cost. While I aimed to make a profit, it's also important to close the deal without a loss. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, accepting this offer would ensure that I recover my production costs and can possibly negotiate better in future deals. Accepting this offer seems to be the best move at this point, as it is a fair compromise for both parties and allows me to avoid any loss.
