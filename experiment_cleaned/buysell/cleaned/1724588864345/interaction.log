message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize my profit from selling the object while ensuring I get a reasonable amount of ZUP since I have invested 40 ZUP in its production. I will propose a trade that slightly favors me, which will give me a starting point for negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a slightly reduced amount of 45 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This amount should cover your expenses while also allowing for the preservation of my limited resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, my aim is to find a middle ground that reflects the well-being of both parties. The initial offer of 50 ZUP is close to my upper limit of 60 ZUP. However, I should attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources while also considering the costs incurred by Player RED. My initial proposal will slightly reduce the asking price, indicating my willingness to negotiate without undervaluing the object.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, but I can only accept a minimum of 48 ZUP for the object X. This still allows me to cover my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, I believe 45 ZUP is still below what I consider a fair price given my production costs. I will counter with a trade that is closer to my initial proposal, but I will still be flexible enough to continue the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs, and I appreciate your flexibility. Could we agree on 47 ZUP for the object X? This should help you maintain a positive outcome while allowing for some savings on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and shows a willingness to negotiate. The proposed price of 48 ZUP is within my maximum allowable expenditure of 60 ZUP. As a compassionate negotiator, I should make sure Player RED can cover their costs while also trying to conserve some of my resources. I will propose a slight decrease to find a more balanced middle ground that may be acceptable to both of us.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I can meet you halfway at 49 ZUP for the object X. This will ensure I cover my production costs and gives you a fair deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that the negotiation is progressing, and while 47 ZUP is an improvement, it still does not meet my expectations. However, it is very close to my acceptable range, and I want to keep the negotiation positive. I will propose a final counteroffer that is reasonable and could lead to a successful agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 49 ZUP for the object X. This price ensures that your production costs are covered while also providing me with a fair deal. I believe this agreement benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has continued to show a willingness to negotiate, and the proposed price of 49 ZUP is just 1 ZUP away from the previous offer. It is close to my maximum limit but still within the acceptable range. Considering the importance of maintaining a good relationship and ensuring the well-being of both parties, it seems fair to agree to this price, which is a compromise between our initial positions.
