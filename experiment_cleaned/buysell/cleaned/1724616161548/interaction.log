Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and I understand your position. However, the quality and value of the object deserve a better price. How about we meet closer to the middle at 85 ZUP? This is a more reasonable figure that reflects the object's worth while still giving you a fair deal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but as a master strategist, I want to push for a higher price to maximize profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced amount from my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a higher sum than what they've offered.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're making progress. I believe that 80 ZUP is a fair compromise that honors the quality of the object while also taking into account your budget constraints. What do you say we finalize this deal at 80 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly. They seem to have a limit at or near 65 ZUP. I should make a counteroffer that's higher but still within a range that may seem acceptable to them. By doing this, I aim to secure a deal that is significantly above my cost of production, maximizing my profit while also moving towards a conclusion.
