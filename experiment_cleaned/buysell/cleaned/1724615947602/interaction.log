message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which would be a great addition to your resources. Considering the costs of production and the value it offers, I believe an offer of 50 ZUP would be a fair starting point for negotiations.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to attempt to make a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but I want to negotiate down to save some ZUP for future needs. I will propose a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need for a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? This way we both benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but I aimed to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price to encourage a deal that is still above my costs.
