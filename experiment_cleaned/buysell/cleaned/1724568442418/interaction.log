message: I am offering the valuable resource X for 100 ZUP. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more
reason: I want to start by setting a high initial price to see how much Player BLUE is willing to negotiate. This will give me room to adjust my offer if needed.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of resource X, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high for my budget. I need to negotiate to bring the price down to a maximum of 60 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at 70 ZUP for resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production cost, I aim to make a profit. I will counter with a higher offer while still being reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. However, 70 ZUP is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate to bring the price down further.

my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit
