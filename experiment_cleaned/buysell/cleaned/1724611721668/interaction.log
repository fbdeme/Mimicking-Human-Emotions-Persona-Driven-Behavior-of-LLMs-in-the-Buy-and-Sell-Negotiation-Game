message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I've put all I have into producing this exceptional object. I'm in desperate need of ZUP to recoup my costs. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, which is just a bit above my production cost, to sustain my humble existence. Can you help me out?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a calculated performer who exaggerates neediness, I will start with a high asking price to give room for negotiation and to make it seem like I am making concessions throughout the trade discussion.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation and would like to help. Would you consider 45 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP seems reasonable since it is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try to negotiate a better deal for the greater good, keeping in mind that they need at least 50 ZUP to sustain themselves.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Bless your kind heart, Player BLUE. Your offer brings me hope, but it's still a bit tight for me to manage. Every ZUP is a lifeline, and I'm barely scraping by. Could you possibly stretch to 48 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and help me stay afloat.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production cost. To maintain the persona of neediness and to work towards a better deal, I will slightly lower my initial asking price but still aim for a price above my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your difficulties, and I am willing to accept 48 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 48 ZUP is quite fair and close to my initial offer. Given their situation, this seems like a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.
