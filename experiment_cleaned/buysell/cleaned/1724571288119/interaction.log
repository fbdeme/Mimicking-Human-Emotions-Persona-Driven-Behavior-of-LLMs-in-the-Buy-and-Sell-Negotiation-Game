Turn: 1
message: Please, I truly need this object, but I'm struggling to gather enough resources. Would you consider selling it for just 50 ZUP? I would be immensely grateful for your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal, as I feel desperate for a lower price and I believe I can appeal to the seller's emotions by emphasizing my financial need.

message: I understand your situation. How about we settle at 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding! I appreciate your willingness to help me out in my time of need. I'm happy to proceed with the trade for 55 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is better than my previous proposal of 50 ZUP, and it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I feel that accepting this trade would be a reasonable compromise while still allowing me to save some ZUP.
