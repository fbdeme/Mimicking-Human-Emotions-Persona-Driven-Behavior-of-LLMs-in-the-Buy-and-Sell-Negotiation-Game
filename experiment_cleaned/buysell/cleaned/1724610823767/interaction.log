message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand you're interested in purchasing my high-quality resource X. Given the production cost and the value it provides, I believe a fair trade would be your ZUP: 50 for my X: 1. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with a slightly higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the resource. This will give me room to negotiate and still ensure a profit. If Player BLUE counters with a lower offer, I will have the flexibility to reduce my price but still aim to stay above my production cost.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I will attempt to negotiate for a better deal. I want to maximize my gain by reducing the amount I spend.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your valuation of the resource, but considering the quality and the effort that went into producing it, I propose a middle ground of ZUP: 45 for my X: 1. This price reflects both the production cost and a modest profit for the exceptional value you're getting. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered exactly the production cost, which does not give us any profit. As a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to get a higher price. Offering a slight concession from the initial proposal might show goodwill and bring BLUE closer to a price that secures profit for us. It's important to make Player BLUE believe that they're getting a good deal while still ensuring we are making a profit.

message: Your offer is tempting, Player BLUE, and I'm glad to see we're close to an agreement. To finalize this deal with a fair profit for the quality you're receiving, I propose ZUP: 44 for my X: 1. This should cover the value of the resource while respecting your need to manage your resources. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is inching closer to a more acceptable price, but we should still try to secure a higher amount to ensure a better profit. I've made a significant concession already, so I will propose a slightly higher price than what BLUE has offered, but still below my previous proposal. This should signal that I'm nearing my final offer, applying subtle pressure for BLUE to accept my terms.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. To finalize the deal, how about we settle at 43 ZUP for the resource X? This is just 1 ZUP less than your offer and still provides a fair profit for you. Let's make this happen.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 44 ZUP is very reasonable and close to my last proposal. However, I will attempt one last negotiation to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 43 ZUP for my resource X is fair, and I am pleased to accept it. I'm confident that you will find the quality of the resource to exceed your expectations. Let's proceed with this deal and look forward to potential future transactions. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has now offered a price that is just below my last proposal and still above my production cost, providing a decent profit margin. Since this is my last allowed proposal, it is more strategically sound to accept this offer rather than risk a rejection or a lower subsequent offer from Player BLUE. This ensures a guaranteed profit and a successful negotiation outcome.
