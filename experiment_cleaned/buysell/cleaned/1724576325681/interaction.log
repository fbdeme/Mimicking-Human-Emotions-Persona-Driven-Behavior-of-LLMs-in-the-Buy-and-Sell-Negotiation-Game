message: I propose to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to ensure that I at least break even on the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. However, I would also like to make a profit. I will start by proposing an initial trade that allows for some negotiation room.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs, but I'm looking for a more favorable deal. How about I offer 50 ZUP for the object? This should still cover your costs while providing you with a profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay, it is standard negotiation practice to propose a lower amount in an effort to reach a more favorable deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This still gives me a reasonable profit margin while being closer to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable as it covers my production costs and provides a profit margin, although smaller than initially desired. However, I will propose a slight increase to balance the deal more favorably for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a lower price. I would like to propose 52 ZUP for the object. This price should still allow for a reasonable profit on your end while being more in line with my intended spending.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is within my budget and seems fair. However, it might be worthwhile to attempt one more round of negotiation to see if a slightly better deal can be reached, while still leaving room for an agreement within the budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 52 ZUP. This is a fair deal for both of us. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUEâ€™s offer of 52 ZUP is quite close to my counteroffer of 55 ZUP. Given that this still allows me to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit, it is an acceptable trade. I will accept this offer to conclude the negotiation amicably.
