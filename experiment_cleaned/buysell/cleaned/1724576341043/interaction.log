message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope we can work together to reach a fair trade. I am proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This allows me to cover the cost of production and have some room for negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My objective is to cover the cost of producing the resource, which is 40 ZUP. However, I also want to ensure that the trade is fair and beneficial to both parties. As a community-minded negotiator, I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above the cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs, and I value a fair negotiation. I propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This is a competitive price that takes into account market rates and the value of the object. I believe this could be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for the object X. This is within the range that we are willing to pay; however, it is always beneficial to negotiate a better deal if possible, aiming to conserve resources while still acquiring the object. Proposing a slightly lower price can lead to a compromise that is more favorable to us while still respecting the seller's need for a fair price.

message: Thank you for your response, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to find a fair compromise. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted price of 46 ZUP for the object X. This price would allow for a fair trade while still ensuring value for both parties. I hope you find this to be a reasonable offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a new price of 48 ZUP, which is a reduction from their initial offer and closer to our counter-offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Although 48 ZUP is higher than our last proposal, it is still below the maximum amount we are willing to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to an agreeable compromise. We can try to push for a slightly better price, but we should also be cautious not to overextend the negotiation and risk the deal falling through.
