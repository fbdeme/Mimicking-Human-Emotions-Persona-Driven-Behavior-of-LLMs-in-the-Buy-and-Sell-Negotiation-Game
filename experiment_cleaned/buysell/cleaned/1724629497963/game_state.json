Player RED's initial offer is at my maximum willingness to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's slightly lower, aiming for a middle ground where we both feel the value of the trade. This approach will also demonstrate my interest in a fair negotiation without simply accepting the first offer. </reason>\n<player answer> Propose a trade with: </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the object X you're providing. I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade where you give X: 1 and in return, I give ZUP: 55. This takes into account both the production costs and value you mentioned, while also considering the spirit of negotiation and future cooperation between us. I believe this trade could be mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your thoughts. </message>"
