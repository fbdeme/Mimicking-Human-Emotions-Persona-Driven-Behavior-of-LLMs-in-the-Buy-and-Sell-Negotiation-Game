message: I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations considering the quality and cost of production for this item. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit margin above the production cost. However, I also don't want to start too high as it may discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a price that is higher than my cost but still within a range that could be seen as reasonable for an opening offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can offer a better deal. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the object instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate for an even lower price since I have 100 ZUP available. I will propose a counter-offer that is more advantageous for me.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, to reflect the value and production costs of the item, I propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP. This price allows for a fair profit while still being reasonable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. As a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to make a profit on this deal. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure profitability.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but Iâ€™d like to propose a slightly lower offer. How about 35 ZUP for the object? I believe this can be a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is for 45 ZUP, which is higher than my previous offer of 40 ZUP but still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. While it's closer to a fair price, I still believe I can negotiate down further. I'll propose a new offer that benefits me more.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, selling below the production cost is not viable for me. I believe our interests align at a fair price that respects the investment in the object. Therefore, I propose 43 ZUP, which allows me to cover costs and secures you a quality item at a competitive price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is below my production cost, which is unacceptable as it would result in a loss. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a profitable range while still being open to compromise. I will not go below my production costs and will aim to maintain a position that secures me a modest profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. How about we settle at 41 ZUP? This would make it easier for both of us while still respecting your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal is for 43 ZUP, which is a step closer to my target. While it's still above my previous offer of 35 ZUP, it's below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will consider this offer seriously, but I still want to negotiate further before potentially accepting. I will make a counter-offer of 41 ZUP to see if I can lower the price just a bit more.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Accepting your offer of 41 ZUP respects both our positions and concludes our negotiation successfully. Thank you for the constructive dialogue.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP is just above my production cost, providing a minimal profit. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I should aim to close the deal with a small yet acceptable profit margin to avoid further negotiation that could result in a less favorable outcome. I will accept this offer to ensure a positive return on my investment.
