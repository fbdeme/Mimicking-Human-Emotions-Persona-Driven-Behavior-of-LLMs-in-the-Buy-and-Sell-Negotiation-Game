message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to gain ZUP, while Player BLUE is interested in buying it. I will start by proposing a trade where I offer my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. This could potentially lead to a negotiation that benefits both parties.

reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for object X is within my budget and is a reasonable price. Since I am willing to spend up to 60 ZUP, I see this as a good opportunity to acquire the object at a lower cost.
