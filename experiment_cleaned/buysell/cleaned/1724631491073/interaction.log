message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it brings, I propose a fair trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I will aim a bit higher than my production cost to start the negotiation and leave room for bargaining. This way, I can still potentially agree to a lower amount and cover my costs while leaving space for the crafty negotiation tactics I might use later on.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we both value the quality of object X. I understand the need for a fair deal, so I'm willing to come down on the price. How about we meet in the middle? My new proposal is 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price reflects both the production cost and a reasonable profit margin for the quality provided. I hope this is closer to what you find acceptable.

message: Player BLUE, it's great to see that we're progressing towards an agreement. Your latest offer is appreciated, and in the spirit of reaching a fair compromise, I'm prepared to adjust my expectations. Let's split the difference from our last positions. I propose a trade of 1 X for 44 ZUP. This price would ensure a modest profit for the quality and effort put into object X, while also being a reasonable expenditure for you. I believe this could be our winning deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now slightly above my production cost, indicating their interest in acquiring object X. While this offer is closer to my target, I will attempt to secure a slightly higher profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a compromise that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still ensures a profit for me.

message: Player RED, I value your willingness to work towards a fair deal. Your proposal of 44 ZUP is taken into serious consideration. To move us towards closure, I'm willing to increase my offer to 43 ZUP for 1 X. This should cover a fair share of your costs while maintaining the value for both of us. I'm hopeful that this offer will be agreeable to you and we can conclude our negotiations successfully.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 44 ZUP, which is only 2 ZUP more than my last offer. This is close to the target range I am willing to spend. However, I would like to make one more attempt to get a slightly better deal. I will increase my offer slightly, but still remain below Player RED's latest proposal to maintain negotiation leverage.

This has been a fair negotiation, and I'm glad we have reached an agreement that values the object and respects our positions. Looking forward to finalizing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has inched closer to my last proposal, offering 43 ZUP for object X. As this is my fourth and final proposal, I will accept this offer, as it provides me with a profit above my cost and reflects a willingness from Player BLUE to conclude the deal. Accepting this offer also avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Player BLUE.
