message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality resource, X, which you'll find is well worth your ZUP. I propose that I give you 1 X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This is a competitive market rate for the value I'm providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to start with a high asking price to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This initial proposal is intended to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the resource X. Starting high gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit over the production cost.

message: I would like to propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the offer of 1 X for 60 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I want to ensure that I am making the best decision for both of us. I will propose a trade that is slightly more favorable for me while still being fair to you.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, considering the quality and value of X, I propose a slight adjustment. How about we settle on 1 X for 55 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of what you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 50 ZUP which is above my production cost, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I believe I can secure a higher price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a substantial profit margin.
