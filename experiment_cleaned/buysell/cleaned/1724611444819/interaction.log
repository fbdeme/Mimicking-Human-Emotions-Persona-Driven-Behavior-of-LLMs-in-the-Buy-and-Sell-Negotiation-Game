message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a really tough spot here; I've invested everything into this resource, and I'm desperate to sell it to recover my costs and keep my operations running. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, but honestly, I'm at your mercy and eager to make a deal work. Please, could you help me out here?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a calculated performer, I want to start with a proposal that is above my production cost to leave room for negotiation. I will exaggerate my need to sell, suggesting urgency and willingness to accept lower offers, potentially encouraging Player BLUE to make a concession.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand your situation and would like to help you out. Could we agree on 40 ZUP for the resource? Looking forward to finding a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I will propose a slightly lower amount initially to leave room for negotiation and reduce the expenditure.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, your kindness is beyond words! I'm grateful for your offer. I was really hoping for just a tiny bit more to cover some unexpected costs that came up. Could we possibly settle on 45 ZUP? That would mean the world to me and help me stay afloat. Your generosity is my only hope!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, but as a calculated performer, I'll try to increase the amount slightly to gain some profit while maintaining the appearance of desperation. Exaggerating my neediness may persuade Player BLUE to agree to a slightly higher price.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand your situation and appreciate your flexibility. 45 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. The amount is reasonable and ensures that Player RED can cover their unexpected costs.
