message: I've considered the environmental impact and the sustainability of our resources. The cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP. I propose a trade that covers production costs and includes a minimal mark-up for sustainability efforts. Let's work together to make a trade that is fair and environmentally friendly.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that I at least cover my production costs without encouraging excessive spending of ZUP, which could lead to unsustainable practices.
