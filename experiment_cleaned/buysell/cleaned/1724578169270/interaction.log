newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you have an object X for sale. I'm prepared to offer 60 ZUP for it. This is a fair price that matches the maximum I'm willing to pay, as the object has significant value to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am starting the negotiation with the maximum price I am willing to pay for the resource as an initial proposal to see how Player RED responds. This will provide insight into their valuation and urgency to sell. From there, I can adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially offering a lower amount if I sense hesitance or a desire to sell quickly on their part.
