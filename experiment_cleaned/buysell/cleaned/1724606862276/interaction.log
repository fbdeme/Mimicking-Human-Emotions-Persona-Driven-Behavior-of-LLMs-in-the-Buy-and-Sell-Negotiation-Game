message: Thank you for your proposal of 35 ZUP. I understand your position, but as the production cost was 40 ZUP, selling at 35 would result in a loss for me. To meet in the middle, I propose we settle on the cost price of 40 ZUP. This would cover my costs and ensure a fair transaction for both of us. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests in finding a middle ground.
