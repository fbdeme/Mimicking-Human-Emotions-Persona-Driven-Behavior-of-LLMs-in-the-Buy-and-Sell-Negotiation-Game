message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe is worth your investment. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I think a fair trade would be 60 ZUP. What do you say?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit from this sale. I'll start by setting a higher initial price to leave room for negotiation, anticipating that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I appreciate your feedback. Let's find a middle ground. How about we reduce the price to 50 ZUP? This price reflects the quality and value of object X while also taking into account your willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has expressed that the initial asking price is too high. To facilitate a trade and still secure a profit, I'll reduce the price but still keep it above my production costs. This shows willingness to negotiate and may prompt Player BLUE to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and want to ensure we both walk away satisfied. I'm prepared to offer object X for just 45 ZUP. This is a competitive price that takes into account both the production value and market conditions. I believe this is a very fair offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still not satisfied with the price, indicating a desire for a better deal. Since I need to make a sale and still want to make a profit, I will make a further concession in price but keep it above my production cost to ensure profitability. This may be close to the maximum Player BLUE is willing to pay.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. In the interest of reaching an agreement and with consideration to your willingness to pay, I'm willing to make a final offer of 42 ZUP for object X. This offer is just above my production cost, providing you with a great value for your investment.

reason: Player BLUE is still not agreeing to the proposed prices, and this is my last opportunity to propose a trade. I must make a final offer that still ensures a profit but is also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will offer a minimal profit margin to close the deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Given the circumstances, it might be better to reject the offer and find a buyer who is willing to pay a price closer to my desired value.
