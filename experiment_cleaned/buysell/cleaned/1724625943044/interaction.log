message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates the production cost and offers a reasonable profit for the efforts. I propose a starting trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. I'm open to hear your thoughts and work towards a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs such as the effort, time, and risk I have taken on by producing the resource. I'm aiming for a collaborative approach, so I won't start with an excessively high price.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 X. This price still ensures you make a profit above your production cost while also being a competitive offer from my side. I believe this could be a good starting point for our discussion. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has set an initial offer of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a fierce negotiator aiming to lower costs, I will counter with a lower offer to see if there's room for negotiation and to potentially save resources.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your counteroffer and for recognizing the importance of a fair profit. I propose we meet in the middle with a trade of 1 X for 47 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and includes a modest profit margin, while still offering you a fair deal. I'm keen to come to an agreement that reflects our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to engage in the negotiation and their counteroffer. They've offered a price above my production cost, which is a good sign of their intention to reach a fair deal. However, I believe there's still room for a slight increase to ensure I'm compensated for my time and risk. I will propose a price that's a compromise between our two initial proposals.

message: Player RED, I value your willingness to find a middle ground, and I'm inclined to get closer to your asking price. Let's adjust the terms a bit more. How about a compromise at 46 ZUP for 1 X? This would provide you with a reasonable profit while maintaining a good deal for me. I'm confident we're approaching a fair agreement. Let's work this out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down to 47 ZUP, which is close to my initial counteroffer. However, there may be still a little room to negotiate for a better price. As a fierce negotiator, I should make another attempt to lower the cost without alienating the seller. Proposing a price slightly higher than my initial offer might show willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 X is acceptable to me. I appreciate your collaborative spirit and willingness to reach a fair deal. Let's finalize this trade at 46 ZUP and consider future opportunities where we can continue to work together with mutual benefits.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest proposal of 46 ZUP is quite close to the 47 ZUP I last proposed. Given that negotiation is about reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement, and we are only 1 ZUP apart, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. By doing so, I ensure a decent profit while also fostering a positive relationship with Player BLUE that could be beneficial for future dealings.
