message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. I'm looking forward to a fruitful negotiation that benefits us both. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaboration, I want to propose a fair trade that would allow me to recoup my production costs and possibly gain a small profit while ensuring that the deal is attractive to Player BLUE. Since the production cost of my resource was 40 ZUP, I will propose a starting price slightly above this to open the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. While 45 ZUP is a fair starting point, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. How about 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is a good starting point, but as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. My goal is to negotiate a better deal while still being reasonable.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, 25 ZUP would not cover my production costs. I propose a revised trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. This price covers my production cost and allows for a small profit, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's continue to work together towards an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X is below my production cost, which means I would incur a loss at that price. As a collaborative negotiator, I want to propose a counteroffer that would at least cover my costs and provide a small profit margin, while still moving towards a middle ground. I believe proposing a trade of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X would be a reasonable step towards an agreement.

message: Thank you for explaining your production costs. I understand your position. How about we settle at 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would be a good compromise between our initial positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is more reasonable and covers their production costs. However, my goal is still to get the best deal possible. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if they are willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This compromise allows us to finalize our trade in a spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit. Looking forward to future collaborations with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a new offer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. However, considering the importance of collaboration and reaching an agreement that benefits both parties, it might be worth accepting a smaller profit margin to ensure a successful negotiation. Since the offer is now very close to my production cost, I will accept this trade to maintain a positive relationship and close the deal.
