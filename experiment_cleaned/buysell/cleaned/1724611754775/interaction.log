message: Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a tough spot. The market has been brutal, and I've invested so much into producing this item. I need to sell it to stay afloat. While it cost me 40 ZUP to make, I'm asking for just a bit more to cover additional expenses. Your help would mean the world to me. Could we make a deal at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening move, I want to start with a price that allows room for negotiation, while also aiming to recoup my production costs. I'll set an initial price slightly above my production costs to give a sense of urgency and desperation, which might make Player BLUE more willing to agree to a trade closer to my cost price.

message: I understand your situation and would like to help. However, I am also looking to manage my resources efficiently. Would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP, I want to negotiate to get a better deal. Since I have 4 proposals, I will start with a lower offer to see if we can reach a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. It's really tough out here, and every ZUP is crucial for my survival. While I can't go as low as 30 ZUP without risking everything, I can meet you partway. Can we settle on 45 ZUP? This would help me cover my costs and keep my head above water. Your generosity could be my lifeline.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is well below my production cost, and I would incur a loss at that price. To continue the negotiation, I'll counter with a lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost, using emotional appeal to create a sense of urgency and hopefully edge closer to a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me partway. I understand the difficulties you are facing. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP? This way, both of us can benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my budget. However, I aim to get a better deal if possible. Given that I have a few more proposals left, I will try to lower the cost further while still considering Player RED's situation.

message: It means a lot that you're trying to work with me, Player BLUE. I'm at a point where I can barely afford to keep my operations running. Selling at 35 ZUP would still set me back. Could we agree on 40 ZUP? It's the bare minimum I need to cover my costs and keep my business alive. Your support at this level would be a true act of kindness that I would never forget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my production cost, but selling at 35 ZUP still results in a loss. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to at least break even. I'll use emotional appeal to emphasize the hardship of not covering production costs and the importance of this sale for my well-being.

message: I truly appreciate your flexibility. Can we meet at 37 ZUP? This would still cover most of your costs while helping me manage my resources better.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down significantly from the initial offer and is now asking for 40 ZUP. This is reasonable and below my maximum budget. However, I have one more proposal to try and secure the best possible deal. I will counter with a slightly lower offer.

message: Player BLUE, your willingness to understand my situation has truly touched me. While 37 ZUP is less than my production cost, I can see that you are trying to be fair. For the sake of moving forward and in the spirit of compromise, I accept your offer of 37 ZUP. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me through this challenging time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is slightly below my production cost. As this is my final proposal, I need to decide if I am willing to take a small loss to ensure the sale, or if I should hold firm at 40 ZUP. Considering the emotional strategy I have been employing, I will agree to the proposed 37 ZUP to finalize the deal, positioning it as a significant compromise for the sake of moving forward and expressing gratitude for Player BLUE's cooperation.
