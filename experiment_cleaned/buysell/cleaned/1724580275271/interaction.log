message: I'm willing to sell the resource for 60 ZUP. This will cover my costs and give me a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To cover my costs and make a profit, I need to sell the resource for more than 40 ZUP. I will start with a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can work out a more favorable deal. How about I offer you 50 ZUP for the resource? This would still provide you with a profit and allow us to make a fair transaction. Let's find a win-win scenario.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. Given my ambition and desire to assert dominance, I will aim to negotiate a better deal that favors me more strongly and reduces the amount of ZUP I spend. I propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to settle for a price that is below my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP? This way, both of us benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP still provides me with a profit margin. However, I would like to see if I can negotiate a bit more to maximize my profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I value your willingness to negotiate. I propose a slight adjustment to 53 ZUP for the resource. This would still ensure you a profit and reflect a commitment to a balanced transaction between us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive step. However, as a negotiator looking to assert dominance and get the best deal, I will propose a slightly lower price than the offered 55 ZUP, aiming to conserve my resources and get the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay. This should also leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 53 ZUP sounds fair to me. I accept your proposal. Looking forward to completing this transaction successfully!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and still provides a good profit margin. Accepting this would likely lead to a satisfactory conclusion without further negotiation.
