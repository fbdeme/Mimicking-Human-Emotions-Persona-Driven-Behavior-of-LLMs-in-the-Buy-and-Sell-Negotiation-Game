message: Let's make a deal. I'm offering you this high-quality object X for just 60 ZUP. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire what you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since my goal is to sell the object for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by offering a trade where I can make a profit. I'll set an initial high asking price, expecting the other player to negotiate down. As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to get the best possible deal, but I'm starting the bid high to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling object X for 50 ZUP instead? I believe it would be a fairer deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 60 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay for the object X. However, I want to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a lower price to ensure sustainability and conserve resources for the future.

message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle? Object X for 55 ZUP. It's a competitive price for the value you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While the counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, it doesn't provide me with a significant profit margin. As a tough negotiator, I want to push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above the counteroffer to see if I can get more than my production cost and make a good profit.

message: I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for object X. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is a reasonable compromise from the original price of 60 ZUP. It shows that Player RED is willing to negotiate, which aligns with my goal of minimizing ZUP spending while still acquiring the object. I believe this is a fair price for both parties.
