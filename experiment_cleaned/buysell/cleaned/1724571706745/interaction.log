newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot afford to pay 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. My maximum budget is 60 ZUP. Would you consider lowering the price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a counter-offer that aligns with my budget.

message: I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to sell 1 unit of X for 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP.
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Since this is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, I can still make a profit. I will propose a price close to their budget but slightly lower to encourage acceptance.
