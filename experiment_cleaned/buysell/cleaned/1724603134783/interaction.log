message: I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me â€“ it means a lot!

Turn: 1
message: Your understanding is incredibly appreciated, and I can see you're trying to find a fair compromise. I'm almost there, but 37 ZUP is slightly over what I had hoped to spend. I've been crunching the numbers, and I think I can make 36 ZUP work without compromising my other financial commitments. Can we agree on 36 ZUP? This would be a huge relief and would allow me to maintain stability. Thank you for considering my situation!

reason: The seller is showing flexibility, but I still want to conserve resources.
