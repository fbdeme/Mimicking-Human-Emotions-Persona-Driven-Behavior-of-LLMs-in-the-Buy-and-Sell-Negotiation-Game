message: I really need to make this trade. I hope you understand how tough things have been for me lately. Would you be willing to buy my object for just 10 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my single object X for ZUP, but I need to make a compelling proposal that makes me seem desperate. Offering a lower amount might elicit sympathy and encourage Player BLUE to accept.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the situation, and I'm willing to help by accepting your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade for 10 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would result in a favorable outcome for me, securing the resources for a much lower price than anticipated.
