message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing the object for 20 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Let's start the negotiation. Would you consider selling the object for 20 ZUP? I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My opening proposal is intentionally low to start the negotiation process. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, beginning at 20 ZUP gives me room to increase my offer while still seeking to pay less than my maximum threshold. This tactic is meant to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for me.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the fair price for the object is 30 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider that?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is a bit low. I will counteroffer to see if they are willing to increase their price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet halfway between our initial offers? I can go up to 25 ZUP for the object. This seems like a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is within my willingness to pay, but I aim to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below RED's counteroffer, I can appear reasonable and willing to compromise while still working towards a lower purchase price than they are asking.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I believe 28 ZUP would reflect the fair value of the object. Would you be open to this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is getting closer to the target price, but I'll make one final counteroffer to try to secure a better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 28 ZUP is getting closer to what I had in mind. How about 27 ZUP? I think this price reflects both the value of the object and our negotiation efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Since I have one more proposal I can make before I must decide to accept or reject, I'll make a slight increase to show continued willingness to negotiate, but I will still aim to pay less than RED's latest offer. This could lead to a final compromise that's favorable for me.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of 1 object for 27 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is quite close to the target price, and considering the cost to produce the resources, I believe it's a reasonable deal.
