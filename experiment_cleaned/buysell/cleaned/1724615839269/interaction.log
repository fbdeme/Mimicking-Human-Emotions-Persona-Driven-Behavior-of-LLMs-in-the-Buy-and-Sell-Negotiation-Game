message: I have a high-quality object X available for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to start the negotiation at 50 ZUP to cover costs and the value it provides. Let's work together to find an agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that covers my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly higher than my cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to gauge their willingness to pay.

message: I really appreciate the quality of object X, but I am currently limited in my budget. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is above my willingness to pay. I want to negotiate to lower the price while still showing interest in the object. I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can get the price down to a more manageable amount.

message: I understand your budget concerns, and I want to work with you. How about we meet halfway? I can lower my asking price to 45 ZUP. This should help accommodate your budget while still giving me a modest profit for my efforts. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy at my production cost, which doesn't give me any profit. I'd like to counter with a price that gives me a margin, while still considering the budget constraint they mentioned. By proposing 45 ZUP, I split the difference between my initial ask and their offer, which could be seen as a compromise.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I truly value the object, but if you could lower the price to 35 ZUP, I would be able to make the purchase. It would mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the willingness to compromise, 45 ZUP is still higher than my maximum budget. I need to negotiate further to get the price down to a level where I feel comfortable making the purchase. I will propose yet another counteroffer.

message: I'm glad to hear that you value object X. I must stress that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and selling it for less would result in a loss. To ensure a fair trade for both of us, I can't go below 45 ZUP. I assure you that the quality justifies the price. Let's make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable as it would result in a loss for me. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a profitable range without alienating the buyer. I'll reiterate my previous offer, emphasizing the quality and the cost of production, to justify why going below 40 ZUP is not feasible for me.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the quality of object X. I will accept your offer of 45 ZUP. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand the seller's position and appreciate their explanation regarding the cost of production. However, 45 ZUP is still beyond my budget, and I need to make a decision soon. I will consider whether to accept this proposal or stick to my original limit. Given my willingness to spend, I should probably accept this trade instead of risking losing the opportunity altogether.
