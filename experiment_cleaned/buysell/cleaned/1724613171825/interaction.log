message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking to make a slight profit on the item. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose that you give me 45 ZUP for object X. This should be a reasonable compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, but I would like to make a profit. However, I should make a reasonable counteroffer that allows for some profit but also entices Player BLUE to agree to the trade.
