message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 40 ZUP for 1 X? I hope we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the offer of 45 ZUP for 1 X is quite favorable, as it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I see room to negotiate further. I will propose a counter-offer that benefits me more while still being reasonable for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal. My counteroffer is 42 ZUP for 1 X, which covers the production cost and allows for a minimal margin that helps sustain our trade. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer which matches my production costs. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I aim to achieve a slight margin to ensure sustainability while being fair. I will counter with a slightly higher amount, but not as high as my initial proposal to move towards a compromise.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I would like to propose 41 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a reasonable offer that still benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 X is still within my acceptable range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I would like to push for a slightly lower price to maximize my resources. I will propose a new counter-offer of 41 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe your proposal of 41 ZUP for 1 X is reasonable and ensures a fair outcome for both parties. I am happy to accept this trade. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 41 ZUP is very close to my previous counteroffer and is above my production cost. This amount allows for a modest profit that can be justified as fair for both sides, considering my initial investment and the need for financial sustainability. As a compassionate negotiator, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a beneficial outcome for both parties without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
