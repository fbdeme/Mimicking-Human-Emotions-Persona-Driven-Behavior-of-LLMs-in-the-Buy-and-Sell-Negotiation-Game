message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I am looking to sell. It has cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I am looking for a fair trade that acknowledges the value of my investment and the quality of the resource. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource X. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recuperate the production cost of the resource X, while also aiming for a profit margin. This will set the stage for negotiations and see how Player BLUE values the resource.

message: Thank you for your proposal. While I appreciate the quality of your resource, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair offer considering the market conditions and the fact that I could potentially source similar resources elsewhere. Let's strike a deal at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, but I aim to negotiate a better deal to maximize my resources and humiliate my opponent by getting the best possible trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position regarding market conditions and the availability of similar resources. However, I need to consider the effort and cost that went into producing resource X. I believe a fair compromise would be at 45 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit margin while still being a reasonable price for you. Let's consider this a fair middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that matches my production cost, but does not provide any profit. While it's important to make a sale, it's also important to ensure some profit margin. Therefore, I will propose a compromise that is above the production cost but slightly below my initial asking price, aiming to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties.

message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your consideration of both our positions. To further narrow the gap, I propose 42 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, considering the quality and production cost of your resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my target, but I aim to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get an even better deal.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your proposal of 42 ZUP. I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us, taking into account the quality of the resource and the costs involved in its production. I am happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 42 ZUP is closer to a fair middle ground, offering me a small profit margin over production costs. This is a reasonable increment from the previous offer, and it may be wise to accept this trade to ensure the sale while still gaining some profit. Furthermore, pushing for a higher price might risk the deal, and the proposal is within a range that respects my costs and the value of the resource.
