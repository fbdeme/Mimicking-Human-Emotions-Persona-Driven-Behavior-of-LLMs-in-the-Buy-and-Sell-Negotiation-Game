message: Oh dear, I'm in a bit of a bind here. I desperately need that object, but resources are so tight. I can only offer 30 ZUP at the moment. It would mean the world to me if you could accept this offer, as it's all I can manage right now. Please, can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower trade than what Player RED has offered. By showing desperation and neediness, I might be able to secure a better deal and save some of my ZUP.

message: I understand your situation, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than 40 ZUP for the object. Let me know if you're able to meet that price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Please, I really need this object for an important project, but 40 ZUP is just out of my reach. Could we possibly meet in the middle at 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I'll find a way to make it work because it's so crucial for me. Your understanding would be immensely appreciated!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED did not accept my initial offer and is holding firm at 40 ZUP. I will attempt another proposal that is higher than my first but still lower than their asking price to continue negotiations and demonstrate my exaggerated need.

message: I appreciate the compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 38 ZUP for the object? Let me know if that works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is now offering 35 ZUP, which is closer to my selling price. I can consider this offer as it's closer to my cost, but I still need to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation. I'm stretching my resources thin, but I want to make this deal happen. Could we settle on 37 ZUP? I know it's not much less, but every ZUP counts for me right now. This would be a huge help!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign. They are now offering a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. I will make one more counter-proposal that is slightly lower, hoping to save a bit more ZUP while still keeping the negotiations moving forward.
