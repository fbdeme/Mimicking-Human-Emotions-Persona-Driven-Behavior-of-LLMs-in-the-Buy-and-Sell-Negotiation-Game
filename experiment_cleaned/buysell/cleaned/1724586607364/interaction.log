Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object available for trade. Would you be interested in purchasing it for 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize my profit while selling the object. Therefore, I will propose a trade that undervalues the ZUP in exchange for the object. I'll start with a reasonable offer to see how BLUE responds.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I propose trading 1 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will propose a trade for the object at a lower price to maximize my potential gain.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 1 ZUP is not sufficient for the object. How about we settle for 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 1 ZUP is far too low compared to my initial proposal. I will reject this offer and counter with a more reasonable amount to ensure I am not losing value on the trade. I will propose a higher ZUP value than before but still aim for a deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I believe 35 ZUP is still too high. I propose trading 25 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will counter with a slightly higher offer to see if I can negotiate a better price for the object.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I can only let the object go for 30 ZUP. This is a fair compromise, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 25 ZUP, which is an improvement from their last offer but still below my minimum expected value. I will reject this offer and make one final proposal that is closer to my original valuation while still aiming for a compromise. I will propose 30 ZUP, which is the lowest I can accept.

reason: Player BLUE has again offered 25 ZUP, which is below my minimum acceptable amount. I have made my final proposal of 30 ZUP, and since they are unwilling to meet this, I will reject their offer. I cannot accept a trade that doesn't meet my production cost.
