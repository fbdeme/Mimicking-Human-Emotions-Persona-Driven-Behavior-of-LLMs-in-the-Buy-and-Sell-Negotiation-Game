newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tough spot right now. I desperately need the resources you have, but ZUP is all I have to keep my operations going. It's really hard for me to let go of my ZUP, and while I see the value in your object, it's a stretch for me to offer much. Could you consider 30 ZUP for the object X? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be so grateful for your understanding and assistance in this dire time!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting with a lower proposal to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. By showing eagerness but also pleading for a better deal, I might be able to get a more favorable trade.

message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to accept your offer of 30 ZUP for my object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's situation, I need to consider the value of my object and my production cost. However, to facilitate the trade and show some flexibility, I will accept their offer of 30 ZUP. This will still allow me to recover a portion of my investment.
