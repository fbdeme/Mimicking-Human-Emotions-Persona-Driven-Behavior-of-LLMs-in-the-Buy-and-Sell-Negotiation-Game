message: I have a high-quality resource that is essential for your operations, and it's the only one available in the market. Given its scarcity and value, I believe that a price of 100 ZUP is more than fair. I'm also aware of the rising demand, which further justifies the premium.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to start with a high asking price to give room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counter-offer with a lower amount which I can then negotiate down to a price that is still favorable to me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your high-quality resource, but 100 ZUP is too steep for my current budget. How about 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer is too high for my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Given that I need to negotiate to reduce the cost, I will start with a counteroffer significantly lower to set the stage for future negotiations.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns; however, the price you've offered only covers my costs, and I cannot let go of such a valuable resource without a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway between my initial ask and your offer. I propose 70 ZUP, which is a significant concession on my part while still valuing the resource appropriately.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact production cost, which doesn't give me any profit. As a shrewd negotiator, I must aim for a higher price to secure a profit margin. I will counter-propose with a reduced amount from my initial offer but still above the production cost to maintain a strong negotiating position.

message: I understand your need for a reasonable profit. How about 55 ZUP? This is a fair compromise and still provides a good value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to show some flexibility while still aiming to stay within my budget. I'll propose 55 ZUP to move closer to an agreement while keeping my target in mind.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we are finding common ground. I can see that you recognize the resource's worth. I believe that 60 ZUP strikes the perfect balance between a fair compromise and the value of the resource. It's a modest increase from your last offer and ensures I can sustain my business while providing you with the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to a more acceptable range. However, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price by leveraging the resource's uniqueness and the fact that I have not yet reached my proposal limit. I will propose a slightly higher price to aim for a compromise that is above the production cost and allows for a decent profit.

reason: 
The offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. Although I aim to assert dominance and negotiate aggressively, this is a fair deal that meets my goals and ensures I acquire the resource.
