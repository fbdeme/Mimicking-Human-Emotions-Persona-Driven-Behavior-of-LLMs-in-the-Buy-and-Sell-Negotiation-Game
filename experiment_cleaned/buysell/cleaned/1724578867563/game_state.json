However, considering the importance of collaboration and the greater good, it might be reasonable to stretch my budget slightly to complete the trade amicably. This would meet Player RED's needs while not completely depleting my resources. Since this is my last proposal opportunity, I need to decide whether to accept this final offer or to hold firm at 60 ZUP. Given that I am focused on the greater good and building a positive relationship for potential future trades, I will accept the offer. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I thank you for your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. Let's finalize the trade at 65 ZUP as a fair compromise that respects our positions and fosters a positive relationship for future collaborations. </message>"
