message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a small profit. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for  ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and aims for a small profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP. This gives me a 10 ZUP profit while being reasonable.
