message: Thank you for your consideration. Could we meet halfway between our last two offers? How about 36 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has decreased their asking price, which shows willingness to negotiate. I still want to push for a better deal closer to my initial counteroffer yet remain within a reasonable range. I'll propose a price between my initial counteroffer and their counteroffer to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to meet at your price of 38 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the price of 38 ZUP. Since it is still well within my budget and only slightly higher than my last offer, accepting this would secure the resource without exhausting the negotiation process and still achieving my goal below the maximum willingness to pay.
