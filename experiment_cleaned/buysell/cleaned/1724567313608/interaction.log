message: Thank you for your offer. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we settle at 35 ZUP? This way, we both make a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. To strike a balance, I propose 32 ZUP for the X resource. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget, but I aim to maximize my savings. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can secure the resource for less.
