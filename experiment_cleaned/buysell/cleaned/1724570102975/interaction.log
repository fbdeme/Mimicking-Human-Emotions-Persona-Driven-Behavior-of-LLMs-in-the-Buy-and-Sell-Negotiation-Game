message: Let's start the negotiation. I propose to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a price that covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. I believe this will set a fair baseline for our discussion.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my budget since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. The object X seems valuable enough to justify this cost. I will propose a slight counter-offer to negotiate a better deal for myself while still ensuring the trade can go through.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This way, I can cover my production cost and have a small profit, and you get the resource at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP only covers my production cost without any profit. Since I value collaboration and mutual benefit, I will propose a middle ground to ensure both parties are satisfied.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility! I would like to propose a trade for 42 ZUP instead. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is still acceptable to me since it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate further to aim for a lower price. I will propose 42 ZUP as a counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your flexibility as well! Yes, 42 ZUP works for me. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my minimum acceptable price. Given that my goal is to foster collaboration and ensure mutual benefit, I am inclined to accept this slightly lower price to finalize the deal.
