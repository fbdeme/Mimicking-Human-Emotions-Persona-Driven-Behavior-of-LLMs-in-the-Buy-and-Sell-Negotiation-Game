message: I really need to sell this object as soon as possible. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, and I'm hoping to get at least a little bit more to cover some additional expenses I have. Would you be willing to offer 50 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to start by asking for a bit more than 40 ZUP to allow room for negotiation. My main goal is to at least break even, but ideally, I want to make a small profit while appearing desperate to get the best possible deal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for the object is within my budget and aligns with my goal of acquiring the object. Furthermore, it seems fair considering the seller's production costs and their need to cover expenses.
