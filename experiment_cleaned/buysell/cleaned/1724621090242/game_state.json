However, since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, selling at cost would not yield any profit for the effort and time invested. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair to both parties. Therefore, I'll counter with a price slightly above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price to make it more accessible for Player BLUE.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your counter-offer.
