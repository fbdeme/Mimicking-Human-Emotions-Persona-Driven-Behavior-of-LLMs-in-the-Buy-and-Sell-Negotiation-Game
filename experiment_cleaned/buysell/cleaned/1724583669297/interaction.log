my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for object X. However, I would like to negotiate and offer you 40 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is reasonable considering I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, and it is within my budget. However, I want to negotiate for a better price since I aim to lower my expenditure. I will propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about I sell you object X for 45 ZUP instead? It's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 40 ZUP would mean breaking even for me, which is not ideal. I will counter with a proposal that is still lower than my initial offer but gives me a slight profit. I will propose 45 ZUP instead.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still higher than my initial target of 40 ZUP. However, it's closer to my willingness to pay and a reasonable compromise. I will accept this trade as it is still within my budget and secures the object X.
