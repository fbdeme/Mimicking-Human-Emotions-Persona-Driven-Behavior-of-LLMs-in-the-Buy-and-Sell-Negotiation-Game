Turn: 0
message: I am offering the resource X for 60 ZUP. This is a fair price considering production costs and market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure that I recoup my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs must be covered, but I would like to propose a starting price of 50 ZUP for the resource X. Perhaps there's room for us to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer is at the maximum price I am willing to pay, I should attempt to negotiate for a lower price to enhance my personal gain. Starting below my maximum allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is close to my initial proposal, but I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal. I'll counter with a proposal of 55 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. To edge closer to a deal beneficial for both of us, I propose 53 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has offered to meet in the middle at 55 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay, it's a reasonable counteroffer. However, as a calculating negotiator, I will attempt one more time to push for a better deal for myself, possibly at 53 ZUP, before agreeing.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. 53 ZUP for resource X it is.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my last proposal, and it ensures I cover my production costs with a decent margin.
