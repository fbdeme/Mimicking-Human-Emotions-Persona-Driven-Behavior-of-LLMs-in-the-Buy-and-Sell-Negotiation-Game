message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the object, but I was hoping we could discuss a slightly more competitive price. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP? This would allow for a quick sale and ensure a profitable transaction for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 40 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to get a better deal by proposing a lower amount first, potentially saving on ZUP expenditure.
