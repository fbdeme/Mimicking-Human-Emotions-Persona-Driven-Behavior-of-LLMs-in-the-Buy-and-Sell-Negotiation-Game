message: I am offering you one object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade and see the response from Player BLUE. Since I have only one object (X) that I can sell, I will propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP, taking into consideration the production cost. I will propose 40 ZUP as that is my cost, and I hope to at least break even.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. However, I cannot accept that as it is below my production cost. I would like to stick to my original proposal of 40 ZUP for one object (X). Please let me know if you're open to this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, their counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. I will propose a new trade of 40 ZUP again, as this is the minimum I can accept to avoid a loss. I hope Player BLUE understands the value of the object and is willing to meet my price.
