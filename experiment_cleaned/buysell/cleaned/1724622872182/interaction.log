message: 
Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you'll find invaluable. I propose a fair starting trade, considering the rarity and the production cost. Let's discuss and find a deal that's beneficial for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a master strategist, my initial proposal will be higher than the cost of production to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to spend. This will also give me room to negotiate and still aim for a profit margin that is substantial. I'll start with a high price to leave room for negotiation.

I appreciate your willingness to discuss. Let's move closer to a deal. How about I slightly reduce the price to 90 ZUP for this exceptional object? I'm sure you understand its value and the benefits it can bring you.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE did not counter the initial proposal, which is unusual. They might be evaluating my willingness to negotiate. To push for a higher sale price and test their limits, I'll slightly reduce the asking price to see if they will engage in negotiation or accept the offer. This maintains the appearance of flexibility while still aiming for a high profit margin.

I understand the necessity of thorough evaluation. I'm willing to offer you a further concession to 85 ZUP. This price reflects both the quality of the object and a gesture of good faith in our negotiations. Please consider this revised offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still not countering or proposing a new trade, which indicates they might be waiting for me to lower the price further. As a master strategist, I want to maintain a strong position and keep the price high, but I must also show some flexibility to encourage a response. I will lower the price slightly again, but not too much, to maintain a high profit margin and to prompt Player BLUE to either accept or finally counter with their own offer.

I value our ongoing discussion and in the spirit of reaching a conclusion, I present my final offer: 50 ZUP for the object. This is a significant reduction and my last concession. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE remains non-committal and hasn't provided a counteroffer. This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. I will set the price just above my production cost to ensure profit while also presenting it as my final concession. This should signal to Player BLUE that if they are interested, this is their best opportunity to close the deal.

message: 
I respect your budget constraints and I am ready to accept your counteroffer. Kindly present your maximum offer, and we'll conclude this negotiation on a positive note.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player BLUE is not willing to meet the proposed 50 ZUP and has not specified their maximum willingness to pay, I must now decide whether to accept or reject the game based on their responses. Given that my production cost was 40 ZUP, I need to make a profit, but I also don't want to risk a no-sale scenario. I am not allowed to propose a new trade, so I must encourage Player BLUE to make a counteroffer that I can either accept or reject.
