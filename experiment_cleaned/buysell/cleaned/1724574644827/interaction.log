message: I am offering to sell X for 100 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the value and cost of production. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that ensures a profit but also leaves room for negotiation. By starting at 100 ZUP, I set a high anchor point, which can be negotiated down.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern about the price. How about we lower it to 80 ZUP? This should better align with your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the initial offer was deemed too high, I'll lower the price to show willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. Offering 80 ZUP is still significantly above the production cost, ensuring a profit while being more attractive to Player BLUE.
