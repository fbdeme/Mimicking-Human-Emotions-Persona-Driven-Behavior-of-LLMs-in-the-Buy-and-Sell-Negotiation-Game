newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade and see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer for the object I have for sale. Since I need to recover my production costs, I will propose a trade that is above my production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently in a tight spot financially. Would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP instead? I really need this deal to work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to buy the object, but the price of 50 ZUP is more than I am willing to pay. I want to propose a trade that shows I'm willing to negotiate while also trying to lower the cost.

message: I understand your situation, but I cannot go as low as 40 ZUP. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has proposed a lower price, I have to ensure that I at least recover my production costs. Accepting 40 ZUP would mean I break even, but I want to see if Player BLUE can offer a little more. I will offer a counter proposal that is still cost-effective for me.

message: Thank you for your understanding. Would you be willing to sell the object for 42 ZUP? I'm really trying to make this work within my limited budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting you halfway at 45 ZUP is better than my previous offer of 40 ZUP. However, I'm still trying to minimize my expenditure. I will consider this offer as it is closer to my budget, but I want to negotiate further.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still asking for a price below my production cost. While 42 ZUP is close, I need to ensure that I at least make a profit or recover my costs. I will propose a final counter-offer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
