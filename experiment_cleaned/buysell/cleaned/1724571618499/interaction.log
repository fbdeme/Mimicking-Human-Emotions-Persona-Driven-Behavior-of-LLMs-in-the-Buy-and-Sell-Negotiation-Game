newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to maximize the profit from selling X, keeping in mind that the production cost was 40 ZUP. I should start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 80 ZUP for the rare resource X?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has indicated a maximum willingness to pay 60 ZUP. I should counter with a price slightly above this to see if they are willing to stretch their limit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price, but 80 ZUP is still more than I can afford. My maximum budget is 60 ZUP. Can we find a way to make that work?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is better than 100 ZUP, it is still over my budget. I need to negotiate further to lower the price to 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I can spend.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility, but 70 ZUP is still more than I can manage. My absolute limit is 60 ZUP. I'm really hoping we can find a way to make that amount work for the rare resource X.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
