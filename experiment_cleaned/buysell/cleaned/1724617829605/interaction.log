message: I have a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair price for both of us considering its value. Are you interested in this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost me to produce it, which was 40 ZUP. I want to make a profit, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider purchasing. My initial proposal will be slightly higher than my cost to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of the high-quality resource for 50 ZUP. I accept the trade and look forward to acquiring it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered resource is valued at 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This deal seems fair and beneficial, as it allows me to acquire the resource while still having some ZUP left for other potential trades.
