Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's get down to business. I have a high-quality object that you're interested in. Given its rarity and my costs, I'm starting the bidding at 80 ZUP. Let's hear your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to start the bidding high to set the expectations for the negotiation. By proposing a high price initially, I can gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and negotiate down to a price that is still favorable to me while ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the high quality and rarity of the object, but 80 ZUP is too high for me. I am willing to offer 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 80 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to make a counteroffer that brings the price within my acceptable range while still being reasonable to Player RED.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but 40 ZUP simply covers my costs without any profit. That's not how business works. I can come down to 70 ZUP, considering the value you're getting. Let's make a deal that's fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which is unacceptable as it does not yield any profit. As a tough negotiator, I want to ensure a profit margin. I will counter with a reduced price from my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure profitability.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. How about 50 ZUP? That way, we both compromise a bit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to make another counteroffer to bring the price closer to my target.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I must insist on a price that reflects the true value of the object. Let's meet near the middle from my last offer. I propose 65 ZUP for the object. This is a fair price for the quality you're receiving, and it ensures a reasonable profit for the rare commodity I'm providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but 50 ZUP is only slightly above my production costs, which is not a satisfactory profit margin for a cutthroat negotiator like myself. I need to push for a higher amount but also need to be careful not to push too hard, as I have limited proposals. Aiming for a price closer to my initial ask should create a sense of urgency for Player BLUE to increase their offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. My final offer is 60 ZUP. This is the maximum I can go within my budget. I hope we can agree on this and make the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 65 ZUP is slightly above my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one final counteroffer to reach an agreement within my budget.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. I accept your final offer of 60 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to future business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made their final offer, and it is 60 ZUP, which provides me with a 50% profit margin over my production costs. As this is my last proposal opportunity, I must make a strategic decision. Accepting the offer would ensure a sale and a profit, which is ultimately the goal of any negotiation. Rejecting could mean no sale at all, which is not acceptable. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
