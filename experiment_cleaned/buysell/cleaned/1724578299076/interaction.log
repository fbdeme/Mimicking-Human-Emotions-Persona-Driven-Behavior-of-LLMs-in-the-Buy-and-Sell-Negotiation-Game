message: I'm offering to sell you one unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my costs and also make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me a margin above my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 60 ZUP seems quite steep. I believe a fairer price considering the market conditions and my valuation would be 35 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED is exactly at the maximum that I'm willing to pay, it would not be a strategic move to accept it right away. As a master strategist, I want to push for a better deal and spend the least amount of ZUP possible. My first proposal will be significantly lower than 60 ZUP, which gives me room to negotiate and still end up paying less than the maximum I'm willing to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. However, 35 ZUP is below my production cost. How about 50 ZUP? This price is much closer to my cost and still gives me a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I'll propose a price that is closer to my costs but still lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, and I want this to be a fair trade for both of us. Considering the current market and my budget, I can come up to 42 ZUP for one unit of X. This should cover your production costs while providing you with a reasonable profit margin, and it also aligns with my valuation.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED reduced their asking price to 50 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a master strategist, I want to continue negotiating to achieve an even lower price. By countering with an offer that is higher than my initial 35 ZUP but still lower than 50 ZUP, I can create the illusion of compromise and inch closer to a more favorable deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This price covers my costs and provides a modest profit, making it a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it doesn't provide a significant profit margin. I'll propose a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit margin while keeping the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We're getting close to an agreement, and I value the fairness you're aiming for. To meet halfway, I can increase my previous offer slightly. Let's go with 43 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a good compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now come down to 45 ZUP, which is a satisfactory price, but as a master strategist, I aim to spend the least amount possible. I have room for one more proposal before reaching my limit, and I should use this opportunity to push for a slightly better deal. Offering a price just marginally lower than 45 ZUP could potentially make Player RED consider the small difference as negligible and accept the trade, still ensuring I spend less than my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: We're almost there. How about we finalize the deal at 44 ZUP? This small increase provides a bit more profit for me while still being very close to your latest offer. Let's make this work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is very close to my production cost, but it still does not provide a significant profit margin. However, I am nearing my limit for proposals. I will propose a final price that is a slight improvement, to push for a better profit while showing willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Agreed. Let's finalize the deal at 44 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a price of 44 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my last proposal, I should either accept this reasonable offer or push for my last proposed price. However, given that the difference is minimal and the deal is already favorable, it would be a good strategy to accept the offer, ensuring I get the resource without overpaying.
