Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking along the lines of 15 ZUP for your object X. It's a competitive bid and ensures a quick sale for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 20 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I'll attempt to get a better deal by proposing a lower amount first, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your offer of 15 ZUP, but I am looking for a higher return on my object. Let's see if we can meet somewhere more favorable for me.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 15 ZUP is lower than my original asking price, it would still result in a loss for me. I believe I can negotiate for a better price, so I will reject this offer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED rejected my first counteroffer but seems open to continuing the negotiation. I will increase my offer slightly to show goodwill and keep the negotiation moving forward, but I will still aim to keep the price well below my maximum willingness to pay.
