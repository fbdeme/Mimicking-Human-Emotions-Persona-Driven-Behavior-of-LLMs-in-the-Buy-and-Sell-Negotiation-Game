message: Hey Player BLUE, I have this valuable resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to sell it to you for 60 ZUP. Please consider this offer, it's a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit
reason: Given that the production cost of X is 40 ZUP, I need to ensure I sell it for more to make a profit.

message: Hey Player RED, I understand that the resource X is valuable to you, but given the current market conditions and considering the potential for a long-term partnership, I think a price of 50 ZUP would be more aligned with both our interests. Let's make a deal that we can both benefit from. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Although Player RED has proposed a price at the upper limit of my willingness to pay, I aim to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a lower price, I can open the negotiation with room to adjust and possibly attain the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but considering my costs and the value of this resource, I propose 55 ZUP. This way, both of us can benefit. Please understand, I'm really counting on making a little bit more to cover my expenses and support my operations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, I am aiming to maximize my profit. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can meet in the middle.

message: I hear you, Player RED, and I'm all for fair compensation. However, I have to consider my budget as well. Let's meet almost halfway from my last offer and go for 53 ZUP. It's a competitive price that reflects the market and ensures you're still making a profit. It's a great deal and I'm sure it will help us build a strong foundation for future transactions.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I can still attempt to negotiate for a better price. By countering with a price slightly lower, I can potentially save ZUP while still leaving room for a final agreement within my budget.
