message: I am offering to sell you one unit of X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I have one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP. This sets the expectation that I value the object at its production cost.

message: I'm interested in the resource, but I was thinking more in the range of 30 ZUP. Would you consider that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has offered, aiming to save ZUP while reaching an agreement. My initial offer will be significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for negotiation.

message: How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? I think thatâ€™s a fair compromise. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since I want to make the trade and possibly build a relationship for future trades, I will propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP. This keeps me from losing too much ZUP while still being reasonable.

message: 35 ZUP is moving in the right direction, but I'd like to propose 32 ZUP. I believe this is still a good deal for both of us. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will attempt another negotiation step to get a better deal, without reaching my maximum limit too soon.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it's closer to my expectations than the initial offer of 30 ZUP. To complete the trade and avoid losing the opportunity, I will accept this trade. I will also consider it a win, as it is better than not selling at all.
