player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting the negotiation by offering 40 ZUP for the object, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and possible counter-offers, allowing me to potentially secure the object for less than the maximum I am willing to spend.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment. I understand the need for ZUP, and I'm glad we can work together on this. Let's finalize at 35 ZUP and call it a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer is lower than my initial proposal, which is favorable for me. They've moved from 40 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the object for a better price than my opening offer. However, since I'm a shrewd negotiator, I'll attempt to see if there's room to get an even better deal without pushing too hard, which could risk the trade.

message: It's a deal at 30 ZUP. I'm grateful for your cooperation and flexibility. Thank you for finalizing this trade with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an even more favorable counter-offer of 30 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This is a great opportunity to capitalize on my negotiation strategy and secure the object at a much lower cost than I was prepared for. Accepting this offer would be advantageous and aligns with my goal to minimize ZUP expenditure.
