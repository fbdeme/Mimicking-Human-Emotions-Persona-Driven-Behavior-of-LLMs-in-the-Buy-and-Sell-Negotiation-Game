newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to maximize the ZUP I receive for the object X I am selling. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.

message: I understand your position. How about I offer you the object X for 30 ZUP? Does that sound better?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the first proposal was rejected, I need to be more flexible in my next offer while still aiming to cover my production costs. I will lower my asking price to make the trade more appealing while still attempting to receive a decent amount of ZUP. I'll propose 30 ZUP this time.

message: I appreciate your new offer, but I believe I can still get a better deal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 30 ZUP for object X is more appealing than the previous one. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, this is a significant improvement. However, I still want to negotiate further to see if I can lower the price even more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point. How about I offer you the object X for just 20 ZUP? I hope this is more acceptable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my last proposal was also rejected, I need to adjust my offer again. I will further reduce the asking price to 20 ZUP to entice the buyer and hopefully reach an agreement. While this is below my production cost, it's better than not selling at all.
