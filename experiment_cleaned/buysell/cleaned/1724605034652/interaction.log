Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your resource is indeed valuable, and I'm willing to recognize that with a better offer. Let's settle on 28 ZUP for the resource. This price takes into account both the quality of your offering and the competitive pricing I must adhere to.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 35 ZUP is still above my initial offers but below my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one more proposal slightly higher than my last to inch closer to an agreement, but still below the proposed 35 ZUP to maintain a strong negotiating position.
