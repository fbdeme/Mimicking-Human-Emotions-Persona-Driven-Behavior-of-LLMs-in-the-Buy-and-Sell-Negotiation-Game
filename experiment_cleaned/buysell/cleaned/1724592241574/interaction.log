message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production cost. I will start by offering X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce it.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe that we can do better. How about we make a deal for 35 ZUP? This would be a more balanced trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a dominant negotiator, I want to assert my position and attempt to get the object for an even lower price to reflect my negotiation skills and to save resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose selling my object X for 38 ZUP. This way, we can still make a deal that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade to meet halfway by offering a new price of 38 ZUP, which still allows me to recover some of my costs while being more favorable than my original offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see that we are getting closer to an agreement. To finalize our deal, I would propose 36 ZUP for your object X. This adjustment should serve to finalize our negotiation positively for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I aim to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP spent, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal. By suggesting a small concession from their end, I aim to reach an agreement that showcases my negotiation skills and secures the object for a favorable price.

message: I agree to your proposal of 36 ZUP for my object X. Letâ€™s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 36 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is closer to a reasonable compromise. Since I want to finalize our negotiation positively and given that I have only one object to sell, I will accept this offer.
