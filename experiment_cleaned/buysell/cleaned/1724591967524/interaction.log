my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-offer slightly increases the amount of ZUP offered for the resource which shows willingness to negotiate and might encourage Player RED to consider the trade more seriously. However, it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, preserving my negotiating space for future proposals if necessary.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

I want to convey eagerness to conclude the deal without appearing desperate or too accommodating, which might lead to a less favorable outcome.
