player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a strategic negotiator, I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED will accept a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but the cost of production is 40 ZUP, so I can't go lower than 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The cost of production is 40 ZUP, so selling for 30 ZUP would result in a loss. I'll have to counter with a higher price.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the cost constraints. How about we settle at 33 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my budget, and it is only slightly higher than my previous offer. As a strategic negotiator, I will try to propose a slightly lower amount to ensure the best deal but respecting the production cost constraint mentioned.

my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
