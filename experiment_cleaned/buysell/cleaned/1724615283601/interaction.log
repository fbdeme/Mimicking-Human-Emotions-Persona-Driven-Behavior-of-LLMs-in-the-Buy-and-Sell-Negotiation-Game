message: I understand the importance of sustainability in our negotiations. I've proposed a trade that covers my costs while considering your position. Looking forward to finding a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to make a proposal that covers my production costs but also takes into consideration the well-being of Player BLUE. I will propose a starting trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to find a fair middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but I believe we can negotiate a better price for the object. Let's work towards finding a more favorable agreement.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is for 1 object in exchange for 45 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, this offer is within my budget. However, I would like to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my resources.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has rejected the initial proposal, indicating a desire for a better price. As I want to ensure a fair deal that is also compassionate towards Player BLUE's situation, I will lower my asking price to slightly above my production cost to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.
