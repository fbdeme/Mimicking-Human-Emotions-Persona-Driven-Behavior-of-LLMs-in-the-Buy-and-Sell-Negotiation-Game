message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand that you are interested in acquiring the object X. I have taken into account the production cost and would like to propose a fair trade that benefits us both. I offer you X in exchange for 45 ZUP, which is just a bit more than what it cost to produce. This ensures that we both walk away satisfied from the deal. I am open to negotiation if you have a counteroffer. Let's work together for the greater good!
