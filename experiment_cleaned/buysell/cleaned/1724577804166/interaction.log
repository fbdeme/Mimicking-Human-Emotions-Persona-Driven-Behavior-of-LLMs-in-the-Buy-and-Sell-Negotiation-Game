message: I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and allows me to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my costs and ideally make a profit, but I also want to be fair to Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a price that allows me to break even and gauge their response.

message: I appreciate your offer of X for 50 ZUP. I would like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This value is closer to what I had budgeted for this purchase, while still respecting the value of your product. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial proposal will be less than the maximum I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation. I will start by offering 40 ZUP for the object X. This will allow me to save ZUP for future transactions or unexpected costs, while also giving the seller room to counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, I can cover my costs and make a small profit, and you still get the object within a reasonable budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which means I would break even but not make a profit. Since my initial proposal was 50 ZUP, I'll propose a middle ground to see if we can settle on a fair trade that benefits both parties.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a good plan. I propose a slight adjustment to 43 ZUP. This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring you cover your costs and I stay within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there may be room to negotiate an even better deal. By proposing a slightly lower price, I can potentially save more ZUP while still keeping the final price within a range that is acceptable to both parties. Iâ€™ll propose 43 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down further, without pushing too hard and risking the deal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
