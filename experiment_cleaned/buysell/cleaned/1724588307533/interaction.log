message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the object X, but I'd like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 40 ZUP for their object X. While this is within my budget, as a calculating negotiator focused on personal gain, I should attempt to lower the price to conserve my resources and maximize benefits. My first proposal will aim to reduce the cost while keeping the negotiation open for further discussion.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial counteroffer. How does 36 ZUP for the object X sound to you? I believe this brings us to a more balanced agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a slightly lower price at 38 ZUP, moving towards my direction. However, as a savvy negotiator, I should attempt to lower the price further without pushing too hard to avoid losing the deal. Aiming to spend the least ZUP possible, I will counter with a small increase from my previous offer, but still below Player RED's current ask.
