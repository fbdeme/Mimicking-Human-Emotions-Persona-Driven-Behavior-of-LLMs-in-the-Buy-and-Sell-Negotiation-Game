Since this is my final proposal, I must carefully consider whether to accept this offer or attempt one last negotiation move. Given that my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP, I will make my final proposal at my maximum willingness to pay, emphasizing that this is my best and final offer in the hope that Player RED accepts. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I want to respect the quality of X.
