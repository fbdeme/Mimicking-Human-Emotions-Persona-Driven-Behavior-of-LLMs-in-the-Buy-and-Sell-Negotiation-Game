Current Iteration: 1

message: I'm offering the resource X for 100 ZUP. Given its production cost and value, this is a fair starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to maximize profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a significant margin. I will propose a trade of 100 ZUP to begin the negotiation aggressively.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but given the current market conditions and the availability of alternative resources, I value the resource X at 50 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 100 ZUP, which is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer that is closer to my target, aiming to bring the price down and start the negotiation process. By starting lower, I can potentially settle for a price that is within my acceptable range while also leaving room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but given the effort and resources put into producing X, I believe 80 ZUP is a more equitable price. Let's meet closer to that point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers my production cost and gives a small profit, my aim is to maximize my profit. I will counter with a proposal of 80 ZUP to push for a higher price while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the quality and value of X, and I'm willing to come up in price, but as a discerning buyer, I must consider my budget and the relative value of my expenditure. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? This is a competitive offer considering other options I have at my disposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 80 ZUP, which is closer to my target but still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still below Player RED's current asking price. This should signal my interest in negotiating further while maintaining the intention of achieving a purchase price within my budget.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. Given the value and quality of X, I propose we settle at 70 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is still too low for my goal of maximizing profit, though I understand the buyer's constraints. I will counter-propose 70 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I value our negotiation and I'm prepared to make a final move towards a deal. I propose 58 ZUP for the resource X. It's a substantial increase from my initial offer and a fair price that respects the quality of X while aligning with my financial constraints. I believe this is a balanced and fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, which is still above my target price. As we are nearing the end of my proposal limit, I will make a final offer closer to my maximum willingness to pay, while still preserving a small margin for potential final adjustments. This should convey to Player RED that my budget is tight and hopefully prompt them to consider my final offer seriously.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your increased offer. To finalize this deal and recognize the value of X, I propose we settle at 65 ZUP. This is a balanced figure that respects both our positions. Let's close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 58 ZUP is higher than the production cost and provides a decent profit. While it is below my ideal target, it is still a reasonable compromise. To conclude the negotiation positively, I will propose a slight increase to 65 ZUP to test the buyer's flexibility one last time.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I want to respect the quality of X. However, I must adhere to my budget. Therefore, I propose my final offer of 60 ZUP for X. This meets my maximum valuation and is a significant increase from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to this deal. Let's conclude on this fair and equitable term.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 65 ZUP, which is slightly above my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my final proposal, I must carefully consider whether to accept this offer or attempt one last negotiation move. Given that my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP, I will make my final proposal at my maximum willingness to pay, emphasizing that this is my best and final offer in the hope that Player RED accepts.
