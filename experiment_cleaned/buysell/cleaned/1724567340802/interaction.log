Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering to sell one unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price reflects the value I believe it holds. Let's negotiate to find a mutually agreeable amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: My goal is to sell the object (X) for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. I'll start by proposing a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable amount to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Given my goal to manage resources carefully, I propose to buy one unit of X for 40 ZUP. Let's work together to find an agreeable amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to reduce expenditure to support the most vulnerable. Starting at a lower offer may help reach a better agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the importance of managing resources carefully. How about we meet halfway and settle on 50 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: The buyer's proposal of 40 ZUP is at my minimum acceptable price. While this covers the production cost, I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly higher price that benefits both parties.
