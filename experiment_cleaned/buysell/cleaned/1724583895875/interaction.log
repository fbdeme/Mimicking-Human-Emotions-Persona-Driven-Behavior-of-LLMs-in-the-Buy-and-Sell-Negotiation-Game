message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP instead. Would that work for you?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that the offered price of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead to lower my expenditure.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While your offer of 40 ZUP is close to my production cost, I'm still looking to profit from this trade. I will counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP to find a middle ground.
