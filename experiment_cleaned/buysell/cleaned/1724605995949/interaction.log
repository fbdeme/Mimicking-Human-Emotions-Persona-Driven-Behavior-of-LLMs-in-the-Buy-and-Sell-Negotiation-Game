message: 40 ZUP seems a bit steep for just one object. How about we start at 20 ZUP and go from there?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a proposal that is well below my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to spend as little as possible.

message: I understand your point. Let's start at 20 ZUP and we can negotiate from there.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 20 ZUP. It's a significant decrease, but I will consider it to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're on the same page with starting the negotiations at a lower point. Still, for an item like this, I think we could consider bringing the price down just a little bit more. How does 15 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although they've accepted the initial low offer, as a cutthroat negotiator, I should push to see if there's an opportunity to get an even better deal without immediately agreeing to the first proposal. This could help me save resources for future transactions.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at 17 ZUP. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting 15 ZUP, which is even lower. I need to consider whether this price is acceptable for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair, but I propose we do so at 16 ZUP instead. This should be a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 16
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should aim to secure the object for even less to maintain my aggressive negotiation stance. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer but still below their counteroffer to keep the negotiation in my favor.
