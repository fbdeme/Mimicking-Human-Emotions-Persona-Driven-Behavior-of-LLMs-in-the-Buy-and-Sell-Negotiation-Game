Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I am happy to accept the trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let's finalize the details.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to acquire the resources for 60 ZUP or less, the initial proposal of 40 ZUP is well within my budget. It shows good faith and willingness to negotiate further, potentially even lowering the cost more if possible. It's important to consider the well-being of both parties, and starting the negotiation with a reasonable offer helps establish a positive relationship.
