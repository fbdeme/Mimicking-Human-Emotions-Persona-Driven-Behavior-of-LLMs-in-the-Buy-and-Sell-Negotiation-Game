my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently in a tight spot financially. Would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP instead? It would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to buy the object, but I want to negotiate the price down since I have a limited budget. I will propose a lower offer to see if RED is willing to accept less.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I am willing to lower the price to 45 ZUP. This way, I can cover my costs and still make a small profit. I hope this works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The proposed trade of 40 ZUP covers my production costs exactly but leaves no room for profit. Considering the financial situation of Player BLUE, I will propose a slight compromise to ensure both parties benefit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my situation! Would you be able to accept 43 ZUP for the object? I would greatly appreciate your understanding and flexibility.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has lowered the price to 45 ZUP, which is much closer to my budget. While it's still a bit more than I initially proposed, I see it as a fair compromise. I need the object and this price seems reasonable.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
