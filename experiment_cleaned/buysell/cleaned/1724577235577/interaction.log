message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the effort it took to produce the object X. In the spirit of collective success and to ensure we both benefit from this trade, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 35 ZUP. This ensures that we conserve resources for the community while still providing you with a return on your production costs. Let's work together towards a fair exchange.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources and the initial offer is 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP for the community while still making a fair offer that acknowledges the cost of production for Player RED.
