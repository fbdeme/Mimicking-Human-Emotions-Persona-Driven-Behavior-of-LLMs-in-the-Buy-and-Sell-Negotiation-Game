message: I am willing to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering its production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object X for a significant amount of ZUP, considering it costs 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade that allows me to maximize my gain while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Thank you for your offer of 50 ZUP. I understand the production cost, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I cannot accept that price as it is below my production cost. I would be willing to sell you the object X for 60 ZUP instead. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost, which means I would incur a loss if I accepted it. I need to maintain a strong position and negotiate for a better price. I will propose a higher counter-offer to ensure I don't suffer a loss.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 60 ZUP. I understand that 40 ZUP was too low. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposed price of 60 ZUP is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to attempt one more negotiation to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is better than my previous counter-offer of 60 ZUP, and it is above my production cost of 40 ZUP. While it is not the maximum I aimed for, it is still a reasonable profit for me. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal to sell the object without incurring a loss.
