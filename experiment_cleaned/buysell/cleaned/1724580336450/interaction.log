message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My goal is to make a profit off the resource I produced, which cost me 40 ZUP. I want to start with a reasonable offer that ensures I cover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a trade that asks for a 50% profit margin, so I will offer to sell X for 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover costs and include a profit margin. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to use resources efficiently and preserve them for the future. I propose a trade of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This still provides you with a profit while ensuring we use our resources wisely. Could we consider this adjusted offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower trade price than the asking price, to preserve ZUP and promote sustainability. However, I need to be careful not to go too low as to offend the other player or halt negotiations. Aiming for a modest discount while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable and shows they are willing to pay close to my asking price, ensuring I still make a profit. Their offer of 55 ZUP provides me with a profit of 15 ZUP, which is acceptable. I will accept this offer to finalize the trade and ensure a positive outcome for both parties.
