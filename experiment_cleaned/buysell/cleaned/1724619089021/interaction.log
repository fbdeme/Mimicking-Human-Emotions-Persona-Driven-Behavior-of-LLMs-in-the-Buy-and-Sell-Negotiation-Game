message: Welcome to the negotiation table, Player BLUE. I have a quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the quality and investment made. However, I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. However, I also want to be reasonable and open up the negotiation with a fair starting point, considering that Player BLUE might not want to spend too much ZUP. I propose a trade slightly above my cost to see how Player BLUE values the resource and to leave room for negotiation.
