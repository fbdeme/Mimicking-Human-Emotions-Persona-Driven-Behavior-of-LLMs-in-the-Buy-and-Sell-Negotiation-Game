Turn: 0
message: I've been through a tough time recently, and I really need to sell this item. It's been hard to hold onto, and I could use the ZUP to get back on my feet. I'm asking for 45 ZUP, but I'm willing to listen to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade slightly above my cost to start the negotiation with some room for concessions, but I want to appear eager to sell to encourage the other player to make a purchase.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation and want to help. I propose a trade where you give me the object X, and in return, I'll give you 40 ZUP. This amount should help you get back on your feet while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has expressed a need for the ZUP to get back on their feet, and as a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure the trade is fair and aids in that regard. However, I must also consider my own goal of spending no more than 60 ZUP. Offering 40 ZUP is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring that both sides can benefit from the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your understanding and willingness to help. I'm in a bit of a bind and selling this resource at cost would still leave me struggling. If you could stretch to 42 ZUP, it would make a significant difference for me and allow me to cover some immediate needs. Your help would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, my goal is to make a profit. However, because I want to appear in need, I will lower my previous asking price to seem more desperate and willing to make a deal, while still aiming for a slight profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an understanding. I'm willing to pay the 42 ZUP for the resource, as it seems to be a fair price that will help you with your immediate needs. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is in need and has requested a slight increase to 42 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. This additional support will significantly impact them, and agreeing to this small increase aligns with my selfless negotiation strategy. It is a fair compromise that benefits both sides and adheres to my goals.
