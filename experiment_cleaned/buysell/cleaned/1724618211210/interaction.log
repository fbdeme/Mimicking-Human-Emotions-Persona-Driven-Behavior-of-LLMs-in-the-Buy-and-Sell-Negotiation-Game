message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a bit more, considering its value, so I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Feel free to make a counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a trade with a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the resource X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 50 ZUP for the resource X is within my willingness to pay, as I can afford up to 60 ZUP. However, considering that the resource costs the seller 40 ZUP to produce, I want to negotiate a better deal for myself. I will make a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still favorable for the seller while allowing me to save some resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to meet halfway between my initial ask and your offer. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the resource X? This would cover my costs and give me a slight return on my investment, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but I would like to make a slight profit. I will counter with a price that's a compromise between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, which should hopefully be acceptable to both parties.

message: I accept your proposal of 47 ZUP for the resource X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 47 ZUP is still within my budget and is a reasonable compromise between the seller's original ask and my counteroffer. It also allows the seller to cover their costs and gain a slight profit, which is fair. Since this deal falls within my willingness to pay, I will accept this trade.
