my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a higher price to leave room for bargaining. Since it costed me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose to sell it for 100 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 100 ZUP is too high for me. I propose 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high and exceeds my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand 100 ZUP is too high for you. How about 80 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which means no profit. To make this trade worthwhile, I need to propose a higher price. I will propose 80 ZUP to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a lower price. However, 80 ZUP is still a bit high for me. How about 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to bring the price down to an acceptable level.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. How about we settle at 70 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is still close to my production cost, leaving very little profit margin. I will propose 70 ZUP as a compromise, which provides a reasonable profit while still being lower than my previous offer.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet at 60 ZUP for the object? This is my maximum budget.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. We are getting closer, but I need to make another counter-proposal to stay within my budget.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP provides a 20 ZUP profit, which is acceptable and close to my last proposal. Given that this is their maximum budget, it seems fair to accept this offer to close the deal.
