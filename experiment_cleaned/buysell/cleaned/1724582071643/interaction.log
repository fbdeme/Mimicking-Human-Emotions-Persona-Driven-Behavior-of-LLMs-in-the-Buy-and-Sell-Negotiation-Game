my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I have only one object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my costs.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose a compromise. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP? What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the negotiation, I cannot accept 30 ZUP since it doesn't cover my production cost. However, I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial proposal to find a middle ground. I will propose 35 ZUP to see if that is acceptable.
