message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I produced the object at a cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP to cover my costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for the object, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget, and it seems like a fair price for the object. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal to reduce the cost further.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can let the object go for 35 ZUP instead. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I want to negotiate further. I will counteroffer with a slightly better price than my initial offer, as it still allows me to recover some of my costs. I'll propose 35 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial 40 ZUP but still above my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. However, it's a reasonable price and still within my budget. I can choose to accept this trade as it is a fair compromise.
