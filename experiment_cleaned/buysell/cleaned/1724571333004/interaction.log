message: I am offering 1 unit of object X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing 80 ZUP. This gives me a good profit margin and allows room for negotiation if needed.
