message: Let's start the negotiation. I'm offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that gives me a profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade that ensures I gain a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is exactly what I am willing to pay. However, I want to assert dominance and see if I can get a better deal. I will propose an alternative trade with a lower ZUP to test RED's willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about meeting in the middle at 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP still provides a profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP, but I believe there's room for a bit more profit. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can agree on that.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, but how about we settle at 52 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is better than my previous counteroffer of 50 ZUP, but I still want to see if I can negotiate further down. I will counter this offer as well, aiming to lower the ZUP spent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. 1 unit of X for 52 ZUP it is.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest counteroffer of 52 ZUP still provides a profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP, but only slightly less than my previous proposal. This seems like a fair compromise.
