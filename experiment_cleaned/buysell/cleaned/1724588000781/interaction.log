my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, it is below my cost of production.

reason: Player RED has countered with their original price, showing a desire to close the deal at 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your revised offer of 37 ZUP. I value your effort to reach a fair agreement, but I must stick to my asking price of 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. Letâ€™s see if we can finalize this!
