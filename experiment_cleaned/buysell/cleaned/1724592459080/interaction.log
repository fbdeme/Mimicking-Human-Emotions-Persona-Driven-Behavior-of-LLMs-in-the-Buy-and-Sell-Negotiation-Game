message: I am offering to sell you the object for 50 ZUP. This is higher than my production cost, but I hope it will be acceptable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover the cost of producing the object while also making a profit. I will propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for a price that is closer to my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object. This is closer to my budget. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a crafty operator, I aim to spend less ZUP if possible. I will make a counteroffer for a lower amount to start the negotiation, hoping to find an agreeable price that is less than the initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. I will accept the trade for 45 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price, it still covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. Accepting this trade seems reasonable given the context of negotiation.
