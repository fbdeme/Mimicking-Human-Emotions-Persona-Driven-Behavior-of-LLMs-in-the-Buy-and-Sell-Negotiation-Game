message: I am offering you the object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose a trade that aims for a profit while being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will propose selling the object for 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for the object is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to ensure that I am making the best possible deal while also considering sustainability. I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can negotiate a better price without compromising on the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I would like to propose a final trade of 45 ZUP for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP is lower than my original asking price of 50 ZUP, I recognize that it is equivalent to the cost I incurred to produce the object. Accepting this trade would allow me to break even, so I will consider accepting the trade. However, I want to propose a final trade that gets me a little more value. I will offer the object for 45 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my initial goal of minimizing spending while still acquiring the object. I see this as a fair compromise, allowing me to conserve some ZUP for future needs. Accepting this trade aligns with my sustainability goals.
