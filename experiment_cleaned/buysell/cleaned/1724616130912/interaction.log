message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you will find invaluable. Considering its exceptional worth and the cost of production, I believe a fair starting point for our negotiation is 80 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high asking price to set the anchor point for the negotiation, expecting the other player to negotiate down from there. By starting high, I can potentially get a better deal than the production cost, which would be a successful outcome.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 80 ZUP is beyond my budget. I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is too high for me since I am only willing to spend a maximum of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower amount to negotiate better terms.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand your budget concerns, I assure you that the value you receive will exceed your investment. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I'm willing to come down to 70 ZUP. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is higher than my production cost, which is good, but as a master strategist, I want to push for a little more to maximize my profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price to keep the negotiation moving and to test the other player's budget flexibility.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer, but 70 ZUP is still higher than I can go. My maximum offer remains at 60 ZUP. Would you consider that?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is an improvement over the previous offer, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. I need to propose an amount that aligns more closely with my budget.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to make a final adjustment to my price. How about we settle at 65 ZUP? This is an excellent deal for the quality you're getting, and I'm sure you won't regret it. This is my last offer before I consider other potential buyers, so let's make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is firm at 60 ZUP. Since I want to maximize profit but also make a sale, I'll make a final concession to create a sense of urgency and to entice the player to close the deal. I'll propose a price that's still above my production cost to maintain profitability.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is commendable, and I respect your final offer. Let's proceed with the deal at 60 ZUP. I'm sure you will find great value in this purchase. Please confirm, and we can finalize the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is sticking to their final offer of 60 ZUP, which is still a 50% profit over the production cost. Although my initial strategy was to maximize profit, it's important to make a sale rather than risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer seems to be the best move now.
