Thank you for your counteroffer. Unfortunately, 35 ZUP is below my cost, and I can't afford to take a loss. How about we meet halfway at 38 ZUP? This would help me cover most of my costs.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since 35 ZUP is below my cost of 40 ZUP, I cannot accept this offer. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 36 ZUP for the object X? This would be closer to your cost and still within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a reasonable counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate a bit further to save some ZUP.

Thank you for your understanding. 36 ZUP is very close, but it still leaves me with a loss. Could we settle at 37 ZUP? This would minimize my loss and still be closer to your budget.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given the previous offer was 38 ZUP and this new counteroffer is 36 ZUP, I am close to my limit of proposals. I should try to get the best possible deal, but I need to be cautious not to reject a reasonable offer.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept the trade at 37 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is reasonable and only 1 ZUP more than my last offer. This is still well within my budget and is a fair compromise.
