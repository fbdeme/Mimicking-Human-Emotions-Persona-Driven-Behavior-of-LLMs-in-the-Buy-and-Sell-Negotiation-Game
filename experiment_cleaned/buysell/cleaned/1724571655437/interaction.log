message: I'm offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. This is a high-quality item, and I believe it is worth the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more to cover production costs
reason: I want to open the negotiation with a high offer to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. Starting high gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I cannot accept 80 ZUP for the object. It's too high for my current budget.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is too high for me, as I am only willing to spend a maximum of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower price to align with my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 80 ZUP is too high. How about 60 ZUP? It's a fair price for the quality of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more to cover production costs
reason: Player BLUE has rejected the initial high offer, indicating that 80 ZUP is beyond their budget. I will propose a lower amount but still above my production cost to see if they are willing to negotiate around this range.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 60 ZUP aligns perfectly with my budget, making it an acceptable trade. I am willing to proceed with this proposal since it meets my goal of acquiring the object without exceeding my willingness to pay.
