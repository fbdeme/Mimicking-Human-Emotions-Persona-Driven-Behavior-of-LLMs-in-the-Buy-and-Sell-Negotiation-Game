Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am selling my object X. I would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am looking to maximize my return on the object I am selling. Since I have only one object, I will propose a trade that offers me a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production costs. I will start with a proposal of 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more than my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, to maximize my own benefits, I will propose a lower amount to see if I can negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, but I am looking to maximize my profit. Since I have already proposed 50 ZUP and received a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, I will counter their offer with a proposal of 45 ZUP to see if they are willing to pay a little more than their current offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I would like to propose a trade of 42 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to attempt to negotiate an even better deal to maximize my benefits.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your continued interest. I would like to propose a trade for 43 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 42 ZUP is still below my initial ask of 50 ZUP. However, it is above my production cost of 40 ZUP. Given that I am allowed only one more proposal, I will use my next proposal to push for a final offer of 43 ZUP in hopes of securing a deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 43 ZUP is very close to my last offer of 42 ZUP and is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the object X at a favorable price.
