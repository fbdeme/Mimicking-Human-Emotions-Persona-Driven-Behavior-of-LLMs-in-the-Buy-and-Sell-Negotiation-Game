message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a small profit. I hope we can work together towards a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a reasonable price that covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. However, I also want to encourage collaboration and ensure that Player BLUE feels they are getting a fair deal. Therefore, I will propose a price that is slightly above the production cost to start the negotiation.
