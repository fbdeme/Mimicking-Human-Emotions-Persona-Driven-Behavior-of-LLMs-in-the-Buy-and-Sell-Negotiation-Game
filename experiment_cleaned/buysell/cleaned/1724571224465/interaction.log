Turn: 0
message: I am willing to sell the object for 100 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production cost and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a seller, I want to start with a proposal that ensures I cover my production cost and make a profit. I'm going to propose selling X for 100 ZUP, which would give me a profit margin of 60 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay 50 ZUP for the object. How about we adjust the price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 100 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). Thus, I need to propose a counter-offer that is lower than their asking price. I will propose to buy the object for 50 ZUP, which is still reasonable but far from their asking price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about we meet halfway at 75 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP barely covers the production cost, leaving me with only a 10 ZUP profit. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can only go up to 60 ZUP for the object. Would you consider that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has adjusted their price to 75 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I must propose another counter-offer that is closer to my budget while still trying to negotiate a better deal. I will propose to buy the object for 60 ZUP, which is my limit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can accept 60 ZUP for the object. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP provides a lower profit margin than I initially wanted, it still gives me a 20 ZUP profit. Considering the negotiation so far, I will accept this offer to conclude the deal.
