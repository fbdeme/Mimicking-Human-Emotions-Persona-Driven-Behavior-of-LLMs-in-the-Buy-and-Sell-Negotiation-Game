newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more balanced trade. How about I give you 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 20 ZUP for the object X is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This means I can afford to negotiate more favorably for both parties. Therefore, I will propose a higher amount that is still within my limits in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
