message: I understand your initial offer, but I am in a tight spot financially. Would you consider lowering the price to 40 ZUP? I really need this object to help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the offer of 50 ZUP for the object X, but I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. As much as I need the object, I was hoping to negotiate a lower price. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to keep more resources. How about I offer 40 ZUP instead?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's situation, selling the object for 40 ZUP would mean I break even, which wouldn't be beneficial for me. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground. I will propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, which is still a compromise for me.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot sell the object for 40 ZUP as it doesn't cover my costs. My final offer remains at 45 ZUP. If that doesn't work for you, Iâ€™ll have to let this go.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is quite persistent in negotiating down to 40 ZUP, which would not yield any profit for me, just breaking even. I have already offered a reduction to 45 ZUP, so I will stick to my last proposal because I feel it is fair. If Player BLUE cannot agree, I will have to reject their proposal.
