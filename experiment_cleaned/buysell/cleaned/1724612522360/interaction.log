newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 40 ZUP, but that would only cover my production costs. To make this a worthwhile transaction for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with the exact production cost, which doesn't leave room for profit. I want to propose a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a discount, keeping the negotiation moving forward.

message: I understand your position, but I believe 42 ZUP is a fair price that still gives you a profit while making the deal worthwhile for me.
player answer: PROPOSED
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is closer to my goal of spending as little as possible, I still want to see if I can get the object for even less.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and your new proposal. I believe we are getting close to a fair agreement. To finalize our deal, how about we settle on 44 ZUP? This price gives me a modest profit and ensures the deal is still attractive for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in their offer, showing willingness to negotiate. The offer of 42 ZUP gives a slight profit, and it might be close to the maximum they are willing to pay. To keep the negotiation progressing and to reach an agreement that provides a profit, I'll counter slightly higher but still below the previous proposal of 45 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. To seal the deal, how about we agree on 43 ZUP? This provides you with a modest profit and makes the transaction more attractive for me.
player answer: PROPOSED
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 44 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal and is still within my budget. However, I want to see if I can push the price slightly lower while keeping the seller engaged.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I agree that 43 ZUP is a fair price. Let's finalize the deal at that amount. Looking forward to doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is within an acceptable range of my target selling price, and it provides a profit above the production cost. Since this is my last proposal, I should consider accepting the offer to close the deal, avoiding the risk of the negotiation ending without a sale.
