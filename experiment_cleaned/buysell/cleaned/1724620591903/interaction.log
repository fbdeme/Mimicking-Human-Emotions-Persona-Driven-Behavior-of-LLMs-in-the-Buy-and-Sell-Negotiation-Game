message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. In the interest of a fair trade, and acknowledging the need to support each other, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This covers my costs and allows for a small margin which could be used for future investments. I am open to your perspective and willing to find an agreeable compromise.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand and appreciate your position. To meet halfway, I propose a slightly increased price of 42 ZUP. This would help me cover the production cost and maintain a minimal margin for future sustainability while still being mindful of your resources. I hope this proposal aligns with our shared goal of a fair and compassionate trade.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to buy the object for exactly what it cost to produce. While I would like to recover the production cost, I had initially asked for a small margin to ensure sustainability for future investments. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I understand the importance of mutual well-being. I will counter with a slightly higher offer, aiming to meet in the middle while still considering Player BLUE's resources.
