message: I understand the importance of fair trade and believe that my resource will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X for 50 ZUP. This accounts not only for the production cost but also a reasonable profit margin for the quality and effort put into the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to at least break even and ideally make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Given that I also have my considerations, I propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 X. This still offers a reasonable profit margin for you while being more feasible for me.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and would like to reach an agreement that benefits us both. I propose a revised trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price ensures that I can cover production costs and achieve a modest profit, reflecting the value and effort invested in the resource while also taking into consideration your constraints. Let's work together to finalize a deal that is mutually advantageous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP only allows me to break even, which is not ideal as I am aiming for a profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure a profit margin.

message: Thank you for your revised offer. To ensure we both benefit, I propose a price of 35 ZUP for 1 X. This will still allow you to cover costs and gain a profit while being more favorable to my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to push for an even better deal. 35 ZUP is still beneficial to Player RED, pushing my advantage further.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your effort to negotiate a price that fits your budget. However, selling at 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for 1 X. This price allows me to secure a minimal profit while still being considerate of your budget constraints. I believe this offer is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new proposal of 35 ZUP is below my production costs, which would result in a loss. I cannot accept this trade as it does not meet my goal of making a profit. I will make another counteroffer slightly lower than my previous one but still above my production cost to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. To find a middle ground that works for both of us, I propose 38 ZUP for 1 X. This will still allow you to cover your costs and make a profit, while being more manageable for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 42 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, I want to push for an even better deal. Offering 38 ZUP will test Player RED's flexibility further while still being within a range they might accept.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I agree that finding a middle ground is essential for a successful negotiation. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for 1 X, as it covers the production costs and provides a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that considers both our needs.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the new offer of 38 ZUP is below the desired profit margin, it does cover production costs and offers a slight profit. As this is my last proposal, I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid a no-deal scenario, which would be more detrimental.
