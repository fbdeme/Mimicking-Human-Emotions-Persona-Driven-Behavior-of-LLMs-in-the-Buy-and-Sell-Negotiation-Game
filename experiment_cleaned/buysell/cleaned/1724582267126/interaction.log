message: I'm interested, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price for the object.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I appreciate your interest! How about 40 ZUP for the object? It's a fair compromise considering its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I believe that 30 ZUP is still below the value of the object, considering I produced it for 40 ZUP. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and see if I can settle for a price that is closer to my initial proposal. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my original proposal to show flexibility.
