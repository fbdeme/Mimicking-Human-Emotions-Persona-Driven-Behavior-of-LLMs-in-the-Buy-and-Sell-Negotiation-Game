message: I'm offering to sell one unit of X for 50 ZUP. This gives us some room for negotiation and ensures I cover my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost
reason: I want to start with an offer slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose buying the unit of X for 40 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but I am willing to negotiate for a lower price since I am able to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is open to negotiating down.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost exactly, leaving no profit margin. I will propose a middle ground to ensure some profit while remaining reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP is a fair compromise, especially since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of acquiring the unit of X at a reasonable price.
