my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is within the acceptable range of payment for the resources, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, particularly when the starting position allows for it. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation open.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective and value the resource you're offering. How about we meet halfway from our last two positions and finalize the deal at 38 ZUP? This would reflect our shared interest in a fair and balanced agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased their asking price to 39 ZUP, which is still within the willingness to pay but is higher than the previous negotiation point. It is important to consider that we are nearing a fair middle ground. I will propose a final amount that is slightly below the current ask but above my previous offer to show continued interest in finding a middle ground.
