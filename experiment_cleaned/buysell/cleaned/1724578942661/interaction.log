Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards a more reasonable price. However, 75 ZUP is still above what I'm prepared to pay. I would like to counter with an offer of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is closer to the value I have in mind.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 75 ZUP is still higher than the maximum I am willing to pay. I should make another proposal closer to my target but slightly higher to show willingness to negotiate. This should help in reaching an agreement that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay.
