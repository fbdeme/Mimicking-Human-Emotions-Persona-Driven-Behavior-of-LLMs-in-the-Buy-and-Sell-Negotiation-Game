message: Hello Player RED! I appreciate the hard work you've put into creating your object, and I'm sure it's of high quality. However, my resources are a bit limited and I aim to spend wisely. Could we consider a more mutually beneficial trade? How about I offer 40 ZUP for the object? This would cover your costs and give us both a chance to succeed together. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While I understand Player RED has put effort and resources into their product, their asking price is beyond what I am willing to pay according to my goals. I want to initiate the trade with a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay while still leaving some room for negotiation. Proposing a price that is 20 ZUP less than my maximum willingness to ensure there is room for negotiation and possible collaboration.
