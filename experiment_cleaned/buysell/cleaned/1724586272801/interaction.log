message: I am offering you the object X for just 1 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 1
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade to maximize my ZUP gain while minimizing the amount of ZUP I need to give up for the object X. I will start with an offer of 1 ZUP which is significantly low compared to the production cost. This will allow me to gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to negotiate.

message: How about I sell you the object X for 5 ZUP? I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with the same proposal which indicates that they might be willing to accept a low offer, but I need to be cautious. I will propose a slightly higher amount of ZUP to see if I can secure a better deal while still keeping my costs low. I will propose 5 ZUP this time to assess if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate further.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: What if I sell you the object X for 10 ZUP? I think this could be a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is not satisfied with my previous offer, I need to adjust my strategy. I will propose a higher ZUP amount this time, as they seem open to negotiating a better deal. I will increase my offer to 10 ZUP to see if this will convince them to accept the trade. This is still significantly lower than my production cost, so it should still benefit me.

message: The offer is getting more interesting, but I still think there's room for further negotiation. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay, so I need to carefully consider the next move.

Turn: 0
message: How about I sell you the object X for 15 ZUP? This is my final offer, and I believe it could work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's response indicates they are still looking for a better deal, which suggests they may not be ready to accept my previous offer. Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I will make my last proposal at 15 ZUP. This is still below my production cost but is an attempt to close the deal before I must accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: The offer is tempting, but I need to consider if it aligns with my maximum willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay, so I need to make a decision.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I accept the trade. I will sell you the object X for 15 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit of proposals and Player BLUE has not yet accepted or rejected my final offer, I will need to decide whether to accept or reject the current trade. The offer of 15 ZUP is still significantly lower than my production cost, which means that I would be taking a loss. However, I have maximized my proposals and must act now. I will ACCEPT the trade to secure at least some ZUP rather than risk losing the deal entirely.
