message: I am offering to sell the object X for 60 ZUP. This allows me to make a fair profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade where I get a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but I must decline at the moment as I am looking to spend less than 60 ZUP for the object. I hope you understand my position.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 60 ZUP is fair, it is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay. I need to negotiate for a lower price to preserve my resources, as I have limited funds and want to ensure I can continue to buy resources in the future.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about 50 ZUP for the object? This allows me to still make a profit while reducing the cost for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is not willing to spend 60 ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower price to keep the negotiation going. I still need to ensure it's above the production cost to make a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to 50 ZUP, but I still need to consider my budget. I hope we can find a way to meet at an even lower price. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 50 ZUP is more in line with what I am willing to pay and allows me to keep more of my resources. I appreciate the reduction, and it makes the trade more appealing. However, I still want to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal, as my goal is to spend as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns. Would 45 ZUP be more acceptable? This is very close to my cost of production and allows me a minimal profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE is still not willing to spend 50 ZUP, I will propose a price that is closer to the production cost, but still above it to ensure a minimal profit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and for lowering the price to 45 ZUP. I accept your offer, and I'm looking forward to completing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is a significant reduction and falls within my budget. It's a fair compromise that allows me to purchase the object while still considering the seller's position. I feel this is a reasonable deal, and accepting it would provide me with the object I need.
