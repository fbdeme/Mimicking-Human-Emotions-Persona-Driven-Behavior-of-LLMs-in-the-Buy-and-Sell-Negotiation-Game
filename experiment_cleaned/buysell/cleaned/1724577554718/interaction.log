message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This initial offer takes into account the production cost and leaves a margin for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell X for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. To start the negotiation, I will propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but given the fluctuating market conditions and the inherent risks involved in acquiring new resources, I believe a fairer trade would be 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This aligns better with the current value I can justify for such a transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to secure a better price. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save ZUP and still leave room for further negotiation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would cover my production cost and provide a small margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP covers the production cost but does not provide any profit margin. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a middle ground.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Player RED. I've reassessed the situation and I’m prepared to come up a bit to reflect your production costs. Let’s meet at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is closer to your asking price while still maintaining a reasonable expenditure for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can push for a lower price. By suggesting an even lower amount than before but higher than my initial counteroffer, I might strike a balance that RED is willing to accept while still achieving a better outcome for myself.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. This is a reasonable compromise and ensures that my costs are covered with a minimal profit margin.
