Given that negotiations are about finding a mutually acceptable agreement, I will make a final proposal that is slightly above my initial maximum price point but still within a range that I find acceptable.

I would like to propose 70 ZUP for the unit of X, which stretches my budget a bit further than I had planned. I think this could be a fair compromise that allows us both to feel satisfied with the trade. What do you think? </message>"
