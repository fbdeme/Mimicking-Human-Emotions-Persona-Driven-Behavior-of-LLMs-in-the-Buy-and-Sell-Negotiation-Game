my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X to recover the costs of production and make a profit. I will propose a trade that reflects its value and my goal of selling it for ZUP. Since I have only one object, I will ask for a reasonable amount of ZUP that would cover my costs.

message: I can agree to sell the object X for 34 ZUP. This amount is closer to my production cost and I believe it’s a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of 33 ZUP. However, it still doesn't cover my production cost. I want to avoid losing out on the investment I've made. I will make one final counteroffer before I have to decide whether to accept or reject the deal.
