my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object while being reasonable for Player BLUE. Since I need to recover some of the cost of producing the resource, I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer! How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? I hope we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to keep the negotiation positive and find a middle ground. I will propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP, which is still less than my initial ask but closer to covering my costs.

message: Thank you for considering my offer! How about we settle on 33 ZUP for the object X?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my budget and closer to my initial proposal. However, I'll attempt to negotiate a bit lower to save more ZUP.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate! I can offer you the object X for 34 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the flexibility in the negotiation and the continued interest from Player BLUE. However, while 33 ZUP is closer to my target, it still falls short of covering my production costs. To keep the spirit of negotiation alive and find a balance, I will propose a final counter-offer of 34 ZUP.
