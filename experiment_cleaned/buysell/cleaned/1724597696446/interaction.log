message: Hey, I'm willing to sell the object for 38 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to sell the object for a price close to my cost of production. This way, I can try to maximize my profit while still offering a fair deal to the buyer.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose a trade where I buy the object for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 38 ZUP for the object is within my budget and seems reasonable. However, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to maximize my resources while still making a fair offer.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to maintain a minimum price of 35 ZUP to cover my production cost. Let me know if you're willing to consider this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price, but it's well below my production cost. I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin, so I'll need to counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's complete the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise from my previous offer of 30 ZUP. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and it allows the seller to cover their production costs. I am inclined to accept this trade as it is within my budget.
