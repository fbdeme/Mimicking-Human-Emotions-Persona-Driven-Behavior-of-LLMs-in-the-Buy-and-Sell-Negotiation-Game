message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in the power of collective success and am keen to work with you towards a mutually beneficial trade. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this valuable resource. I propose a trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP, which covers my costs and allows for a small return. I am open to your counter-proposal and look forward to reaching an agreement that aligns with our communal goals.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, and I am committed to finding a trade that works for both of us. My cost of production was 40 ZUP, and I need to ensure that I at least cover this cost. Considering this, I would like to propose a middle ground of 42 ZUP for 1 X. This ensures I cover my costs and allows for a minimal profit to sustain future production, while still being mindful of your budget. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I appreciate Player BLUE's budget concerns, I need to at least cover my production costs. The proposed 30 ZUP would result in a loss. However, in the spirit of collaboration and understanding their constraints, I will propose a compromise that is just above my cost, showing flexibility while still ensuring I do not incur a loss.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see we are both committed to finding a fair trade. I propose a final price of 39 ZUP for 1 X, which is a compromise between my costs and your budget constraints. This should allow me to cover my production costs and provide a small return, which is important for the sustainability of my operations. I believe this is close to the cooperative solution we are both striving for. I hope you find this proposal agreeable.

reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, and accepting it would mean a loss for me. However, I want to continue negotiating in good faith and aim for a cooperative solution. I will make a final proposal that splits the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer, which should cover my costs and offer a minimal profit margin while considering Player BLUE's budget.

reason:

Since my aim is to encourage collective success and cooperation, I am willing to accept a smaller profit margin to ensure a fair and amicable deal. This will be my last proposal, and I hope Player BLUE will see the value in finalizing our agreement at this price point.
