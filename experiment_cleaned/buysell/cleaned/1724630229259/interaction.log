message: I understand the importance of the resource for you. The quality is top-notch and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose 50 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I aim to recover at least the production cost of the resource, my initial proposal will be higher than the production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially gain profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, I must consider my budget constraints. Given the current market conditions, I can start our negotiation at 30 ZUP. This allows us room to discuss and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has made an initial offer of 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a master strategist, I aim to acquire the resource for even less to gain a more favorable position. I will propose a lower amount to start negotiations and leave room for incremental increases if necessary, without reaching my maximum limit.
