message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose to trade my resource (X) for 45 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and a slight margin to ensure sustainability in our practices. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that I can recoup the production costs of the resource, which is 40 ZUP, while also keeping in mind the goal of minimizing ZUP spending to encourage sustainability. My initial proposal will be set at a slightly higher amount to allow room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower amount.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the production costs and the importance of sustainable practices, I propose a price of 38 ZUP for my resource. This ensures that the costs are covered and we are both contributing to a sustainable future. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that does not cover the production cost of the resource. As my goal is to not only cover my costs but also promote sustainable practices, I need to counter-propose with a higher amount. However, I will come down from my initial asking price to move the negotiation forward and try to find a middle ground that can satisfy both our needs.
