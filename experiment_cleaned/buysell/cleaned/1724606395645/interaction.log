Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm definitely interested in the object. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 30 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a strategic move, I want to negotiate for a better deal to conserve my resources. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the fair price for this object is 35 ZUP. Let me know if you're willing to agree on this amount.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in the object but proposed a lower price of 30 ZUP. I need to consider if I'm willing to accept this price or if I want to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 35 ZUP, which is still within my goal range. I'm inclined to accept this offer since it is a fair price and well below my maximum willingness to pay. This would conclude the negotiation favorably for me without further back-and-forth.
