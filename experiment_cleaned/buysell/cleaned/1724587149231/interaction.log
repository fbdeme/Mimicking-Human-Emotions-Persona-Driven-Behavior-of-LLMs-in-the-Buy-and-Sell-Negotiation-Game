my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to cover the cost of production. I'm in a tight spot financially and must get some ZUP quickly. Offering a lower price might elicit sympathy from Player BLUE and lead to a successful trade.
