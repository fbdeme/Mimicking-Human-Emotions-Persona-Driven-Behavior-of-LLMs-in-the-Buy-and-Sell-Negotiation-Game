message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to make a fair trade that compensates for the production cost and provides a profit. Therefore, I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Feel free to make a counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. I hope this can work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so I will propose a counteroffer that is more favorable for me while still being reasonable for Player RED. I will offer 45 ZUP to keep the negotiation friendly and ensure that I can still achieve my goal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I would like to propose a trade of 47 ZUP for the object X. This amount allows me to cover the production costs and ensures both of us can walk away satisfied. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers my production cost with a small profit. To keep negotiations moving and to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties, I will propose a slightly higher amount, aiming to meet in the middle of our initial proposals.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 47 ZUP is within my budget and is a reasonable compromise between both our offers. I believe it is a fair price that respects Player RED's production costs while still being acceptable to me. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
