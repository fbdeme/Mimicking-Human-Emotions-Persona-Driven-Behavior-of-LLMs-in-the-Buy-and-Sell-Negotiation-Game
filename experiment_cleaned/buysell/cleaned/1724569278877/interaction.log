message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell this valuable resource. I had to put quite a bit into producing it, so I'm hoping to get 50 ZUP in return. Can we make this work?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by making an initial offer that slightly exceeds my production cost. This leaves room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we meet in the middle at 40 ZUP? That way, I don't incur a loss.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
