message: I have an object X for sale. Would you like to buy it for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that allows me to sell my object X at a price that is beneficial for me. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs. I'll start by proposing a price that is slightly lower than my production cost to entice Player BLUE.
