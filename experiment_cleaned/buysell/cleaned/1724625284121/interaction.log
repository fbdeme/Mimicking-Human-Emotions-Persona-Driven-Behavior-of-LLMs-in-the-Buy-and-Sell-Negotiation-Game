message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the quality and the production cost. Are you interested in discussing this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I invested 40 ZUP into producing the resource, I want to start by proposing a price above that to ensure a profit. However, I don't want to start too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a starting price of 50 ZUP to open up the negotiation and see how Player BLUE responds.
