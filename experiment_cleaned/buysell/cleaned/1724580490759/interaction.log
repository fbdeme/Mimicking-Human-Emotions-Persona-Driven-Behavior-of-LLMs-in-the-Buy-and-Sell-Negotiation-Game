message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a fair profit margin.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover my production cost of 40 ZUP and ideally make a profit. My initial offer will consider a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, but I would like to propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It's a competitive price, considering the current market rate, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As the opening proposal from Player RED is exactly at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay, I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to save some ZUP while still opening the door to a potentially acceptable range for both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP? This provides a fair profit margin for me while still being a competitive price for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and covers my production costs with a small profit. However, I would like to aim for a slightly better margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a reasonable approach. However, to account for my budget constraints and to make the deal more appealing for my side, I propose 53 ZUP for the unit of X. This price should still be profitable for you while also considering my willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer that is closer to my upper limit. Since it's still within the acceptable range, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal, potentially saving a few more ZUP while moving towards a middle ground that could be agreeable to both parties.

reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is close to my desired price and still provides a profit margin above my production cost. I will accept this offer as it is reasonable and aligns with my goals.
