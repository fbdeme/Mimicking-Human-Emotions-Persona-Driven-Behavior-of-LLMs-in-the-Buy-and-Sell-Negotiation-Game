message: I understand we're both looking for a fair deal here. Given the quality and the production cost of my resource, I'm sure you'll find this initial offer quite reasonable. Remember, good investments lead to great returns.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a shrewd negotiator, my first proposal should start above my production cost to give room for negotiation and to test the waters of what Player BLUE is willing to pay. I want to ensure a profit margin while also leaving room to decrease the amount in further proposals if necessary.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your search for a fair deal, I must consider the production costs and the inherent value of the resource. A price of 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me, which is not sustainable. However, I believe we can meet in the middle. How does 45 ZUP sound to you? It's a competitive price that reflects both the market conditions and the quality of what's being offered.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that's below my production cost. As a shrewd negotiator, I need to counter back with a higher amount to push towards a more favorable trade that ensures I cover my costs and make a profit. I'll propose a number closer to my production cost but still above it to maintain a bargaining position.

message: I understand your position, but considering the market conditions and our negotiation, I propose 35 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation, and I believe we are moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, at 35 ZUP, I am still not covering my production expenses. To ensure a viable transaction for both of us, I propose a fair price of 42 ZUP. This accounts for my costs and provides you with the resource you need at a fair market value. Let's make a deal that's profitable for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I need to push for a price that at least covers my costs and allows for a marginal profit. I'll propose a price slightly above my cost, but not too high to avoid losing the deal. This should signal to Player BLUE that I am looking for a serious offer that respects my bottom line.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to find common ground. I am committed to finalizing our negotiation with a fair price for both parties. Therefore, I propose 41 ZUP for the resource as a final offer. This ensures I cover my production costs and allows for a minimal profit margin, which is essential for the sustainability of my business. I believe this is a middle ground that indeed benefits us both. Shall we agree on this and proceed?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is nearing my production cost, but it is still below it. This is my final proposal, and I want to secure a small profit while also closing the deal. I will propose a price that is just above my production cost to ensure I am not operating at a loss. A small profit is better than no profit, especially since I want to close the deal and maintain good relations for potential future transactions.
