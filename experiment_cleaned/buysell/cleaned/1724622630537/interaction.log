message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your valuation of the craftsmanship. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial price. How about 48 ZUP for object X? It's a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, and while I want to make a profit, I also need to consider their maximum willingness to pay. I will make a counteroffer that is above their proposal but below their maximum willingness to pay to try to find a middle ground.

message: I'm glad to hear you are considering my offer of 48 ZUP for object X. Take the time you need, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or would like to finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE seems to be considering my last proposal. Since they have not made a new counteroffer and are taking time to think, I will not make a new proposal at this point. I will wait for them to respond and decide whether to accept or propose a new trade.
