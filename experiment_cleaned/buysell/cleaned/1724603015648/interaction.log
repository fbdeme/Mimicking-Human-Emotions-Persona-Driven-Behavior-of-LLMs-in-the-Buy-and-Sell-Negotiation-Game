message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing this object for 40 ZUP? I believe it's a fair price considering the sustainability aspect.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer, but I believe 40 ZUP is quite a bit more than I was looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider 25 ZUP for the object? I think it's a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object and the initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, I will start with a lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation. My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally significantly less than 60 ZUP, to achieve a strategic advantage and save resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I need to cover the cost of production, so I propose selling the object for 30 ZUP. This ensures sustainability while accommodating your budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting 25 ZUP, which is lower than my initial offer. However, I need to ensure that the price reflects the cost of production to maintain sustainability. I'll propose a counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your understanding. To meet halfway, I can increase my offer to 28 ZUP. This should help cover your costs while still keeping the transaction economical for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 30 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but since I aim to spend as little as possible and maintain a strategic edge, I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below their asking price. This way, I can potentially secure the object for less than they are asking, but more than my initial offer, finding a middle ground and conserving my resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise. To sustainably cover the production cost, I propose selling the object for 29 ZUP, which is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased the offer to 28 ZUP, which is closer to covering the production cost. However, I need to ensure the sustainability of the transaction. I will make a final proposal considering the compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm pleased with your proposal, and I accept the trade for 29 ZUP. It's a fair price, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is 29 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and well within the range I am willing to pay. Since my goal is to spend the least ZUP possible, I could try to negotiate further. However, considering the small difference and the risk of reaching an impasse, it might be more advantageous to accept this offer. This will secure the object for a low price without further risking the negotiation and will save my remaining proposal in case this acceptance is somehow countered unexpectedly.
