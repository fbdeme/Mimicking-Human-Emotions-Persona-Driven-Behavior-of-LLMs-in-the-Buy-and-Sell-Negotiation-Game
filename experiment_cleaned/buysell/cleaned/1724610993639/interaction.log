message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you'll find indispensable. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting the bidding at 100 ZUP. I'm convinced you'll appreciate its worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a high asking price gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above my production costs, thus ensuring a profit. It also sets the anchor point for the negotiation in my favor.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 100 ZUP is too high, considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but let's find a middle ground. The object's quality surpasses standard production, and I believe 80 ZUP reflects its true value while still being a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, I want to negotiate for a higher amount to ensure a profit. However, I will lower my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate and come closer to their offer, keeping in mind that I want to end with more than my production costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about 50 ZUP? I believe this is a fair offer considering both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I should make another proposal closer to my limit but higher than my initial offer to show flexibility.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer is getting closer to a fair deal, but considering the exceptional quality of the item, I propose 70 ZUP. This price adequately reflects the value and still gives you a fantastic deal for the caliber of the object you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now above my production costs. However, as my goal is to maximize profit and I have room for one more proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to push for a better deal while still staying reasonable and attractive to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're on the same page regarding the quality of the object. I propose a final offer of 65 ZUP, which I believe honors the value of the object while also respecting your willingness to compromise. This is a very fair middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a concession that is above my production cost, but less than my previous proposal. As this is my final proposal, I must choose my next move wisely. Accepting 60 ZUP would give me a profit, but I will attempt one last time to increase the amount. If Player BLUE refuses, I can still choose to accept or reject their last offer of 60 ZUP in the next round.
