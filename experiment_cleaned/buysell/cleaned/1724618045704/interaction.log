message: I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. Let's start the negotiations at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I would like to start the negotiations with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose buying the object for 40 ZUP instead. Let’s negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay since I can go up to 60 ZUP. However, I would like to start negotiations lower in hopes of reaching a better deal. I will propose to buy the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost RED mentioned.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I would like to make a small profit on the sale. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy at my production cost, which would mean I would not make a profit. I want to counter with a price that allows me to make some profit while still being reasonable to the buyer. A midpoint between our two proposals is 45 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Let’s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 45 ZUP, which is closer to my willingness to pay. This amount is still below my maximum price and allows RED to make a small profit. Accepting this trade would be reasonable, as it meets both of our needs.
