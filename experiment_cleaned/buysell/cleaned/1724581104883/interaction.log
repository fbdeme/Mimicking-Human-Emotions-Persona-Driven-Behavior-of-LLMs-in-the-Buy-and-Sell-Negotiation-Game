my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I believe 40 ZUP is a more fair price for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current offer is at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert dominance by negotiating a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but how about we settle at 50 ZUP for the object X? It’s a good deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that matches the cost of production. While it is a fair price, I need to negotiate a better deal that allows me to profit from the sale. I will counter with a slightly lower amount to see if I can still make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your point. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to reduce the amount of ZUP spent even further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let’s finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is a fair compromise between my initial proposal and their offer. Since I initially aimed for a higher price and have already proposed twice, accepting this trade would yield a profit for me.
