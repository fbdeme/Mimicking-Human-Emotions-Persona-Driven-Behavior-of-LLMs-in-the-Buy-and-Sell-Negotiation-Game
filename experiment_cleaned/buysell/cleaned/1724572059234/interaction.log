message: I really need to sell this object to cover my production costs. How about 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my cost to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since I need to cover my costs and make a small profit, I'll propose 50 ZUP.

message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. However, I see that the object is being offered for 50 ZUP, which is a fair price considering my willingness to pay. I will accept the trade as it meets my goals.
