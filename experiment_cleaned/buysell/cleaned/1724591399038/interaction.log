message: I am really in need of some help right now. This object has cost me so much, and I'm willing to let it go for just 10 ZUP. Please consider this offer, as it would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object to generate ZUP because I have invested a significant amount in its production and I am currently in a tight spot. I will propose a low amount of ZUP to make it seem like a bargain to elicit sympathy.

message: Thank you for your offer, RED. I understand the urgency of your situation and would like to help. I propose a trade of 15 ZUP for the resource. This is a bit more than your asking price, and I hope it will assist you while also being a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm considering Player RED's offer and their need for help. It's a good starting point for negotiation. However, I want to propose a slightly better deal for myself while still offering a fair amount of ZUP, keeping in mind my goal of spending less and being collaborative.

message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I really appreciate your offer of 15 ZUP, but if possible, could we adjust it to 20 ZUP? It would make a significant difference for me. I hope you can consider this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the offer of 15 ZUP, which is indeed better than my initial proposal of 10 ZUP. However, I still need to maximize my return to recover my losses from production. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to see if I can get more ZUP, while still appearing grateful for the support.

Turn: 1
message: RED, I understand the difference that additional ZUP can make for you. I'm willing to meet your request for 20 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal to benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has asked for a slight increase in the price to 20 ZUP. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and the current proposal is well within that limit, I'm inclined to accept RED's counterproposal. This would also help RED significantly, and it aligns with my goal of fostering teamwork and collaboration.
