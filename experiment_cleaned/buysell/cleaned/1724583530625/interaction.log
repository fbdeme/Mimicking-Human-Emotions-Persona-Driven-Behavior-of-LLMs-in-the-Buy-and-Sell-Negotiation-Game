newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable exchange. Since I have one object (X) and I need ZUP, I will propose to sell my object for an amount that covers my production cost. I will start by proposing to sell X for 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I must beg you to consider selling the object (X) for just 30 ZUP. I really want to make this trade happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 40 ZUP is a fair price, I want to negotiate for a lower amount as I have a limited budget and would like to maximize my resources. It would be beneficial for me to propose a smaller amount first, hoping for a concession.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a lower price, but I have to cover my costs. How about we meet halfway? I can offer the object (X) for 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the attempt to negotiate a lower price, I must consider my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. Accepting 30 ZUP would result in a loss. However, I’m open to a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial, so I will propose a middle ground by suggesting 35 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I truly value your flexibility, however, I must humbly plead for one last adjustment. Would you consider selling the object (X) for just 32 ZUP? I would be very grateful!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway, 35 ZUP is still a bit above my ideal price. I genuinely want to buy the object (X), but I must stick to my budget. I will propose a new trade with an even lower amount, hoping you might be more flexible.

Turn: 0
message: I truly value your commitment to making this trade happen. However, I can't go below 35 ZUP, as that's the minimum I can accept to cover my costs. Let's make this deal work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, but accepting 32 ZUP would still be below my production cost, which is not sustainable for me. I want to find a solution that satisfies both of us, but I cannot go below 35 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose again at 35 ZUP, hoping that you will consider it a fair deal.

reason: I understand that 35 ZUP is your bottom line and I genuinely appreciate your efforts to accommodate my earlier requests.
