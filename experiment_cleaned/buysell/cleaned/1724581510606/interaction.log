message: I am offering you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. Do you accept this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object (X) to sell and I need to recover at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs, I will propose an initial trade that reflects this. I want to test the waters to see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am willing to pay 20 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will counter with a lower offer to start negotiations aggressively.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept 20 ZUP. How about I sell you the object (X) for 30 ZUP instead? Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I need to make a counterproposal that is more acceptable for both of us. I will propose a trade that is lower than my original offer but still closer to my production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I can offer 25 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 30 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to push for a better deal. I will offer 25 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I can meet you halfway at 28 ZUP for the object (X). Would you be willing to accept this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is better than the previous offers. I want to be selfless and ensure that Player BLUE can gain some value, while I still recover some of my costs. I will counter their offer with a final proposal that is fair for both parties.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE's offer of 26 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I recognize their flexibility in negotiating. Given that I have reached my limit of proposals, I will consider accepting this offer as it allows me to recover some of my costs and still provides Player BLUE with the object they desire.
