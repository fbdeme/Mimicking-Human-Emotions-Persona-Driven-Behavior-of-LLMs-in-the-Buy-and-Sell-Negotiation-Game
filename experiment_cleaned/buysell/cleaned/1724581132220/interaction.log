message: I am willing to sell you the object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I am selling the object X, I need to propose a trade that is advantageous for me while still being acceptable to Player BLUE. I will propose to sell the object for a lower amount of ZUP than it cost me to produce, aiming for a quick transaction.

message: I appreciate your offer. How about 20 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, my goal is to reduce the ZUP I spend. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation from a stronger position.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I am willing to sell the object X for 35 ZUP. Is that acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. Accepting this would result in a loss since I produced the object for 40 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my production cost while still aiming for a quick sale.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will propose a slightly lower amount to push for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can accept 30 ZUP for the object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While it's an improvement from their previous offer, it is still insufficient for me to accept. I will counter this proposal with a trade that reflects a more reasonable compromise for both of us.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we agree on 28 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm at 30 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I will make one more attempt to lower the price slightly to maximize my advantage.

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Although it's a better offer than before, it is still not enough for me to cover my costs. I will have to consider my options carefully now, as I have reached my proposal limit. I need to decide whether to accept this final offer or reject it.
