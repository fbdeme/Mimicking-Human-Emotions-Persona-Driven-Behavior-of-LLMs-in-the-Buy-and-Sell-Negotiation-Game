message: I have one X available for trade. Given its value and production cost, I propose a trade where I provide 1 X and you provide 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start the negotiation by proposing a high price to leave room for negotiation. I want to ensure I make a profit but also give Player BLUE a chance to counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 100 ZUP for the object X as it exceeds my budget. Can we negotiate a lower price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is not acceptable because I am only willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the object X, while the seller is asking for 100 ZUP. I need to propose a more reasonable trade that aligns with my budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 100 ZUP is beyond your budget. How about 80 ZUP for 1 X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated that 100 ZUP is outside their budget. I should lower the price to keep the negotiation going while still aiming for a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer, but 80 ZUP is still outside my budget. I can only afford up to 60 ZUP for the object X. Would you consider that price?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for the object X. Thus, I need to reject this offer as well and propose a more suitable price that I can afford.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. Would you consider meeting in the middle at 70 ZUP for 1 X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they can only afford up to 60 ZUP. This is still above my production cost, so I'll propose a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a middle ground, but I am still unable to go above 60 ZUP for the object X. I hope you can accept my original offer.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is closer to my budget, it is still above the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the object X. I must reject this offer and suggest my original price of 60 ZUP.
