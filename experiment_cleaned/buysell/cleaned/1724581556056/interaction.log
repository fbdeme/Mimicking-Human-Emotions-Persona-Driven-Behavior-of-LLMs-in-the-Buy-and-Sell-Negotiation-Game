message: I am offering you the object for 35 ZUP. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that is slightly lower than that to encourage a purchase while also taking into account my goal of preserving resources.

message: Thank you for your offer! I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP for the object is reasonable and well within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I aim to reduce my ZUP expenditure if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 30 ZUP for the object. I believe this is more reflective of its value. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, it is significantly lower than the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I want to ensure that I sell the object at a price that reflects its value while still being reasonable. I will propose a counter-offer that is closer to my original proposal, aiming to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I accept the trade for 30 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. Given that the difference between 25 ZUP and 30 ZUP is not significant and to maintain good relations, I am inclined to accept this proposal.
