Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have one unit of X available. Given the uniqueness and quality of this object, my initial asking price is 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I aim to start with a higher proposal to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and to maximize my profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I'll start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Given that I have limited resources, I propose 40 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is too high. I need to negotiate to get the price down to my maximum willingness of 60 ZUP. I will start with a lower offer to anchor the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs without any profit. How about we settle at 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, but it doesn't provide any profit margin. I will counter with a proposal slightly higher than my cost to see if I can secure a small profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable compromise that meets my goal without exceeding my budget.
