message: Hello Player RED, I understand you are looking for a fair profit. However, I'm working with a limited budget and would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the resource X. This should still offer you a profit and it would be within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has offered but still within the range I am willing to pay. This allows room for further negotiation and possibly a better deal for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This price allows me to cover my production costs and ensures a modest profit, while still being close to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and ensures a small profit. However, considering the production cost and aiming for a bit more profit while maintaining a collaborative approach, I will propose a slightly higher amount.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
