message: I have a high-quality item X ready for sale. Considering the costs and the market value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting offer. Let's discuss.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to aim for a profit, so I will propose a price that is higher than my production cost, leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP for item X. Let's see if we can find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the item X is reasonable, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose a lower amount while still aiming to acquire the item.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need for a fair deal. However, to make this transaction worthwhile, I need to cover costs and include a modest profit. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I aim to negotiate a higher price that allows for a profit margin. A counteroffer between the initial proposal and the counterproposal seems reasonable.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I can offer 42 ZUP for item X. I hope this can work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the compromise at 45 ZUP, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one, as it is still less than 50 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer of 42 ZUP. I'm glad to see we are moving closer to an agreement. To finalize our deal and ensure a fair profit for the quality of item X, I propose a trade for 44 ZUP. I believe this is a competitive price that reflects the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is above my production cost, allowing for a small profit. However, as a fierce negotiator, I should aim for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return. I will make one more counteroffer closer to my last proposal but still giving a little ground to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle on 43 ZUP for item X? I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 44 ZUP is closer to my willingness to pay, but I still want to maximize my savings. I will propose a counter-offer of 43 ZUP, which is just below the last offer while still showing I'm serious about the deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 43 ZUP is acceptable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate fairly. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is only 1 ZUP less than my previous counteroffer, and it still ensures a profit. This is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject any further offers. Since the offer is reasonable and close to my desired amount, I will accept it to secure a profit and close the deal.
