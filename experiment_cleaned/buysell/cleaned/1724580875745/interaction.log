message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE! How about we meet halfway at 25 ZUP for the object? I believe this can be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
