message: I really need your help. This object means a lot to me, and I'm hoping you can help me out with just 20 ZUP. It would mean the world to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that reflects my need to sell the object while appealing to Player BLUE's sense of generosity. Since I only have one object, I will propose a trade for a lower amount of ZUP than I originally produced it for, creating urgency and a sense of desperation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am starting with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, knowing that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. By expressing a personal attachment to the object, I aim to appeal to Player RED's empathy, potentially making them more inclined to agree to a lower price. This strategy also sets the stage for a narrative where I might seem desperate or less capable of higher payment, potentially lowering Player RED's expectations.

message: I canâ€™t express how much I appreciate your consideration. If you could help me with 30 ZUP instead, it would really make a difference for me! I truly value this opportunity!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE did not respond directly to my proposal, I will continue to appeal to their emotions and propose a slightly better offer that still reflects my desperation. I will raise the ZUP amount but still keep it lower than the original cost to entice them.

message: Your understanding means so much to me. I can stretch a little bit to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 25 ZUP? This is a significant amount for me, but for this object, I'm willing to make an effort.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is still well below my maximum threshold, which is a good sign. They've only increased their request by 10 ZUP, which is a reasonable increment and still allows for further negotiation. By maintaining the narrative of valuing the object highly, I can continue to play on emotional appeal while also leaving room to increase my offer if necessary. However, I will aim to secure the resource for even less than the proposed 30 ZUP to adhere to my goal of minimizing expenditure.

message: Thank you so much for your generosity! I truly appreciate you meeting me halfway. This means a lot to me, and I'm happy to finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is a significant improvement from my previous proposals, and it shows their willingness to compromise. I will accept this trade as it allows me to sell the object while also gaining some ZUP, even if it's below my production cost.
