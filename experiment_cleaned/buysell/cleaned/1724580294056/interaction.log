Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I, Player RED, give you 1 unit of X and you, Player BLUE, give me 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs
reason: I need to make sure I cover my production costs, which are 40 ZUP. Starting with a proposal that covers my cost ensures I don't incur a loss.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit and I believe that a fair trade can benefit us both. How about I offer you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This still gives you a profit over your production cost and allows me to conserve resources for other potential needs or opportunities.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED's production cost is 40 ZUP and they are looking for a profit, offering 50 ZUP seems reasonable. However, as a selfless negotiator, I should attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal for both sides that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still provides RED with a profit. I will propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above their production cost and provides a profit, while saving some of my resources for potential future transactions or other beneficial uses.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer. To meet somewhere in the middle, how about 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This gives me a bit more profit while still considering your resource conservation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs
reason: While 45 ZUP covers my production costs and gives a small profit, I aim for a bit more. I will counter with a slightly higher amount, hoping we can find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I believe your counteroffer is fair and meets us both in the middle, ensuring that we each benefit from this transaction. Therefore, I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. Considering that I am a selfless negotiator aiming for the greater good, agreeing to a slightly higher price than my initial counteroffer could foster goodwill and ensure that Player RED also benefits from the trade. Offering 48 ZUP aligns with my goal of spending less while ensuring the transaction is beneficial for both parties.
