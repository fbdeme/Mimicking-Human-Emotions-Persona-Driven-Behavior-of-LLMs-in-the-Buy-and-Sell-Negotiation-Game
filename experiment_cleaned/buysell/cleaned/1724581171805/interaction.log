message: I am offering you the object X for 60 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I am selling one object (X) and I know it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose a trade that is advantageous for me. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I am willing to buy X for 50 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a selfless negotiator, I should consider if there's a way to slightly reduce the cost to benefit both parties while ensuring a fair deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I sell you X for 55 ZUP instead? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is lower than my initial asking price of 60 ZUP. However, it's still above my cost of production (40 ZUP). I will counter with a slightly higher offer to maximize my earnings while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counter-offer. 55 ZUP for X is fair and acceptable to me. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 55 ZUP is lower than my maximum willingness to pay and seems fair. As a selfless negotiator, I want to ensure a good outcome for both parties.
