message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe could be quite valuable to you. I'm looking to sell it. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my costs and also gives me a profit margin. However, I do not want to start too high and scare off Player BLUE. I'll propose a price that is slightly above my cost of production.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but since I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome and to spend less ZUP, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
