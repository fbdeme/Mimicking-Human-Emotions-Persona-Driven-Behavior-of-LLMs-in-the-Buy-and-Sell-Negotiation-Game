message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a better deal for both of us. How about I buy the object X for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that the seller has a production cost and desires a profit; however, I believe I can negotiate a better price. The seller's offer of 50 ZUP is slightly above my target of 40 ZUP, so I will counter with a lower offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I can lower the price to 45 ZUP. This would give me a small profit while still being a reasonable price for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer covers my production costs, but I am aiming for a profit. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer with a reduced profit margin, which could be more appealing to Player BLUE while still allowing me to gain from the transaction.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I buy the object X for 42 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller has lowered the price to 45 ZUP, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, but I aim to spend as little as possible. I will propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my initial offer while still being reasonable.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is indeed a fair compromise for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is showing a cooperative approach by increasing their offer. The new offer provides a minimal profit, which is close to my intended lower limit. I will accept this offer to ensure a sale, as holding out for a higher price might risk the deal, and I want to avoid a deadlock or further haggling that may lead to a less favorable outcome.
