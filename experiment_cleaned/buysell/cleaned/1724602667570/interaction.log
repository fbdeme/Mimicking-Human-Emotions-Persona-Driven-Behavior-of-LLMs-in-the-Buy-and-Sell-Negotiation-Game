message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to trade, but as someone who prioritizes sustainability, I need to ensure that our resources are used efficiently. Would you consider 1 X for 15 ZUP? This would help us both conserve resources for the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 20 ZUP which is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. It's a favorable starting point, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to minimize ZUP spending to preserve resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP while still making a fair offer.
