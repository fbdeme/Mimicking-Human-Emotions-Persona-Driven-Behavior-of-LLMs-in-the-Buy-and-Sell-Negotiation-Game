Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see your interest in the object. Considering its quality and the market conditions, I believe it's fair to adjust the price slightly to 65 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial offer, which is a good sign. The offer is at the price I suggested which is more than the production cost, fulfilling my goal of selling for a profit. However, as a dominant negotiator, I might try to push for a slightly better deal to test the waters and maximize my gain.

message: I understand the value of your object, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for it. Is there any way we can reach an agreement at that price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the quality of the object, 65 ZUP exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate better terms to stay within my financial limits.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet halfway between my last proposal and your offer. I propose 63 ZUP for the object. This is a great deal for an item of such high quality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 63
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE insists on 60 ZUP, and since this meets my goal of selling above production cost, it is a reasonable offer. However, I've only used two of my four proposals, and I might attempt one more time to gain a better position in this negotiation. If Player BLUE rejects again, I will be prepared to accept the offer of 60 ZUP in order to make a sale and not risk losing the deal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, but I must decline your offer of 63 ZUP as it exceeds my budget. I can only go up to 60 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the compromise to 63 ZUP, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to maintain my budget and cannot accept this offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your firm stance is noted and respected. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for my object. Let's proceed with the sale.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my counteroffer and is firm on their position of not exceeding 60 ZUP. Since my goal is to make a profit and their offer is still above my production cost, it is in my best interest to close the deal at this price. Further negotiation could risk losing the sale altogether, and I have already demonstrated my ambition by attempting to negotiate for a higher price.
