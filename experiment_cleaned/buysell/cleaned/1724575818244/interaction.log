message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm excited to work together on this trade! I propose selling the object X for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and provide a fair profit. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production cost and ideally more to ensure a profit
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a reasonable profit margin in mind, while also being mindful of Player BLUE's resources. I can propose an initial trade that reflects this.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED! I understand your costs and desire for profit. However, I believe that a more balanced trade would be for me to purchase the object X for 50 ZUP. This still gives you a significant profit margin above your production costs. Let's work together to finalize a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has opened with a proposal that matches the upper limit of my willing to pay range. However, as a dominant negotiator, my aim is to push for a better deal and assert a stronger position. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to preserve my ZUP resources as much as possible. Iâ€™ll propose a price that's more favorable to me, yet still within a reasonable range, considering RED's production costs.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE! I appreciate your willingness to work together. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, I can secure a better profit margin while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production cost and ideally more to ensure a profit
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and still provides a profit of 10 ZUP above the production cost. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that offers a slightly better profit margin for me while still being fair.

message: Player RED, I see the value in meeting halfway and appreciate your flexibility. To edge closer to an agreement that maximizes benefits for us both, I propose 53 ZUP for the object X. This offer is above your production cost and still provides a healthy profit margin for you, while allowing me to conserve resources for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. While this is a reasonable compromise, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to push the envelope a bit further to assert my dominance and improve my position. I should aim to make one more counteroffer to see if RED is willing to come down just a bit more, but it's important to keep the counteroffer fair and not risk ending negotiations prematurely.

my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production cost and ideally more to ensure a profit
