message: 
Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE! I have a high-quality object X that I believe you will find invaluable. It's an exceptional product, and I've invested a considerable amount of resources into its creation. I propose a trade where you receive this object for a mere 60 ZUP. A fair price for something of such fine caliber, don't you agree?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price than my production cost to create room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit. By opening with a higher offer, I can gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and adjust accordingly in subsequent proposals.
