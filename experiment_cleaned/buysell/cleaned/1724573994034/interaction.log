message: I'm offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. This is a high-quality item and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling the object. The cost to produce it was 40 ZUP, so I need to sell it for more than that to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that is significantly higher than the cost, anticipating that there might be some negotiation.
