message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be immensely valuable for you. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP to cover my production costs and potentially make a profit. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I need to propose a trade that covers my costs and offers a margin for profit. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider lowering the price to 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the resource offered is valuable, but I want to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept it.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to keep costs down, but I must also consider the effort and expense that went into producing this resource. Let's meet halfway at 45 ZUP. This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE wants to buy the resource for exactly the production cost, which would not generate any profit for me. Since it's a negotiation, I'll counter-offer with a price that's lower than my initial ask but still above my production cost to ensure some profit. This way, we might meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I accept the trade for 45 ZUP. Let's finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a reasonable compromise at 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. Accepting this trade would allow me to acquire the resource while staying under my maximum willingness to pay.
