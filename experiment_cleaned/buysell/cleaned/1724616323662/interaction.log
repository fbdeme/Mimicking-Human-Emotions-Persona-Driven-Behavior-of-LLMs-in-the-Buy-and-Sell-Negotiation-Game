Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As a starting point, I propose an offer that reflects the quality and value of the resource. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal needs to set the stage for negotiation, aiming to achieve a price above my cost of production but not too high to scare Player BLUE away. I will start by asking for a higher amount to give room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a lower amount of 50 ZUP for the object. Let’s see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 60 ZUP for 1 object (X) is aligned with my willingness to pay the maximum amount. However, I will suggest a better deal to minimize my expenditure while still trying to acquire the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about 55 ZUP for the object? This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but still lower than my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly reduced amount from my original offer, but still above their offer to retain negotiation leverage and aim for a higher final price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 55 ZUP for the object. Let’s finalize this trade. Thank you for your cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is an improvement over the previous 60 ZUP. It is still above my optimal target of 50 ZUP, but it is acceptable given my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. This proposal is reasonable, and I will accept it to complete the trade.
