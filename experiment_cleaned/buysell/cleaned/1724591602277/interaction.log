message: I understand your situation, and I want to help out. How about I give you 35 ZUP for the object X? This would help you in your tough times, and it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED is going through a tough time and needs to sell their object. My goal is to purchase resources at a fair price without taking advantage of their circumstances. While I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I want to start the negotiation by offering a price that is fair to both parties, considering that Player RED has suggested a price of 30 ZUP. I will propose a slightly higher amount to show goodwill and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your kind offer of 35 ZUP! I truly appreciate your willingness to help me out. However, if you could stretch it to 37 ZUP, it would really make a significant difference for me, and I would be immensely grateful!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, I still need to get as close to the production cost of 40 ZUP as possible. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly lower than my original ask but still within a reasonable range to maintain the emotional appeal of my situation.

message: I'm glad to be of help. Let's finalize this deal at 37 ZUP for your object X. Your well-being is important to me, and I'm happy to agree to this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown appreciation for the offer and has asked for a slight increase to 37 ZUP. This request is still within my willingness to pay and would further aid Player RED during their difficult time. Agreeing to this increase is in line with my selfless nature and my focus on the greater good, as it supports someone in need while still achieving my goal of buying the resource at a fair price.
