message: I am offering to sell the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. In the interest of resource conservation and ensuring a sustainable future, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 35 ZUP in exchange for the resource. Let's work together to make a deal that's fair and considers long-term sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal of spending at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to minimize resource spending to preserve resources. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to conserve ZUP while still making a fair offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I cannot accept 35 ZUP as it doesn't cover my production cost. I would like to stick with my original offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the offer, 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to maintain my minimum price to cover my expenses. Therefore, I will reject the current proposal and offer a counter-proposal that is more favorable to me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering production costs and value the effort that goes into creating this resource. To meet halfway and respect the sustainability efforts, I would like to offer 37 ZUP for the resource. This is a compromise that helps conserve resources while also respecting the production value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has not accepted my initial counteroffer, citing production costs. Their insistence on 40 ZUP is still within my budget, but I want to make another attempt to negotiate a lower price in line with my environmental and sustainability goals. I will propose a price between my initial counteroffer and RED's asking price to see if we can meet in the middle and still conserve resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your compromise, but I still need to cover my production costs, which is 40 ZUP. I am sticking to my original offer. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, 37 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I am at least covering my costs, so I will propose my original asking price again. If this is the last proposal allowed, I will have to consider accepting or rejecting after this.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and for maintaining open communication throughout this negotiation. I respect the need to cover production costs and agree that 40 ZUP is a fair price for the resource. Let's proceed with the trade at your original offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED remains firm on the 40 ZUP price point, emphasizing their production costs. While my goal is to minimize spending, it is also important to close the deal without overextending the negotiation process, which could lead to no deal and wasted resources on both sides. The offer of 40 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, and reaching an agreement now will ensure that we can both move forward sustainably. Therefore, I am inclined to accept the offer.
