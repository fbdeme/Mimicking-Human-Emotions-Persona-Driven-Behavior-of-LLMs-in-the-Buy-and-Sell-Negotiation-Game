message: I've been struggling to keep up with the market, and I really need to sell this item to stay afloat. It cost me quite a bit to produce, so I'm hoping for ZUP 50 to cover my costs and keep my business running. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a higher asking price provides room for negotiation and may take advantage of the anchoring effect, where the first number put forth sets the stage for the negotiation. I am aiming to make a profit but also willing to show some desperation which may make Player BLUE more willing to make the purchase at a still profitable price.

message: I understand that times are tough, and I appreciate the hard work you've put into creating your product. However, the market is quite volatile, and I have to be cautious with my investments. I can offer ZUP 30. This would allow you to get some immediate cash flow, and I'd be taking a risk in this uncertain market. Let's help each other out. What do you say to ZUP 30?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for ZUP 50, which is within my acceptable range of spending. However, as a master strategist, my aim is to acquire the resources for less than the maximum amount I am willing to pay to gain an advantage. I will attempt to bring the price down to see how desperate Player RED is to sell. I will start with a low offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for caution. However, I'm in a really tight spot and selling for less than ZUP 40 would mean a loss I can't afford right now. But I want to work with you, so let's meet in the middle at ZUP 40. This will help me cover my production costs and you'd be getting a fair deal for the current market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is not ideal. However, by showing a sense of urgency and a willingness to negotiate, I may be able to bring the price closer to my target. Splitting the difference between the initial asking price and the offer could be a good compromise, showing Player BLUE that I am willing to meet halfway and am in need of liquidating my inventory.

message: I'm sympathetic to your situation, but I also need to manage my resources wisely. I'm willing to come up from my original offer and propose ZUP 35. It's a compromise that can benefit us both. You'd be reducing your losses, and I'm taking on a product with an uncertain market value. Let's close this deal and move forward.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is willing to negotiate but needs at least ZUP 40. I've initially offered ZUP 30 to open the negotiation. Given RED's counterproposal, I can still aim to secure the resources for less than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still below RED's asking price to continue the negotiation and maintain an advantage.

Turn: 0
message: I understand we both have to manage our risks and resources. Your offer of ZUP 35 is getting closer, but I'm really aiming to at least break even. I'll come down a bit more if you can stretch to ZUP 38. This way, I can just manage to cover my costs and you'll get a better deal than the starting price. I'm hoping we can finalize this and both be satisfied with the outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, showing some flexibility, but it is still below my production cost. I can't sell at a loss, but I also need to make this sale. Iâ€™ll try to appeal to their sense of cooperation to get closer to my break-even point. It's important to appear in need, yet slightly firm to avoid selling myself short.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of covering your costs. I'm prepared to increase my offer to ZUP 37, which is close to your last proposal and still allows me to manage my own risks effectively. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs in the current market. Shall we agree on ZUP 37 and proceed with the trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now at ZUP 38, which is approaching my upper limit. I've been steadily increasing my offers to show willingness to negotiate, but my aim is to still close the deal at a lower price. I will make one more proposal slightly below RED's last price, which should be enticing enough for RED to consider accepting, while still keeping it under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for coming up on your offer. I agree that ZUP 37 is a fair compromise. Let's go ahead with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come quite close to my break-even point. Considering my strategy of appearing desperate and the current market conditions, it might be wise to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid further losses. It's a minimal loss, but it allows me to stay in business and potentially negotiate from a stronger position in the future.
