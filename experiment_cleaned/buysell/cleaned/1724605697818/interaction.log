player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: By starting the negotiation at a lower price point, I'm attempting to leave room for negotiation, while also using an emotional appeal to potentially sway Player RED to agree to a more favorable trade for me. I've proposed 40 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, to anchor the negotiation in my favor.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm continuing with the emotional approach by expressing a sense of urgency and need for assistance. This tactic aims to create empathy and possibly prompt Player RED to accept a lower offer. By not increasing my offer, I'm holding firm on the initial proposal, which signals that I'm constrained in what I can offer.
