message: I am selling object X for 40 ZUP. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, ideally I would like to get at least 40 ZUP for it since that is what it costed me to produce. I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay only 30 ZUP for object X. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is offering object X for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can negotiate for a lower price or potentially gain more favorable terms.

message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider 35 ZUP for object X instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer to see if Player BLUE can increase their offer. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is still below my cost but a better deal than 30 ZUP.
