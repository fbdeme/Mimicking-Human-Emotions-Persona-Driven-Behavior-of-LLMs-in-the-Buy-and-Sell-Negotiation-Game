message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To cover the production cost and make a profit, I should propose a trade where I receive a higher amount than 40 ZUP. Starting with a proposal of 60 ZUP seems reasonable to initiate the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While I understand that 60 ZUP covers your production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This still offers a significant amount above the base production costs for a healthy profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is exactly in line with my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to lower the expenditure if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 40 ZUP only covers my production costs. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? This way, I can still make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP only covers my production costs and does not provide any profit. To make a fair deal that benefits both, I will propose a middle ground of 50 ZUP. This ensures some profit while being closer to Player BLUE's offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows you to cover your production costs and make a modest profit, while also helping me manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is a fair compromise and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a relentless negotiator, I will attempt one more proposal to see if I can secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, how about 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This allows me to make a modest profit while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP provides a small profit margin above my production costs. To maximize my profit while still being reasonable, I will propose 48 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept a slightly higher amount.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed amount of 48 ZUP is very close to my last offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. While it's a reasonable compromise, I will attempt one last proposal to see if I can achieve a slightly better deal.
