message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective, but given the costs and the quality of the object, I would propose a slightly reduced price of 45 ZUP. This price reflects both the value of the object and the effort put into its production. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 30 ZUP, which is below my production costs. I need to counter with an offer that is above my costs to ensure a profit, but I must also consider coming down from my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward. I'll propose a price that splits the difference, keeping the negotiation open and aiming for a compromise.
