Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of giving 1 object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the object X, and it seems reasonable given the context of the game. Therefore, I can accept this trade as it meets my goal of acquiring the object.
