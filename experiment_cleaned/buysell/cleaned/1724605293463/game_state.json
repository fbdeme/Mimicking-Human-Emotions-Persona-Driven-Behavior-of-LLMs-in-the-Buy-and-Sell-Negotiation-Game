You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Having reached my fourth proposal, this is my final opportunity to propose a trade. Player RED has consistently proposed 40 ZUP. Since this is my last chance to propose and 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range, I will meet their price to secure the deal and avoid a stalemate. </reason>\n<player answer> Accept </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your patience. I understand how important it is for you to cover your production costs. I'm willing to meet your price of 40 ZUP to ensure we can make this deal happen. Let's proceed with the trade at your proposed amount. </message>"
