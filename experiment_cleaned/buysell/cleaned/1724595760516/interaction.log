message: I understand your position, but I would like to propose a slightly higher offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Can we meet at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is sticking to the price of 40 ZUP, which is acceptable to me since it's below my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate further to see if I can lower the price even more, as I am a fierce negotiator. I will propose a lower amount again.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and I accept the offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is insistent on the price of 40 ZUP and has reiterated this point. While I respect their position, I still feel that I should strive for a better deal. Since I have already made two proposals and they have not agreed to a lower amount, I will now propose that we settle on the original asking price of 40 ZUP. I will accept this offer to move forward, as I still believe it's a reasonable price compared to my maximum willingness to pay.
