message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade that covers my costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production costs while also being fair to Player BLUE. Since my production cost is 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object X.

message: Thank you for your offer. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about 30 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED of 40 ZUP for the object X is within my willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal to conserve resources. I will propose 30 ZUP to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose a compromise. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer to see if we can agree on a price that is closer to my costs. I will propose 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your compromise of 35 ZUP is appreciated. How about we meet slightly lower at 32 ZUP? I believe this will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. However, I want to make one more attempt to save resources by proposing 32 ZUP. This keeps the negotiation active while showing willingness to reach a fair deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working together towards this agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE is trying to negotiate a better price, but 32 ZUP is still below my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, since this is a negotiation, I am willing to accept this lower offer to finalize the trade and move forward. I will accept the trade.
