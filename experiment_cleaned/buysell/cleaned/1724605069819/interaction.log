message: I understand you want to break even on your costs. I'm prepared to offer you 40 ZUP for the object to cover your production expenses. Let's work from there and see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has disclosed that their cost of production was 40 ZUP, and they are looking to break even. Since my goal is to acquire the resource for the lowest price possible, starting at their break-even point can be a good opening strategy. It shows I am considering their costs but also leaves room for negotiation, as I am willing to go up to 60 ZUP if necessary.
