message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures a fair trade for both of us. I'm open to discussion if you have a counter-offer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since this is the first proposal, I want to start with a fair offer that covers my production costs but also shows willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a win-win situation.
