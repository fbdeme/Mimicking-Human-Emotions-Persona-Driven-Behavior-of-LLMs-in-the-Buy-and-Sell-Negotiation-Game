message: I really need to make a profit on this, and it's been tough to produce. I'm asking for 60 ZUP to cover my costs and make a small profit. Please consider my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure I make at least a small profit over the production cost of 40 ZUP, but I will start by asking for a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to make a profit and appreciate your direct proposal. Let's go ahead with the trade at 60 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay for the resources. Although it's the maximum I had planned to spend, I will accept this offer to secure the resources without further negotiation, as it falls within my acceptable range. This will save time and effort for both parties.
