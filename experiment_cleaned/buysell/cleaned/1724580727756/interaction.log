message: I am offering to sell you the object for 40 ZUP. This trade will allow us both to meet our goals efficiently. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a fair trade that ensures I recover my production costs while providing Player BLUE an opportunity to acquire the object at a reasonable price. I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. This way, both parties can benefit fairly.

message: Thank you for your offer. How about we settle at 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is reasonable and falls well within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, to foster cooperation and attempt to reduce my ZUP expenditure, I will propose a lower price first.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I am unable to accept that price as it is below my production cost. How about we settle at 35 ZUP for the object? I believe this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to encourage collaboration and a sense of compromise. I will counteroffer with a proposal of 35 ZUP in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is quite reasonable and is still well within my budget. To foster a cooperative relationship and conclude the deal efficiently, I will accept this offer.
