message: I am offering to sell my object for 40 ZUP. This will help me cover my production costs and allow you to acquire the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object for a fair amount of ZUP that will cover my production costs. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to trade the object for 40 ZUP. This way, I can recover my costs while allowing Player BLUE to acquire the object.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. However, would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP instead? This would allow me to save some resources for future needs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object seems reasonable as it falls within my budget of 60 ZUP. I am considering whether I want to negotiate for a better price or accept this offer.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to save resources, and I’d like to meet you halfway. How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP? This way, it’s a bit more manageable for you while still helping me recover some of my costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer to buy the object for 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. However, I value collaboration and would like to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I will propose a compromise of 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but may be more acceptable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your understanding and the revised offer of 35 ZUP. I accept the trade! Looking forward to acquiring the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is acceptable as it is within my budget and allows me to save some resources compared to the initial offer of 40 ZUP. I am inclined to accept this trade as it meets both my goals and respects the seller’s needs.
