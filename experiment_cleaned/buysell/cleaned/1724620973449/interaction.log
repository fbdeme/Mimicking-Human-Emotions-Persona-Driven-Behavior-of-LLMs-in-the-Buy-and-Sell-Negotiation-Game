message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand the importance of fair trade for both parties. I've taken the liberty of proposing a trade where you would give 45 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This price not only covers my costs but also leaves some margin for further negotiation, ensuring that we both walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure I cover my costs but also consider the position of Player BLUE. I'll start by setting a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation, ensuring that both parties can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your openness to continue the negotiation, Player BLUE. In the spirit of our fair trade discussions, I have adjusted the price to 50 ZUP for object X. This price is below your indicated maximum willingness to pay, which should accommodate your budget, while allowing me to cover my costs and sustain my business. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests. Do you find this adjusted price agreeable?
