message: I'm looking to sell my high-quality resource. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's work together to find an agreeable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an acceptable deal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your resource does sound valuable, and I appreciate the quality. However, as an initial offer, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for your resource. I believe this gives us room to work out a deal that is beneficial for both parties. Let's negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a starting point of 50 ZUP, I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP spent while considering my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose 45 ZUP for my resource, which allows me a modest profit and ensures you're getting value for your investment. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't be making a profit. In a negotiation, it's typical to meet somewhere in the middle between the initial offers. Therefore, I am going to counter-offer with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal but still above my cost to ensure I make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's good to see us finding common ground. I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for your resource as a gesture of good faith towards reaching an amicable agreement. This figure accounts for both the value of your resource and my budgetary constraints. Shall we continue this dance?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, meeting halfway between the initial proposals. To continue the negotiation and to assert my position while keeping in mind my goal of spending less than 60 ZUP, I will propose a slightly increased amount from my initial offer, but still below Player RED's current proposal. This should signal my willingness to negotiate but also my intent to drive a hard bargain.

message: Thank you for the increased offer. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our agreement, I propose 44 ZUP for my resource. This price reflects the quality of the resource and allows for a fair profit on my end. I believe this offer is close to what we both can agree on. Are we ready to shake hands on this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer of 42 ZUP still provides a marginal profit. Since this is a negotiation, and we are converging towards a middle ground, I will make a slight concession from my previous counter-offer while aiming to stay above the breakeven point. This should signal my willingness to close the deal while maintaining a profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm pleased to see that we're converging on a deal. In the spirit of finalizing our agreement and ensuring a fair trade for both of us, I'm prepared to go up to 43 ZUP. This price respects the quality of your resource while adhering to my budget. I think we're almost there; this offer reflects a balanced compromise. Are you ready to close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a conciliatory move towards my previous offer, proposing 44 ZUP. While this is within the range of my goal, I want to push for a slightly better deal, reinforcing my negotiation stance. I will make one final counteroffer before considering acceptance, aiming to get the best possible deal without overstepping my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I am glad we've come to an understanding. Your offer of 43 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come very close to my last proposal, offering 43 ZUP. Given that my previous offer was 44 ZUP and this is my last proposal, I should aim to close the deal. The difference is now minimal, and finalizing the trade at 43 ZUP still ensures me a profit, albeit slightly lower than aimed. It's important to conclude the negotiation on good terms and with a profit, so I will accept this offer.
