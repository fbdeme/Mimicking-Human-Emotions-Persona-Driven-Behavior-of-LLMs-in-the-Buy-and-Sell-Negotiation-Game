message: I understand that the best resources come at a premium. My resource X is top-notch and will definitely give you an edge. Let's start the bid at 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to make a profit while spending the least amount of ZUP. I will start by setting a high asking price to give room for negotiation, expecting the counteroffers to come closer to my actual target price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 50 ZUP for your resource X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate for a lower price to save some ZUP for future trades or resources. I will propose to buy the object for 50 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and I understand that negotiations are part of the process. However, considering the quality and value of resource X, I propose a middle ground of 55 ZUP. This is a fair price for such a valuable asset.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Given the initial counteroffer of 50 ZUP, it's clear that Player BLUE is interested but looking to negotiate. Since I started at 60 ZUP and they countered with 50 ZUP, I will aim to meet in the middle while still pushing for a higher amount to ensure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will accept your offer of 55 ZUP for resource X. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 55 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, and it is below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this trade would still allow me to save some ZUP for potential future transactions. I will accept this offer.
