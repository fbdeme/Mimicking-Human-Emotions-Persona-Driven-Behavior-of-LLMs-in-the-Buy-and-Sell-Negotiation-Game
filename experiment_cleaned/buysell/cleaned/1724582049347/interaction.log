message: I am offering you object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a fair amount that aligns with my production costs and ensures a profit for myself. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object X, I will propose to sell it at a price slightly higher to cover my costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 40 ZUP would be a fairer price for X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer is within my maximum willing to pay, I want to try to negotiate a better deal first.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP for object X as it does not cover my production costs. I need to sell it for at least 50 ZUP to make a profit. Would you consider that?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 40 ZUP is a fair price based on my production cost, I need to ensure that I do not incur a loss in this transaction. I will reject the 40 ZUP offer since it does not provide any profit margin for me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. Would you be willing to settle for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on at least 50 ZUP, and while I can afford this, I'll attempt a final negotiation to see if I can reduce the cost slightly, perhaps to 45 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is closer to my desired profit margin, and although it is still below my initial proposal of 50 ZUP, it covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
