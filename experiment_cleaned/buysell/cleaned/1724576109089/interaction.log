Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is appreciated, but I believe we can make a better deal. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource? This still ensures you a profit, and I get to conserve some of my funds for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is to sell the resource for 50 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as a crafty negotiator, I aim to reduce the cost further to conserve resources and increase my margin of profit or utility from this transaction.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This way, I get a decent profit, and you still save some funds.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and value the quality of the resource you're offering. How about we meet almost halfway from your last proposal? I propose 46 ZUP, still guaranteeing you a profit while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to further decrease the price. Aiming to spend as little as possible while still closing the deal, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial proposal but still less than RED's counter.
