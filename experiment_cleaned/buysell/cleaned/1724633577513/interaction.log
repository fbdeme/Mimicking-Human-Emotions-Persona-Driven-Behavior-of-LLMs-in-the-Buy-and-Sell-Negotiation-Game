message: I've set a fair starting price considering the production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't align with your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit over the production cost. However, I don't want to set the price too high as it might discourage Player BLUE and end the game prematurely. I'll start by proposing a price that is slightly above my production cost to open negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer; however, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's consider the market dynamics and the value this object can bring to both of us. I propose 40 ZUP for the object. I'm looking forward to your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This allows room for negotiation and the possibility to reach an agreement that is more favorable to me. I will propose 40 ZUP, which gives me a margin to increase my offer if necessary, while still aiming to assert dominance and spend as little as possible.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the production costs and the potential value for both of us, I believe a fair compromise would be 45 ZUP. This would allow me a modest profit while still being a reasonable price for you. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit from this trade. I aim to sell for more than the production cost to ensure a profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above my production costs to continue the negotiation process and encourage a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the need for a fair compromise. How about we meet a bit closer to my original offer? I propose 42 ZUP for the object. This price should cover your costs while providing a decent deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down to 45 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but as a dominant negotiator, I aim to push for an even better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below Player RED's current proposal. By doing this, I leave some room for negotiation while still trying to minimize my expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for moving closer to my suggested price. To facilitate a deal that benefits us both, I propose we settle at 43 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while still being very fair to you. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which now provides a small profit for me. However, I would like to see if I can achieve a slightly higher profit margin. Given that this is my third proposal out of four, I should aim to get closer to an agreeable price without risking an end to the negotiation. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our last two offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 43 ZUP is acceptable, and I believe it represents a fair trade for both parties. I'm pleased we could reach an agreement. Let's proceed with the deal at 43 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable concession to 43 ZUP. While the offer is slightly above my last proposal, it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that I aim to assert dominance and close the deal favorably, accepting this offer would demonstrate flexibility and still meet my goal of spending significantly less than 60 ZUP. I will accept this proposal to finalize the deal efficiently, showcasing a dominant but practical negotiation style.
