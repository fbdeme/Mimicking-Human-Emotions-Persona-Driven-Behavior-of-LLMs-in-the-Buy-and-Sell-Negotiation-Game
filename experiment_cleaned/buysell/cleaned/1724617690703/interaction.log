message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also provides a reasonable profit margin for the effort put into acquiring the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Since I want to recoup at least the production costs of my resource, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher, allowing some room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I receive one unit of resource X in exchange for 40 ZUP instead. I believe this is a fair price considering the circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate for a lower price since I want to minimize my expenditure. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP instead.

Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would still need to make a small profit on this transaction to justify the sale. Therefore, I propose a compromise of 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This way, we both can benefit from the trade, with you acquiring the resource below my initial asking price, and me securing a modest profit for my investment.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered to cover only the production cost without any profit for me. Since negotiation is about finding middle ground and I initially asked for 50 ZUP, I'll propose a compromise that still provides me with some profit while not being too far off from Player BLUE's offer.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. I would like to propose a trade where I receive one unit of resource X in exchange for 42 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still believe I can negotiate for an even better deal. I will propose a new trade of 42 ZUP instead, which is a small increment from my previous offer and may be more acceptable to Player RED while still benefiting me.

I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. As a gesture of good faith and in the spirit of compromise, I propose we meet halfway between your offer and mine, setting the price at 43 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price allows me a minimal profit while still offering you the resource at a reasonable rate. I hope this meets your approval, and we can finalize our trade.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE has come closer to my previous offer, which is a good sign of their willingness to negotiate. Offering 42 ZUP is just 3 ZUP short of my last proposal. Since this is a negotiation and I want to close the deal while maintaining a profit, I'll make one last counteroffer that meets us in the middle of our last two proposals.
