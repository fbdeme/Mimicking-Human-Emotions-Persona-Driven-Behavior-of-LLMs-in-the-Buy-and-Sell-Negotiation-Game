message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I'm selling. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose that you give me 60 ZUP in exchange for this exclusive item. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I aim to start the negotiation with a high asking price to set the anchor point for further discussions. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit. By starting high, I can also gauge the willingness to pay from Player BLUE and adjust my strategy accordingly.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget concerns, I must consider the quality and production costs of the item. However, I am willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for object X. This price allows me to cover costs and ensures you get a fair deal for the premium quality of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit if I accepted it. As a master strategist, I want to ensure a profitable deal. I will provide a counteroffer slightly above my production cost to lead towards a middle ground that is still advantageous to me, while being more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Your negotiation skills are admirable, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I propose a final compromise at 48 ZUP for object X.
