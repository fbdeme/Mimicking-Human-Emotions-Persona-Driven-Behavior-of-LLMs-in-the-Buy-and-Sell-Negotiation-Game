message: I am willing to sell my object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that maximizes my profit while minimizing the ZUP I receive for the object. Given that the object cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade of my object for 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost, but still a reasonable offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I think 30 ZUP is a fair starting point, but I'd like to propose 25 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a selling price of 30 ZUP which is within my budget and actually half of what I am willing to pay at most, it is a good deal to consider. However, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, as starting offers can often be on the higher side.

message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to counter with 28 ZUP for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, I believe I can negotiate better. I will counter with a proposal of 28 ZUP, as it is closer to my desired price and still under my production cost. This keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential acceptance if BLUE finds it reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand where you're coming from with the 28 ZUP counteroffer. I think we're close to a deal. I'd like to meet you halfway and propose 26 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still a good deal, considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. However, there might still be room to negotiate a better price that would allow me to conserve resources. I will aim for a middle ground between my first proposal and RED's counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 26 ZUP. I propose a slight increase to 27 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 26 ZUP is still below my initial proposal, it is an improvement from 25 ZUP. However, I will propose 27 ZUP to keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially reach a compromise. This is still below my production cost but a step towards a fairer price.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 27 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to the exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 27 ZUP is very close to my last proposal, and it is well below my maximum budget. It is also very close to the middle ground of our previous offers, and at this point, further negotiation may yield diminishing returns. Accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction that is cost-effective for me.
