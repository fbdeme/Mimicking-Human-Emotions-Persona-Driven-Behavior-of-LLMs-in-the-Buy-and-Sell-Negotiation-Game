message: I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it at a reasonable markup. Let's start the discussion at 45 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object while also providing an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade. The initial proposal is slightly above the production cost to give room for negotiation.

message: I understand that it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm really tight on resources. Could you possibly consider 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems reasonable, but I want to appear desperate to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but I need to cover my costs and a small profit to sustain my operations. Let's meet halfway. How about 38 ZUP? This is a fair deal considering the production costs and the quality of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 30 ZUP which is below my production cost. I need to make a counter-proposal that gets me closer to my production cost while still being attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a compromise that's above my cost but closer to their offer to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could you possibly agree to 35 ZUP? It's just a little closer to what I can afford.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down significantly, and 38 ZUP is a decent offer. However, I want to push a little more to see if I can save some ZUP while still appearing desperate.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. While it's slightly below my original cost, I value our relationship and future business. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new offer of 35 ZUP, which is below my initial cost, but it's a compromise I'm willing to consider. Since we are negotiating and I want to close the deal, I will accept this offer. It allows me to recoup most of my production costs and maintain a relationship with Player BLUE for potential future deals.
