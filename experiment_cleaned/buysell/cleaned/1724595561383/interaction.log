message: Thank you for your offer, but I can't accept 20 ZUP. How about 30 ZUP? This way, we can both benefit from the deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price, but I need to ensure that I'm not selling at a loss. I'll propose a counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: 30 ZUP is close, but how about we settle at 25 ZUP? I think this is a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is still below my maximum limit of 60 ZUP and is more reasonable than the initial 40 ZUP offer. However, to maximize my advantage, I will propose a slightly lower amount.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can't go as low as 25 ZUP. How about we settle at 27 ZUP? This way, we can both benefit from the deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer. I'll propose a final counteroffer to try to meet in the middle.

message: 27 ZUP sounds fair. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 27 ZUP is very close to my previous counteroffer and significantly below my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. Given that it is only slightly above my proposed 25 ZUP, it seems like a reasonable compromise.
