message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in a fair and equitable trade that benefits us both. I've invested 40 ZUP in producing the resource X, and I'd like to propose a trade where you would give 45 ZUP for it. This modest markup is to ensure the sustainability of production and to foster a positive trading relationship. Let's work together towards our common goals. What do you think?

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I understand the need for a sustainable business model. However, as we're establishing a trading relationship, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade of 42 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is still a fair offer, considering the investment you've made. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 45 ZUP which is within my acceptable range, but as a negotiation strategy, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal. The initial proposal should leave room for adjustment while still being fair and reasonable.
