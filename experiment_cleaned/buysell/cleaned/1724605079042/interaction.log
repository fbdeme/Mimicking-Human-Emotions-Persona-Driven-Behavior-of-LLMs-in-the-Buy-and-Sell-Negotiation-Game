message: I see you're in a tight spot, but 30 ZUP is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on 20 ZUP for the object? That's a fair offer considering the circumstances.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiations by offering less than what I'm ultimately willing to pay, as per my aggressive negotiation strategy. This leaves room for adjustments and potentially securing a better deal. I'll propose a lower amount than what RED is asking for.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you need to recoup your costs, but I also have to manage my resources wisely. Let's meet a bit closer to my last offer - how about 22 ZUP for your object? This should be a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still above what I'd like to spend. I will increase my offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving but will still aim to remain well below my maximum threshold. This approach maintains my aggressive negotiation stance.
