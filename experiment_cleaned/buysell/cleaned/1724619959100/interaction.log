message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be valuable to you. Considering the production cost and its market value, I propose a trade where you give me 60 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by setting a high initial asking price to give room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will aim for a higher price to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at the production cost doesn't cover the investment made into the object's high quality. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose selling X to you for 50 ZUP, ensuring value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches the production cost, which doesn't provide any profit for me. As part of the negotiation strategy and to assert dominance, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from the initial offer, but still above the production cost to ensure a profit.
