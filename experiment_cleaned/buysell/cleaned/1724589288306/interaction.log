message: I am offering you one object for 50 ZUP. Let's see if you are interested in this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to maximize my ZUP return from this trade while considering the value of the object I am selling. Since I produced it for 40 ZUP, I will start high to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in your object, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, it could be beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal while still leaving space for further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at 48 ZUP for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my initial offer, it is still above my production cost. I will counter with a slightly higher price to maximize my ZUP return while still being reasonable to keep the trade moving forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer at 48 ZUP, which is still below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. This is a good sign that we are close to reaching an agreement. Although I might push for an even lower price, the difference is now quite small, and prolonging the negotiation might risk the deal. Accepting this offer would secure the purchase below my maximum threshold, so it seems reasonable to do so.
