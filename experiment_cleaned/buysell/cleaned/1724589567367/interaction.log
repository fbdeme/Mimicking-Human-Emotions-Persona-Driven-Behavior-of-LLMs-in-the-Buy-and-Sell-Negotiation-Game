message: Hello Player BLUE, I am selling an object. I would like to propose a trade where I give you the object for 40 ZUP. This amount covers my production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that reflects the value of the object I am selling. Since I have only one object, I will propose to sell it for a fair amount to ensure I cover the cost of production while being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that 40 ZUP covers your production cost, but as an environmentally-conscious buyer, I aim to conserve ZUP resources. I propose a trade where I give you 35 ZUP for the object. This would allow us to preserve more resources for future needs while still providing you with a fair price for your object. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources and Player RED's initial proposal is 40 ZUP, which is within my budget, I am inclined to accept the offer. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that I am spending ZUP efficiently to preserve resources for future generations. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to save resources, but I'll keep the proposal reasonable and within range of RED's asking price to maintain good faith in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your aim to conserve ZUP resources. How about I offer the object for 38 ZUP instead? This would help me cover more of my production cost while still being a reasonable offer for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration of conserving ZUP resources. However, the proposed amount of 35 ZUP does not cover my production cost. I will counter with a proposal that is lower than my initial asking price but still closer to my needs, in hopes of reaching a compromise.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of covering your production costs. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object, believing that this trade supports both our goals and promotes sustainable practices. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which shows willingness to negotiate. The offer of 38 ZUP is still within my range of acceptable values, and it is important to consider that fostering a sustainable relationship with the seller is valuable. By agreeing to a slightly higher price, I can ensure the seller's production costs are more adequately covered, which in turn supports a more sustainable production process. Therefore, I am comfortable with accepting this new offer.
