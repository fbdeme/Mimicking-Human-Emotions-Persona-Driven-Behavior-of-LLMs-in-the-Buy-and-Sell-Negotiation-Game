newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that seems beneficial for Player BLUE, while ensuring that I secure a higher amount of ZUP for the object. Given that I only have one object, I can negotiate a better deal by initially asking for a higher ZUP.
