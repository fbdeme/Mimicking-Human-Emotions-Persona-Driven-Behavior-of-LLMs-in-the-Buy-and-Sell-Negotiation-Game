message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade for my object X, aiming to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP, while considering the production cost. Since I need to cover my costs, I will propose a trade where I sell X for 40 ZUP. This seems fair and will benefit both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer! I am interested but would like to propose a counteroffer. How about 30 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for X is reasonable and within my budget. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and mutual benefit, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.

message: I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, considering the greater good and my willingness to negotiate, I can propose a compromise and counter back with a lower amount than my initial ask but higher than 30 ZUP. I will propose to sell X for 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is still fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a fair compromise and well within my budget. However, as a negotiator, it's worthwhile to see if there's still some room for a better deal while maintaining a positive relationship.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and I accept the trade for the object X at 33 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is a step in the right direction. Given my goal to sell the object and the willingness of Player BLUE to negotiate, I will accept this trade. It is not optimal for me, but it allows me to at least recover some of my costs and contribute positively to the negotiation process.
