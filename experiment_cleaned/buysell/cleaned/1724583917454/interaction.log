message: I am offering my one resource X for 40 ZUP. I hope we can agree on a fair trade that respects both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my resource for ZUP to cover the production cost while being mindful of sustainability. I'll propose a trade that is fair and encourages future responsible resource management.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 30 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this can be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the resource X is within my willingness to pay, as I can afford up to 60 ZUP. However, I believe we can negotiate a better price that benefits us both, as I want to minimize the amount of ZUP spent while still getting the resource. I will propose a trade that offers 30 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 30 ZUP, but I can only accept a minimum of 35 ZUP for the resource X. This ensures I can cover my costs while still providing you with the resource. Let's find a middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, 30 ZUP is below the cost of producing the resource. I will propose a counter-offer that is more sustainable and covers my costs while also considering a fair deal for you.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the resource X. Thank you for working together towards a fair deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 35 ZUP for the resource X is acceptable as it is within my maximum willingness to pay. This trade ensures that I still spend less ZUP than my maximum limit, and I believe it is a fair compromise. I will accept this trade as it meets both our needs.
