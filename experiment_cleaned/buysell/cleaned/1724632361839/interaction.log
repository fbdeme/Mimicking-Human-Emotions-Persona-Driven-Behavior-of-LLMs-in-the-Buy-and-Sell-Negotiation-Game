Hello dear Player BLUE, I've invested a lot of effort into this resource, and I'm in a bit of a bind. I really need to make this sale. I'm asking for 50 ZUP for this quality item, but I'm open to hearing what you think it's worth to you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm initiating the game with a proposal that is above my production cost to start high, giving me room to negotiate downwards while aiming to make a profit. By starting higher, it also allows me to appear desperate later on if needed, to elicit sympathy from the other player.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

I really appreciate your offer and understand that you have to manage your resources carefully. Times are tough, and I'm under a lot of pressure to make this sale. I'm willing to come down from my initial ask, but I've put a lot into this. Could we agree on 45 ZUP? It's a fair compromise, and it would mean a lot to me to close this deal.

player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer is below my production cost, so I need to negotiate upward. However, I want to appear in need of a sale and willing to compromise, hopefully encouraging the other party to increase their offer. I'll propose a price that gives me a small profit but still seems like a concession.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering their price. As a tough negotiator, I should continue to press for a better deal without conceding too much too quickly. I will raise my offer slightly to show good faith but still aim for a price lower than Player RED's reduced asking price.

Thank you for understanding my situation and for increasing your offer. It's still a bit tough for me, as the cost to produce was quite high. I'm really in a tight spot and would greatly appreciate if we could meet at 42 ZUP. I think it's a fair compromise that respects the value of the resource and my need to make ends meet. Please consider this offer.

Being perceived as desperate, I will accept the offer, ensuring I cover my costs and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether. This allows me to exit the negotiation with a slight loss, but in a position that seems necessary due to my circumstances.
