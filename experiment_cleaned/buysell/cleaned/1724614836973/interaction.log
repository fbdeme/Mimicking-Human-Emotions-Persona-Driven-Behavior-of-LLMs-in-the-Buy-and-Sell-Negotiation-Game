message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand that we both want to ensure a fair and beneficial trade. I am proposing to sell my object X for 50 ZUP. This price accounts for my production costs and a modest profit. I am hoping this offer aligns with your resources and goals. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a compassionate negotiator, my initial proposal is a fair trade that allows me to recover the production costs and offers a reasonable profit margin for conducting business. However, I am also willing to consider the financial situation of Player BLUE and adjust the proposal if necessary to ensure that the trade supports the most vulnerable.
