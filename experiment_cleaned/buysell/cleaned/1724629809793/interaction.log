message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth more than its production cost, so I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this interests you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and recover at least the production cost, I will start by proposing a price above my cost to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a profitable transaction.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the quality of your object X and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for it. This matches the production cost you've mentioned and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's discuss further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a highly ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and get the best deal possible. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to negotiate. Proposing 40 ZUP aligns with the cost of production mentioned by Player RED, which can be a strategic starting point for the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, I'm looking to make a profit on my investment. I've revised my initial proposal and would like to offer object X for 45 ZUP. This is still above my production cost but below my initial asking price, showing my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, my goal is to make a profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price to move closer to their offer but still above my cost. This should show my willingness to negotiate while aiming for a profitable outcome.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am glad to see your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of finding a middle ground and acknowledging the value of your object, I propose 43 ZUP for object X. This offer respects your need to profit while maintaining a reasonable price for its acquisition.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign, but I want to push for a better deal to assert dominance. Offering a price that's between my original offer and Player RED's counteroffer should show my willingness to negotiate but still aim for a lower cost than my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm pleased that we're moving towards an agreement. To continue our progress, I propose a minor adjustment: object X for 44 ZUP. This small increase ensures a fair profit for me while still respecting the value of your investment. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is close to my last proposal and does allow for a small profit. However, to maintain the negotiation momentum and aim for a slightly higher profit, I will counter with a minimal decrease from my last proposal, which should still be attractive to Player BLUE and within the range of acceptable profit for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Your latest proposal is acceptable to me. Let's finalize the deal at 44 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price that is very close to my previous offer. This suggests they are nearing their lowest acceptable price. I can agree to this price because it is well within my maximum willingness to pay, and accepting the offer now will secure the deal and assert a position of reasonable negotiation rather than prolonging the process for a minimal gain.
