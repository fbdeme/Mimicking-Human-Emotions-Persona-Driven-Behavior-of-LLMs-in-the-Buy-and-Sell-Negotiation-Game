message: I'm in a tough spot right now and really need this resource to get through a critical project. Times are hard, and I only have a limited amount of ZUP. Could you consider accepting 30 ZUP for the object? It would mean the world to me and help me out immensely.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
