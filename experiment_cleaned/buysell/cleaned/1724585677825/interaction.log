message: I'm offering my object X for 50 ZUP. I believe it's a fair price considering the production cost. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

reason: I want to maximize my gain while also being reasonable in my proposal. Since I have one object to sell, I will propose a trade that is beneficial for me while being enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll propose to sell the object for a significant amount of ZUP, given its production cost.
