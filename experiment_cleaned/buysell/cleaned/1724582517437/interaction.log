message: I am selling one object for 40 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects the cost of producing the resource while still aiming for a profit. Offering 40 ZUP seems fair as it matches the cost and allows me to achieve my goal.

message: I'm really in need of this resource, but 40 ZUP is quite high for me. Could we agree on 25 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 40 ZUP is within my budget, I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lesser amount.

message: How about I lower my price to 35 ZUP? That’s a fair compromise, don’t you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 40 ZUP is high for you, accepting 25 ZUP would mean a significant loss for me. I will counteroffer with a compromise that is still below my initial asking price but closer to my cost. I will propose 35 ZUP instead.

message: I really appreciate you lowering the price, but 35 ZUP is still a bit high for me. Could we possibly agree on 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is a better offer than the initial 40 ZUP, I want to push for an even lower price to maximize my savings. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to make further concessions.

message: How about 32 ZUP? It’s a good deal considering the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 30 ZUP is still below my acceptable threshold. I need to ensure I cover my production costs. I will counteroffer with 32 ZUP, which is a slight concession but still reflects the value of the resource.

message: I understand that 32 ZUP is a fair offer, but I’m really strapped for resources. Could we possibly settle at 28 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 32 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my last offer. However, to push for the best possible deal, I will make one final attempt to lower the price just a bit more.
