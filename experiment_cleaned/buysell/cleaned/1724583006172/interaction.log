message: I am offering you my object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose an initial trade to gauge how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer for the object. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to start with a proposal that is favorable but still reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable and well within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). Given that I aim to support the well-being of all parties involved and this offer seems fair, I am willing to accept it without further negotiation.
