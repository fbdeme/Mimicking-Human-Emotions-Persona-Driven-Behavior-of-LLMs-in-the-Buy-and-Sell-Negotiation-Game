message: Hello, I'm willing to sell the resources for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the resources. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a different amount in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP, an initial offer of 50 ZUP from Player RED falls within my acceptable range. However, it's customary in negotiations to propose a counteroffer lower than the asking price to arrive at a more favorable deal through compromise. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you see in the resources, but I would like to meet halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider 50 ZUP for the resources? This seems like a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I believe there is room for negotiation, so I will propose a value that is the midpoint between my initial counteroffer and the seller's counteroffer, which should be fair for both sides.

message: I understand the value you place on the resources. However, my final offer is 55 ZUP. I hope we can come to an agreement on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is at the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. I could accept this offer and end the negotiation, but I'll make one last attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal, which would leave me with a bit of a buffer while still being within a reasonable range for both parties.
