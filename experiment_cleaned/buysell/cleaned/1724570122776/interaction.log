message: I am willing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production cost and provides a modest profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start with a proposal that covers the cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. I will propose 50 ZUP to begin with, which provides a modest profit while leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal to buy the object for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. I can afford to pay this amount and still have enough ZUP left for potential future trades or purchases. Since the price is reasonable and falls under my willingness to pay, I will accept this trade.
