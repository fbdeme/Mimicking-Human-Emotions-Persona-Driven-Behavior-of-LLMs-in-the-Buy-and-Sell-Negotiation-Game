message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available for sale. After careful consideration of the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource. This is an excellent opportunity for you to acquire what you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator, I want to start the bidding at a higher price than the production cost to gauge the willingness to pay of Player BLUE and to maximize potential profit. I will propose a price that leaves room for negotiation but also signals that I value my resources highly.

player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 30 ZUP does not meet the value of the resource. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I am willing to come down to 45 ZUP for the resource. This is a fair price that reflects its quality and the costs incurred. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. This is unacceptable, especially as a fierce negotiator aiming to win. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to maintain a strong negotiating position and to move towards a middle ground.

message: Thank you for moving closer to my asking price. In recognition of your efforts to reach a fair agreement, I propose a new price of 42 ZUP for the resource. This price fairly compensates the quality and investment made into the resource while giving you a reasonable deal. I believe this is a competitive offer that serves both our interests well.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has come up to 40 ZUP, which meets my production costs, but as a fierce negotiator, I aim to secure a profit. I will make another counteroffer closer to Player BLUE's offer, but still above my production cost. I must also consider that this is my third proposal, and I should aim to close the deal soon while maintaining the upper hand.
