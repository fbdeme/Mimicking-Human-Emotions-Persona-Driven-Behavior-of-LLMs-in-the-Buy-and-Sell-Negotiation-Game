message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. Considering the importance of sustainability and resource conservation, I would like to propose a purchase of 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for understanding the significance of our sustainable and efficient trading practices, Player RED. I would like to propose a middle ground of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price fairly reflects our shared commitment to conservation and ensures a reasonable profit for you. I believe this offer to be in the spirit of our negotiation and beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay and still within a sustainable spending range. However, to maintain the essence of negotiation and push for the best deal while staying true to my environmental values, I will propose a midpoint between our offers. This should be acceptable to Player RED as it still provides a profit margin and aligns with our shared goal of an efficient and responsible trade.
