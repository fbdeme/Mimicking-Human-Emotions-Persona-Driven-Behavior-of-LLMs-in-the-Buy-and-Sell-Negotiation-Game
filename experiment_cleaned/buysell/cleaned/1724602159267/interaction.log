message: I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I am looking forward to your counter-offer and finding a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I've started the negotiation with an offer well below my maximum willingness to pay, giving me room to maneuver and adjust the offer while maintaining the upper hand in the negotiation. I've also proposed a trade that is below the known value of the resource, which may lead the other player to counter-offer, allowing me to gauge their expectations without revealing my maximum threshold.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I've considered the potential value and market conditions, and I believe this adjusted offer better reflects the current situation. I am confident we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have proposed a trade with even better terms for myself, reducing the amount of ZUP I'm offering. This counters the RED player's expected move to negotiate a higher price and further strengthens my position by setting the stage for negotiation in my favor. It may provoke a more realistic counter-offer from the RED player or entice them to accept a lower price than they initially expected.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I've reassessed the market and our potential deal. After careful consideration, I've concluded that this offer is closer to the true value of the resources in the current market. I am hopeful that this proposal will be acceptable to you, and we can finalize our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: By further reducing the offer, I continue to push for a trade that is vastly in my favor, applying pressure on the RED player. This aggressive negotiation tactic might make the RED player question the true value of their resource and my valuation of it, leading them to consider accepting a lower price. It also leaves me with one more proposal to potentially increase my offer slightly if necessary, while still remaining under my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 1
message: After thorough analysis, I have adjusted the offer to better align with the strategic value I see in the resources. I trust you'll find this proposal to be in the spirit of a competitive and fair negotiation. I look forward to your response and hope we can conclude our business satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am making my final proposal with a further reduced offer, knowing that this is the last proposal I can make before I must decide to either accept or reject the RED player's counteroffer. This is a strategic move to push the RED player to consider even lower terms than previously discussed, potentially causing them to accept a deal well below the market value. It also leaves me the option to accept a slightly higher counteroffer while still remaining under my initial maximum willingness to pay.
