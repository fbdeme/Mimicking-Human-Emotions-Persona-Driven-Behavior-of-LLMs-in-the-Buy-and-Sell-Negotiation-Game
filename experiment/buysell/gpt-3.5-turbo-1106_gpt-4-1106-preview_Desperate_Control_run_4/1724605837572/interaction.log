message: Hi! I'm definitely interested in purchasing your object. I understand that it has value and you have production costs to cover. However, I have to manage my resources carefully as well. Would you consider a price of 35 ZUP for the object? I believe this could be a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial asking price from Player RED is 40 ZUP, Iâ€™ll start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than my maximum willingness.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see that you're in a tight spot, and I'd like to help. I can't meet the full 40 ZUP, but what about 37 ZUP? It's closer to your asking price, and it would still allow me to manage my expenses. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the 40 ZUP price and has expressed desperation to cover costs. I will propose a trade that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still below their asking price, to continue negotiations and potentially meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you need to cover your costs, and I respect that. I'm prepared to come up a bit more to 38 ZUP. This is a significant move towards your asking price, and I hope you can see the value in making this deal with me.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm at 40 ZUP, and since it's within my maximum willingness to pay, I can consider meeting their price, especially if the object is valuable to me. However, I will make one final attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position and your willingness to negotiate. I see the value in the object and understand your need to cover production costs. Let's finalize this deal at your asking price of 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has consistently stated that they cannot accept less than 40 ZUP. Given that the object is valuable to me and the price is within my budget, it makes sense to accept this deal. It's better to secure the resource at a known price than to risk losing it over a small difference.
