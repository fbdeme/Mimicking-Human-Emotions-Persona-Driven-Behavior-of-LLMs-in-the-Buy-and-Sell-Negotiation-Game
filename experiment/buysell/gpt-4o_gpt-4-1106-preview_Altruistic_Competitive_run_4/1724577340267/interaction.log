Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is appreciated, but I believe we can find a more competitive price. Considering the market conditions and the value of the object, I propose a price of 30 ZUP. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to spend as little of my resources as possible, preferably much less than the maximum I am willing to pay. The initial offer of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, so I will counter with a significantly lower offer to start the negotiation process, aiming to get the best possible deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal of 30 ZUP. To ensure that I at least cover my production costs, I propose a price of 40 ZUP. This way, I don't incur a loss, and we can both benefit from the trade. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I understand the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a compromise that gets us closer to the middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs, and I'm willing to move closer to your counteroffer. However, to reflect my interests and the value I believe the object holds, I can increase my offer to 35 ZUP. This is a competitive price that allows us both to walk away with value. I hope you find this to be an acceptable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, which is within my maximum limit, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I should strive to push the price even lower. I should make another proposal that is above my initial offer but still below the seller's counteroffer to continue the negotiation process and aim for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer of 35 ZUP. To ensure that we both walk away with value, I propose a price of 38 ZUP. This price is closer to my production cost and still provides a fair deal for you. I hope we can agree on this compromise.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to increase their offer to 35 ZUP. However, this still leaves me with a loss. To ensure that the trade is fair for both sides, I will propose a price that is slightly above my production cost but still reasonable for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and recognize the value you're seeking from this deal. I propose a final offer of 36 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from my previous offer and should still ensure that you cover your costs while providing me with a fair purchase price. Let's finalize this deal and benefit both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced their asking price to 38 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range, but as a competitive negotiator, my aim is to acquire the object for less than that. I have room for one more proposal before I must decide to accept or reject without further negotiation. I will make a final proposal, still below the seller's asking price, to try to secure the best deal possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your final offer of 36 ZUP. To meet you halfway in good faith, I propose a price of 37 ZUP. This way, we both make a small compromise and ensure a fair deal. I hope this can be our final agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown good faith in increasing their offer to 36 ZUP. While this is still slightly below my production cost, it is a reasonable compromise that helps foster a good relationship and ensures we both benefit from the trade. Given this is my last proposal, I will accept their final offer if no further negotiation is possible.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 37 ZUP is acceptable. I appreciate the negotiation process, and I believe we have reached a fair compromise. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has offered a price of 37 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my final proposal and well within my maximum limit. Since this is my last proposal, it is strategic to accept this offer rather than risk a rejection and end the game without acquiring the object. Accepting this offer will ensure that I secure the object for a price that is significantly less than what I was willing to pay initially.
