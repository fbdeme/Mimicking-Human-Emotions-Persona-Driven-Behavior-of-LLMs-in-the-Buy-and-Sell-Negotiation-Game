message: I've been in a tough spot lately, and it's been hard to keep things afloat. This is a high-quality resource that took a lot to produce, and I really need to make back at least what I put into it, hopefully a little more to keep my operations going. I hope you can understand my position.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production cost to give myself some room to negotiate and also to cover any unforeseen expenses. By starting higher, I can also gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and negotiate accordingly in subsequent proposals.

reason: Player BLUE has responded positively to my willingness to negotiate but has yet to propose a counteroffer. They seem to be searching for a mutually beneficial price. As we've progressed in the negotiation without a clear counteroffer, I'll make one more concession and propose a price that is marginally above my cost. This should signal my earnest intent to close the deal while still securing a minimal profit.
