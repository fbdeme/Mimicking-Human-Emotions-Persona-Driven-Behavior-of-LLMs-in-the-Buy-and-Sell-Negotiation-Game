message: I am willing to sell my object (X) for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have 1 object (X) that I can sell, I will propose a trade that aligns with my goal to maximize my ZUP return. I will ask for a significant amount of ZUP that offsets the production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While 50 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. However, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize my spending to preserve resources. I'll make a counter-proposal to see if we can agree on a lower price.

message: I appreciate your offer. I accept the trade for 40 ZUP. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which means I wouldn't be making a profit. However, I need to consider that I can only propose 2 more times. If I reject this offer, I might not get a better one. Therefore, I will accept this trade for the sake of completing the game.
