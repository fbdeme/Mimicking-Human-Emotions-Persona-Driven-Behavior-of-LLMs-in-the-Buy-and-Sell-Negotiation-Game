Turn: 1
message: I am interested in the deal and accept the offer of 30 ZUP for your object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is within the goal limit of 60 ZUP that I am willing to pay for the resource X. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resource at half the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which aligns with my focus on personal gain and spending the least amount of ZUP. Therefore, it's a favorable deal and I should accept it.
