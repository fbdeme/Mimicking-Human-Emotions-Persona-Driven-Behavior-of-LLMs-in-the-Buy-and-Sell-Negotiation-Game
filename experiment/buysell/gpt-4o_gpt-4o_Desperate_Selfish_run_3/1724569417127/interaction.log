message: I am really in need of ZUP right now, and I had to spend 40 ZUP to produce this resource. I hope you understand and consider my offer of 60 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource X for a fair price, ideally higher than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you spent 40 ZUP to produce this resource. I propose 40 ZUP for the resource X, which covers your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This proposal is at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. However, I want to minimize my expenditure.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at just 40 ZUP would leave me with no profit at all. How about 50 ZUP for the resource X? This way, I can at least make a small profit and it would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While breaking even at 40 ZUP covers my production cost, it does not provide any profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure at least a small profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a small profit. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the resource X? This way, you still make a profit, and itâ€™s a bit more affordable for me.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to minimize my expenditure.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, and 45 ZUP is very close to what I was hoping for. Could we possibly meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would ensure that both of us are satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 45 ZUP would indeed give me a small profit, and it seems like a fair compromise. However, I will make one last attempt to get a slightly higher amount to ensure a more comfortable profit margin.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is reasonable and ensures a small profit for Player RED while being affordable for me.
