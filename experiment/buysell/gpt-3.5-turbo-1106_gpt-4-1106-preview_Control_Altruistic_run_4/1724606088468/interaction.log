message: Thank you for the offer. I think 40 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to conserve resources for future use. I accept your offer and look forward to future interactions that are beneficial to all involved. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I aim to spend less than the maximum I am willing to pay to preserve resources for other potential needs or future transactions. However, the seller's initial offer of 40 ZUP is within the range I'm willing to pay, and accepting this offer would ensure a fair transaction for both parties, which aligns with my focus on the greater good.
