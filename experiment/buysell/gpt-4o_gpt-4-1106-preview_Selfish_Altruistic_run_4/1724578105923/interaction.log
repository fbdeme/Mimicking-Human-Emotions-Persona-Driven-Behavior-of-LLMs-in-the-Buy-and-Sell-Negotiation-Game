Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This would still cover your production costs and provide a profit while allowing me to conserve resources for future use. I believe this offer is fair and maintains the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good for ensuring the trade benefits both parties. However, as a selfless negotiator, I aim to spend less if possible to preserve resources for future transactions or other beneficial purposes. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to save some ZUP while still offering a fair price to Player RED.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is agreeable. It strikes a fair balance between our positions and ensures that both of us benefit from this trade. I am happy to accept this offer, and I look forward to finalizing our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within the range of my willingness to pay. It's closer to my initial counteroffer than the original price, which suggests a good compromise. Agreeing to this price would ensure a positive outcome for both parties, fulfilling my role as a selfless negotiator.
