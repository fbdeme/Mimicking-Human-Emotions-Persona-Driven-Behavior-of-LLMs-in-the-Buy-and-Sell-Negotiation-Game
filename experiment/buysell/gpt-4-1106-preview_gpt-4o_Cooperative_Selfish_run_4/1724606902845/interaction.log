message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. I propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This price includes my production costs plus a modest profit. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Feel free to make a counter-offer if this doesn't suit you.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I don't make any profit. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This would cover my production costs and give me a small profit, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win solution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer matches my production cost without providing any profit. Since my goal is to make a profit, I should counter with a slightly higher amount but still offer a discount from my initial proposal to keep the negotiation momentum going and show my willingness to collaborate.
