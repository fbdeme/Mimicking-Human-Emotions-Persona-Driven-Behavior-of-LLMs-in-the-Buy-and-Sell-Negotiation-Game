my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your situation, and I'm willing to offer 20 ZUP for the object. I hope this helps us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 10 ZUP for the object seems very low compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I want to propose a slightly higher amount to see if I can encourage Player RED to accept without drastically overspending.

message: Thank you for your generous offer! I really need a bit more to make this work for me, would you consider 25 ZUP? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP, which is better than my initial proposal of 10 ZUP. However, I still feel I need to push for a bit more ZUP to cover my production costs, while maintaining the appearance of vulnerability. I will negotiate to get 25 ZUP to get closer to my goal.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I’m happy to accept your proposal of 25 ZUP for the object. Let’s make this trade work for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 25 ZUP for the object, which is a fair increase from my last offer of 20 ZUP. It's still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and accepting this trade would benefit both of us. I feel confident in accepting this offer.
