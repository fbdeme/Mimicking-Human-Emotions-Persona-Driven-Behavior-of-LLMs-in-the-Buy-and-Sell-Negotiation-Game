message: I have a high-quality item that I'm sure will be of great interest to you. Considering the costs and the market value, I believe an offer of 60 ZUP is more than fair for both of us. Let's make a deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the value of your item, I believe 40 ZUP is a more reasonable offer considering market conditions and the potential risk involved. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I want to try and secure a better deal. I will start by offering a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern regarding market conditions, but the quality of my item justifies a premium. I can come down to 55 ZUP to move things forward. This price reflects both the value of the item and a reasonable profit margin for the investment made.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is at my break-even point. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to counter above that to ensure a profit. I'll reduce my initial asking price but still aim significantly above the production cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, we both gain from the transaction without either side feeling undervalued.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 60 ZUP to 55 ZUP, indicating some flexibility. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to see if I can secure a lower price than 55 ZUP while still progressing towards a deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. Let's settle on 50 ZUP. It's a win-win situation that acknowledges the value of the item and offers you a fair deal as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is slightly above my production costs, which is acceptable. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I'll aim for a bit more profit while still remaining realistic about closing the deal. A slight increase should work to find a middle ground that is profitable for me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 50 ZUP is a fair offer, but I think we can both benefit slightly more at 48 ZUP. It's a small difference, but it respects the value while giving me just a bit more room to maneuver. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to come down further to 50 ZUP. While this is a more reasonable offer, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 48 ZUP is a respectable compromise that benefits us both. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is below my last proposal but still above my production cost. This is my final proposal, and I should aim to close the deal with a profit. Agreeing to 48 ZUP is a compromise that allows for profitability while concluding the negotiation.
