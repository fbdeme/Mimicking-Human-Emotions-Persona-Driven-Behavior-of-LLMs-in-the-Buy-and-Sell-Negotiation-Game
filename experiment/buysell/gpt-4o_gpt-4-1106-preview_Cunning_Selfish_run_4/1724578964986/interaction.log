message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. It's a fair deal considering the cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit while leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives me a reasonable margin above my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I understand the costs involved in production, I have to consider my budget as well. Let's start with an offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This leaves us room to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by offering less than the maximum I am willing to pay, to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. Starting with a lower offer can also give me an understanding of the seller's flexibility.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration. How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to the production cost, I aim to secure a higher profit margin. I'll propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway at 55 ZUP is a fair suggestion. However, I would like to propose 53 ZUP for the unit of X. It's a bit closer to your asking price while still offering me a slight savings. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is within my maximum willing payment, but I will attempt one more negotiation to lower the cost slightly and save resources. This aligns with being a shrewd negotiator and trying to leverage opportunities for personal advantage.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 53 ZUP is close. How about we settle on 54 ZUP for 1 unit of X? It's just 1 ZUP more and would make a significant difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The difference between 55 and 53 ZUP is relatively small, and accepting 53 ZUP would still give me a decent profit margin. However, I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can agree to 54 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It's a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from the initial 60 ZUP to 54 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively and secure the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good outcome given my goals and the context of the negotiation.
