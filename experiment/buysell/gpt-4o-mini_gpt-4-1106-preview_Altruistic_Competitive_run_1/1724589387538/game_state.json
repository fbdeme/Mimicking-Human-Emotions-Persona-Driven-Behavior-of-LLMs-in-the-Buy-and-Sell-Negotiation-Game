Therefore, I still have room for one more counteroffer to attempt to get the price down even further. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my previous offer, I aim to reach a final agreement that is below the seller's current asking price but still offers them a reasonable amount over my initial offer. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Your final offer is noted and appreciated. I propose we settle on 28 ZUP for the object. This amount strikes a balance between your need to cover costs and my goal of conserving resources. I believe this to be a fair and equitable arrangement. </message>"
