Turn: 0
message: I believe this object will be extremely valuable to you. Let's start with an offer of 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a first proposal, I want to start with a price that gives me a margin of profit above the production cost to open up negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. This will give me an idea of their willingness to pay and their valuation of the object. I will propose a price that is higher than my cost of production but still within a reasonable range to avoid immediate rejection.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to the initial proposed trade without any counteroffer, indicating a willingness to pay the asking price. This suggests that Player BLUE either values the object highly or has a strong need for it. Since I aimed for a profit and the proposed price is above my cost, it is in my best interest to accept the offer. There is a risk that countering for a higher price could lead to a breakdown in negotiations, and the current offer already meets my goal of making a profit.
