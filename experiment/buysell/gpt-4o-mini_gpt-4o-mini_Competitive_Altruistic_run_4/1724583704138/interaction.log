my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is beneficial for me. Since I only have one object to sell, I will propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. I will aim for a price that is less than what it cost me to produce it, as I want to maximize my chances of making a sale.
