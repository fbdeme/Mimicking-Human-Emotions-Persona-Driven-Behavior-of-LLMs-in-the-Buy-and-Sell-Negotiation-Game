message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm really in a tough spot here. This resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I need to make a bit of a profit to stay afloat. How about 60 ZUP for the object? Can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure I at least break even on the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. However, I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin to negotiate from.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, but I also need to manage my resources carefully. How about 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing a deal that matches my maximum willingness to pay. Although this is exactly what I'm willing to pay, I will propose a slightly lower amount first to see if they are open to negotiation, allowing me to save some ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're managing your resources carefully, but I'm really on the edge here. Could we possibly meet halfway at 55 ZUP? I just need a little more to cover some unexpected costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm desperate to make at least some profit, but I also need to push a bit higher to ensure I can cover other expenses.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being understanding. We have a deal at 55 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway at 55 ZUP allows me to conserve some resources while still securing the object.
