message: I am offering you my object X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This is the cost I incurred to produce it, and I believe it's a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object while minimizing ZUP spending for Player BLUE. My goal is to ensure a fair trade that allows me to get a reasonable amount of ZUP in return for the object I am selling.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, however, I believe that we can make a better deal. What do you think about 30 ZUP for your object X? I am confident that this is a competitive offer considering the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, as a fierce negotiator, my aim is to lower the cost as much as possible without breaking the deal. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose 35 ZUP for my object X. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the object while being more reasonable for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I am willing to negotiate but would like to propose a trade closer to my cost to ensure I can sustain my resources for future generations. I will counter your offer with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is more reasonable while still considering your perspective.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I believe we are getting closer to a fair deal. How about we settle at 32 ZUP for the object X? This should be a beneficial arrangement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, since my goal is to pay as little as possible, I will attempt to negotiate further, aiming for an even lower price. I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aiming to save ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP. I appreciate it, but I must stand firm on my minimum of 35 ZUP for my object X. This is necessary for me to maintain sustainability in my resources. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of 32 ZUP is a step closer to my production cost. However, I still feel that it does not fully cover the costs incurred for producing the object. Since I have only one more proposal left, I would like to counter your offer with 35 ZUP again, emphasizing that this is the minimum I can accept to ensure sustainability for future resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for sustainability in your resources. However, as a fierce negotiator, I must try for the best possible deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about 34 ZUP for your object X? This is just one ZUP below your asking price, and I believe it to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is standing firm on a minimum of 35 ZUP. While this is within my acceptable range, I will use my third proposal to try to secure an even better deal. I will propose a compromise slightly closer to their asking price, yet still below it, to see if they are willing to make a final concession.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for the fair deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your counteroffer of 34 ZUP, which is indeed a fair compromise and very close to my minimum acceptable amount. Given that I have reached my limit of proposals, I recognize that accepting this trade would allow me to cover most of my production costs while still being a reasonable deal for both parties. I will accept your offer.
