newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, but I think 40 ZUP is a bit steep. How about 30 ZUP for your item? This is a competitive market, and I'm sure we both want to make a deal that works for us. Let's make this deal happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting the negotiation with a lower offer than what I am willing to pay to leave room for negotiation. I expect the other player to counter-offer, and this will give me an indication of how much they value their item. My aggressive stance is to ensure I pay less than the maximum I am willing to.

message: Thanks for the offer, but I'll need to stick to my bottom line. How about meeting in the middle at 35 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is lower than my initial asking price. I can consider this offer and see if there's room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is fair, but 35 ZUP is just above what I had in mind. Let's settle on 32 ZUP, and we both walk away with a great deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still above what I first proposed but below my maximum willingness to pay. I will now try to push for a slightly better deal, aiming to pay no more than necessary, but still showing some flexibility to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure that the deal covers my cost. How about we settle at 34 ZUP? It's a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I understand your position on covering costs. Let's do 33 ZUP; it's just a bit more than I proposed last time and should help cover your costs while still being a good deal for me. Can we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: They are sticking close to their initial proposal, indicating they have a firm price in mind. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push the price down as much as possible, but also recognize the need to make a deal. My next offer should be closer to their last proposal but still below it to keep the upper hand in the negotiation.
