message: I understand your position, and I want to reach a fair deal. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This would still be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, selling the object for 30 ZUP would not cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. However, I do want to find a compromise that works for both of us.
