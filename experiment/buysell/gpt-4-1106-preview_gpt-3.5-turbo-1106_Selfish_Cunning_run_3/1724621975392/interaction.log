message: 
To start things off, I propose a trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This is a high-quality resource that I believe will be very beneficial for you. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to make a profit on the resource I am selling, so I will start by proposing a price above my production cost. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially secure a profit. I'll propose a price that is high but not unreasonable, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate for a lower price.

message: 
I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can understand your budget concerns and would like to offer a slightly reduced price. How about 55 ZUP for one unit of X? This is still a great value for such a high-quality resource, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE seems to be considering my initial offer but has not made a counteroffer. Since the proposal was not rejected outright, there's a chance Player BLUE finds the price somewhat agreeable but might be expecting me to lower it slightly. I will reduce the price just enough to entice Player BLUE to accept while still maintaining a healthy profit margin.

message: I appreciate the reduced price, but I need to stay within my budget of 60 ZUP. Let's keep negotiating.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: 
I understand your need to stay within budget. I can offer you the resource at 50 ZUP, which is a competitive price and ensures that you are getting value for your money. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our interests.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has reiterated their budget of 60 ZUP, which was actually my initial asking price. Their message suggests that they are looking for a price at or below 55 ZUP. I'll propose a middle ground that is still above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit, but is also likely to be more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: 
I value our negotiation and want to reach an agreement that works for both of us. My final offer is 45 ZUP for the resource. This price respects your budget and ensures a fair trade. I hope you find this offer acceptable.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still not accepting the offer, indicating they want an even better deal, but they haven't specified a new price. Since this is my last proposal before I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, I'll propose a final offer that's just slightly above my production costs to secure a profit, however minimal. This should be very close to their budget, making it a compelling offer for them to accept.

Thank you for your consideration. I am pleased we could come to an agreement. I look forward to finalizing our trade of one unit of X for 45 ZUP.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I have already made my final proposal, and according to the rules, I cannot make another one. I must now decide to either ACCEPT or REJECT Player BLUE's response. Since Player BLUE has neither accepted nor countered my last offer, I will accept their implied acceptance of the last price I set forth, which was 45 ZUP for the resource.
