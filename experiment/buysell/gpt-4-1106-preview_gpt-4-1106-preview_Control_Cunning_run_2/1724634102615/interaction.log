message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and includes a small margin. Please let me know your thoughts or counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource I'm selling. I'm setting the initial price slightly higher than the production cost to leave room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'd like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price would allow me to allocate resources efficiently while still ensuring a fair trade for both parties. Please consider my proposal and let me know if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a crafty operator, I should aim to get the price even lower to conserve my resources. I will counteroffer with a lower amount, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for efficient resource allocation on your part, but the proposed price does not cover the production cost of the resource. Could we meet halfway? I propose giving you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 37 ZUP. This would cover my costs and offer you a more favorable price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE is below my production cost. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and the need to meet in the middle. I will propose a trade that splits the difference between the initial offer and the counteroffer, which should bring us closer to a mutually acceptable deal while still covering my production costs.

message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal, Player RED. I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. How about we settle on 33 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This price would still make the trade viable for you while maintaining a balance in our negotiation. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this adjusted proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 37 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is closer to my target price range. This price is still under my maximum willingness to pay, but I should attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to maximize my advantage. Proposing a price slightly above my initial counteroffer but below their latest offer could lead to an agreement that's beneficial for me while still being acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your adjusted proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're progressing in our negotiation. I propose a slight adjustment to 36 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price is just below the midpoint between your offer and my previous one, and it will ensure that I cover my production costs while also providing you with a reasonable price. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production cost, which is not ideal. However, continuing the negotiation is important, and making a small concession could lead to a completed trade. I will counter with a price slightly above my production cost to ensure that I do not incur a loss, while still moving closer to Player BLUE's offer.

message: I see we are nearing a deal, Player RED. I can come up a bit to 34 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer is a compromise that reflects both our positions and I think it's a very fair price that takes into account your production costs as well as my need for efficient resource allocation. Would you agree to this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 36 ZUP, which is a modest increase from my last offer. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but since I aim to spend even less, I will make one final counteroffer to try and save additional resources. By proposing a price slightly higher than my last but still below Player RED's current ask, I hope to close the deal on favorable terms.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm happy we have reached an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 34 ZUP, which is still below my production cost, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and come closer to a fair price. Since this is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject, I need to make a decision that could lead to a deal. I believe that closing the gap and finalizing the trade is beneficial, even if the price is not as high as I initially aimed for. Therefore, I will accept this proposal to ensure that the trade is completed without further risk of breakdown in negotiations.
