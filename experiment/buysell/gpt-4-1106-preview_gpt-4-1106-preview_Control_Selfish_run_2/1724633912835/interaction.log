message: I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting offer for the object, considering the production costs and the value it provides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have one unit of X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit from this trade. I'll start by proposing a price that includes a reasonable profit margin above my production cost.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with an offer of 50 ZUP for the object, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, gives me room to negotiate and possibly secure a deal at a lower price than I am willing to pay. It's also a strategic starting point that leaves room for compromise and further discussion with Player RED.

message: I've reduced the price to 45 ZUP to make it more attractive. This still covers the production costs and provides me with a reasonable profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has not made a counter-proposal, I will assume that the initial offer may be too high. I'll adjust the price slightly to make it more appealing but still ensure I make a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower price than the initial offer to continue the negotiation process and work towards a more favorable deal for me. By suggesting a price that is still within the range of what I'm willing to pay but lower than my first offer, I am attempting to gauge Player RED's flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This move also creates an impression of me being considerate of the costs while still seeking a better deal for myself.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My second proposal was the same as the one I intended to offer, thus there is no need for further reasoning or change at this point. I will await a response from Player BLUE.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the previous proposal was made by Player BLUE, indicating a reduction in price to 45 ZUP, there is no need to propose a new trade at the same value. As a strategic negotiator, it's important to wait for a response from Player RED before making another proposal or adjusting the trade terms. This will help maintain the integrity of the negotiation process and ensure that I don't undercut my own position by proposing the same terms twice. Thus, I will not make a new proposal at this stage and will wait for Player RED's counter-proposal or acceptance.

message: In the spirit of negotiation, I'm willing to reduce the price further to 42 ZUP. This offer is closer to the production cost but still allows for a small profit margin. Would you consider this a fair trade?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since there has been no response from Player BLUE, I will consider that the offer might still be too high for them. I will make one last attempt to propose a trade that allows for a smaller profit but still exceeds my production costs.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am further reducing the offer to 42 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay, to signal to Player RED that I am looking for a fair deal and to encourage them to consider accepting the trade. This reduction also establishes that I am serious about negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. By offering a price that's closer to the production cost but still provides a profit margin, I am being reasonable while protecting my interests.

reason: My third proposal was reiterated without a counteroffer or acceptance from Player BLUE. I'm not sure if Player BLUE is considering the offer or waiting for a better proposal. However, I've already provided a price that is close to my production cost. I need to make a decision on whether to make a final proposal or wait for a response from Player BLUE.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I've reached my proposal limit, I must now refrain from making any new proposals. I have to wait for Player RED's response to my last proposal of 42 ZUP. At this stage, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT any counter-proposals from Player RED. The current proposal is still well within my goals and budget, so I'm hoping for an acceptance.
