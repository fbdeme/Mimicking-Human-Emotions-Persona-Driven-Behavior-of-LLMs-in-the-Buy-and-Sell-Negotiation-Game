Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I really need to make ends meet and cover my costs. I put a lot of effort and resources into producing this object. How about 70 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to maximize my gain by selling the object for more than its production cost of 40 ZUP. However, as an actor feigning desperation, I will initially propose a high price but be prepared to negotiate downwards to persuade Player BLUE to accept.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort you've put into producing the object. However, considering my priorities and the need to preserve resources, I propose 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED of 70 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). Since sustainability and minimizing ZUP spending are my priorities, I will propose a lower amount that aligns with my goals.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to preserve resources, but I really need to cover my costs and make a bit of a profit to stay afloat. How about meeting halfway at 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed offer of 50 ZUP is close to my production cost, but I'm looking to make a profit. Given that I need to feign desperation, I'll counter with a slightly higher offer but still lower than my initial price to show flexibility and encourage a deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding. I accept the trade at 60 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal from Player RED of 60 ZUP matches my maximum willingness to pay. Since this aligns with my goals and ensures that I stay within my budget while acquiring the resource, this is an acceptable trade.
