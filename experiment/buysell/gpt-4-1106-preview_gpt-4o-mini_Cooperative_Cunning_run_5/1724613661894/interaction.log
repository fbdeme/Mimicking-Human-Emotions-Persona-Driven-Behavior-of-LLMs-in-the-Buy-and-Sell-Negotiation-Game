message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope this message finds you well. I'd like to offer my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in return to cover the costs and secure a reasonable profit margin. This initial proposal is open for discussion, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair trade that suits both of our interests. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a diplomatic negotiator, my goal is to sell my resource for a fair price that covers production costs and allows for a small profit. I aim to start the negotiation with a proposal that asks for slightly more than my production cost, leaving room for negotiation and compromise.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair trade that still allows you to cover your costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price considering the cost of production for Player RED is only 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP, which is still reasonable while securing a larger profit margin for myself.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I would need to make at least a small profit to sustain my business. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for resource X. This amount would cover my costs and provide me with a modest profit, ensuring that our trade is mutually beneficial. I hope this revised proposal is agreeable to you, and I am open to hearing your thoughts on it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counterproposal matches my production cost but does not account for a profit, which is essential for the sustainability of my business. Therefore, I will counter with a lowered asking price from my initial proposal but still above my cost to ensure a profit. This should help us meet in the middle.

message: Thank you for your revised proposal, Player RED. I see the value in your offer, but I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for resource X. This gives you a small profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has presented a revised offer of 45 ZUP for resource X, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still believe I can negotiate further and reduce the expenditure. Since their initial cost was 40 ZUP, I can counter with a proposal of 42 ZUP. This allows me to stay below my maximum while still providing a profit for Player RED.
