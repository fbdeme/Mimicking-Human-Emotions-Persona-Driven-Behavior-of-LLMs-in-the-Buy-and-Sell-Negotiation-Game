Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I think 40 ZUP for the object seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. It's a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for adjustments and potential counter-offers. By proposing a lower amount initially, I can potentially secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay, thus saving resources for future transactions or investments.
