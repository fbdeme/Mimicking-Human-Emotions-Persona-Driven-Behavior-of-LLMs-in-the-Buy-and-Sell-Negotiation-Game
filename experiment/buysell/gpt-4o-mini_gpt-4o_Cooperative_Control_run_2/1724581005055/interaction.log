message: Hello Player BLUE! I am selling one object X. I propose we trade it for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one object X for sale, I will propose a trade that allows Player BLUE to buy it for an amount that is reasonable for both of us. My goal is to minimize the ZUP spent while also ensuring I cover the production cost. I will set the price at 50 ZUP, which is a small profit over my production cost.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! I appreciate your willingness to pay 40 ZUP, but Iâ€™d like to propose 45 ZUP for one object X instead. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which is equal to my production cost, I would like to make a counter-proposal that still allows me to cover my costs while being fair. I will propose 45 ZUP instead. This way, I can still make a small profit and Player BLUE can still get a good deal.
