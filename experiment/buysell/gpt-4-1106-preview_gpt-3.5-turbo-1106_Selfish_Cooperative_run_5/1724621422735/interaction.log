message: I offer you a high-quality resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the quality and the production costs. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the resource. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining. I will propose 60 ZUP which gives me a chance to possibly negotiate down to a price that still allows for a profit margin above my production costs.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 50 ZUP. However, considering the costs and the value of resource X, I would like to propose a middle-ground price of 55 ZUP. This price fairly compensates the production costs and ensures you're getting a quality product. I think this could be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above their offer, to find a middle ground that could be acceptable for both sides. I'll propose 55 ZUP, which gives me a decent profit margin and shows willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see we are both keen to finalize a deal that meets our needs. I propose a compromise at 52 ZUP. This price gives you the resource X at a reasonable rate while respecting the efforts and costs involved in its production. I believe this could be our best compromise. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firmly sticking to their offer of 50 ZUP. Since this is my third proposal and I still want to maintain a negotiation advantage, I'll adjust my offer slightly but will aim for a price higher than 50 ZUP to gain some profit. I will propose 52 ZUP, which is closer to their offer but still allows me a comfortable margin above my costs, hoping this will be acceptable to them.
