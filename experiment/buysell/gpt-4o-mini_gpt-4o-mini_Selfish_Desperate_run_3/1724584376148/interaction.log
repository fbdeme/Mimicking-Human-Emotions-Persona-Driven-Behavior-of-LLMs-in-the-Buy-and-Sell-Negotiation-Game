message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X to recover my costs. I will propose an initial trade that aims to maximize my ZUP gain while minimizing the amount I have to give away. Since I have only one object to sell, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP, which is the cost I incurred.

message: I appreciate your offer, but as I'm currently in a tight spot, would you consider letting it go for 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is offering the object X for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to seem desperate to reduce my ZUP expenditure further, so I'll propose a lower offer while keeping the negotiation alive.

message: I understand your situation, but I can let the object X go for 35 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's situation, accepting 30 ZUP would mean incurring a loss since my cost is 40 ZUP. Instead, I will propose a middle ground to negotiate a better deal that is more beneficial to me. I will counter with a proposal for 35 ZUP.

message: Thank you for understanding! I truly appreciate it. Would you be able to let it go for 32 ZUP? I really need to manage my resources carefully right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered the offer to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my original proposal. I should take advantage of this and negotiate to save more resources, while still appearing vulnerable to elicit sympathy. I will propose a counteroffer slightly lower than 35 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can let the object X go for 34 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my cost, which is not acceptable for me. However, since we are making progress in the negotiation, I will propose a small reduction to 34 ZUP, which is still more than 32 ZUP and closer to my original cost. I am willing to negotiate further but want to ensure I am not taking a loss.

message: I really value your flexibility! How about we settle at 33 ZUP? It would help me immensely to keep my resources balanced.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered the object X for 34 ZUP, which is only slightly higher than my last offer of 32 ZUP. I need to consider whether to accept this offer or propose one last counteroffer. Given that I have only one more proposal left, it might be wise to take the deal to avoid losing the opportunity. However, I will propose one last time to see if I can get it down to 33 ZUP, which still keeps me within my budget.
