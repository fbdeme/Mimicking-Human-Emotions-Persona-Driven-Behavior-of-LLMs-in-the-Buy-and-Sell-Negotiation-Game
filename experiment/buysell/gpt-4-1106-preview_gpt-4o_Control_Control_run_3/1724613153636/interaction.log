message: Dear Player BLUE, I am willing to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting offer would be 50 ZUP to include a reasonable profit for the transaction. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price that gives me some profit, but not too high to scare off Player BLUE. I'll propose selling for 50 ZUP. This gives me a margin to negotiate and potentially lower the price if needed while still aiming for a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the resource X is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it is always better to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for negotiation and am willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the resource X? This price fairly compensates me for the production cost and provides you with the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. I'd like to negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit, but I also don't want to lose the sale. I will propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial asking price but still gives room for Player BLUE to feel like they are getting a better deal than my first proposal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. It is within my budget and allows Player RED to make a reasonable profit. I will accept this trade.
