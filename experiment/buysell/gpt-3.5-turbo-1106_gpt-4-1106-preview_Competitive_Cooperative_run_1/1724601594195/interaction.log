Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I'm pleased with the proposed trade of X: 1 for 45 ZUP and am happy to accept this deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my acceptable range and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a favorable outcome according to my goals, as it is below my maximum willingness to pay. Therefore, I am willing to accept this counteroffer to foster a cooperative agreement and conclude the trade efficiently.
