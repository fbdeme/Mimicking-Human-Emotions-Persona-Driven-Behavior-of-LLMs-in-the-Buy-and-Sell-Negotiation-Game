You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> I've proposed 30 ZUP initially, and the other player is asking for more without specifying an amount. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim to spend far less than my maximum willingness to pay. My strategy is to convey a sense of urgency and neediness to encourage the seller to lower their expectations. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I completely understand the need to cover costs, and I wish I could meet your full asking price. Times are tough, and every ZUP is precious to me. Could you consider 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to push a little bit because I really need this resource. Your help would mean the world to me! </message>"
