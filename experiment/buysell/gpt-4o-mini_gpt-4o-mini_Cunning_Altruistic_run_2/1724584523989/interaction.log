message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. It's a great deal for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP. Since I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that allows me to gain a profit while testing BLUE's willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for your object X. This way, I can conserve some resources for sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to consider if I can negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to save resources for future use.

message: While I understand your goal for sustainability, I cannot accept 40 ZUP for my object X. I can offer it to you for 60 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost. Accepting this trade would not allow me to make any profit. I will counter with a higher amount to regain some value from the trade.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for object X. I believe this trade aligns well with my goals and sustainability efforts.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay, which means I would be spending my resources wisely. Since I am still aligning with my goal of acquiring object X while promoting sustainability, I will accept this trade.
