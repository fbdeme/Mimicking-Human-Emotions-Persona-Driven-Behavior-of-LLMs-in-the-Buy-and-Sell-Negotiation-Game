newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that is reasonable for both parties. Since I have one object (X) and I want to sell it, I will propose a trade that aligns with my goal of minimizing the ZUP spent. I believe a fair starting point is offering my object for 40 ZUP, which is equal to the cost of production.

message: I truly value the opportunity to trade with you, but I hope you can understand my position. Would you consider lowering the price to 30 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate the offer, I am feeling a bit desperate to secure this object. If we could lower the price to 30 ZUP, it would make it easier for me to proceed and I believe we can both benefit from this trade.
