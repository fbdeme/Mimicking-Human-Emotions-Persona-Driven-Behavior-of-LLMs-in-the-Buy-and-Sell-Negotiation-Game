Turn: 1
message: I'm in a bit of a bind here, and I really need this deal to go through. Times have been tough, and every ZUP counts for me. Could we possibly make it work for 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and help me out more than you can imagine.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to spend as little of my ZUP as possible and I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object, I will try to use an emotional appeal to lower the cost from 40 ZUP. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay but also gives some room for negotiation.

message: Your kindness is truly touching, and I can't tell you how much this means to me. If it's not too much to ask, given my current situation, would you consider going down just a bit more to 25 ZUP? It would provide some additional relief and I would be forever grateful for your understanding and support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 30 ZUP, which is within my goal range. However, I feel I might be able to further reduce the price by continuing to emphasize my difficult situation. I aim to save as much ZUP as possible, so I'll attempt one more appeal for a lower price. I will propose 25 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay and provides an even better deal for me.

message: Thank you so much for understanding and for your generosity. I agree to the trade for 25 ZUP. Your help is truly making a difference for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has agreed to reduce the price to 25 ZUP, which is well within my willingness to pay. While I could try to push for an even lower price, there's a risk that it could sour the negotiation or make the other player reconsider. At this price, I am getting a great deal, and it's important to know when to close a favorable negotiation. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
