message: I am offering my object for sale. Would you be willing to pay 40 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object for at least 40 ZUP to cover my costs. I will propose a trade that reflects this value while also potentially being attractive to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the object, but I would like to propose a purchase price of 35 ZUP. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP), it is a good starting point for negotiation. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I will try to get a better deal by proposing a lower amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal of 35 ZUP. However, I need to cover my costs, so I would like to stick to my original price of 40 ZUP. Would you be willing to meet this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's interest in the object, but 35 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I need to counter their proposal to ensure I cover my costs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs, and I appreciate your firm stance on the price. However, I would like to propose a new price of 37 ZUP hoping to meet halfway between my initial offer and your asking price. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm on their asking price, but it is still within my willingness to pay. I might be able to find a middle ground that is more favorable than the initial 40 ZUP offer. I will attempt to counter with a slightly higher offer than my first to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for savings.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 37 ZUP, but I still need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will stick to my asking price of 40 ZUP. Can you meet this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their adjustment to 37 ZUP, but I still cannot accept this offer as it does not meet my production cost. I will need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your production costs, and I want to ensure this is a fair transaction for both of us. I propose a price of 38 ZUP, which is closer to your asking price while still providing me with a slight discount. Let's finalize this deal at 38 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their production cost and is not budging from the 40 ZUP asking price. The price is still within my acceptable range, and it may be prudent to close the deal soon to avoid the risk of not securing the object, while still saving compared to my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one last attempt to negotiate for a slightly better price, leaving room for one more proposal if necessary.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see your offer of 38 ZUP is a fair compromise, and while it is below my production cost, I will accept it to conclude the transaction. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP, it still does not meet my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, since this is my fourth proposal and I cannot propose again, I must weigh the possibility of accepting this trade to make any profit.
