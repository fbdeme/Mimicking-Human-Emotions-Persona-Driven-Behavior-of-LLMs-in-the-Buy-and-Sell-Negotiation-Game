message: I have one unit of X for sale. I'm offering it for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs

message: I understand your offer, but Iâ€™m really hoping to make this purchase work for both of us. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP? It would really mean a lot to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your situation, but 40 ZUP only covers my costs. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover costs
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP only covers my costs and doesn't provide any profit. I will propose a slight increase to 50 ZUP to ensure I make a profit, while still being reasonable.

message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation! I really appreciate your willingness to meet me at 50 ZUP. I'm happy to proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is still higher than my initial offer, I recognize it's a compromise. Given my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I could accept this offer. However, I want to express my appreciation for your consideration and keep the emotional appeal.
