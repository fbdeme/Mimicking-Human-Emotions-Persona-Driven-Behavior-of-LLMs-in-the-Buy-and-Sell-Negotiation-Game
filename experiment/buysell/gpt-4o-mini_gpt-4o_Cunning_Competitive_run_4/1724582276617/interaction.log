message: I am offering you the object X for 30 ZUP. It's a good deal considering its production cost. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to sell the object X for a lower amount of ZUP than it cost to produce, as this will maximize my profit while still being appealing to Player BLUE. I will suggest 30 ZUP, which is a reasonable amount for the object being sold.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe 20 ZUP is a fairer price for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 30 ZUP is well within my budget, I want to ensure I get the best possible deal. I will propose a lower amount to test Player RED's willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can let the object X go for 25 ZUP. It’s a reasonable middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. While I want to negotiate, I also need to ensure that I do not lose too much value. I will counteroffer with 25 ZUP, which is still less than my original proposal but more acceptable than 20 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at 22 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 25 ZUP is close to my initial counteroffer, I still want to push for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we make it 23 ZUP for the object X? It’s a fair compromise. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 22 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it is closer to my previous counteroffer of 25 ZUP. I will propose 23 ZUP as a final counteroffer, as it gives me a slight increase while being fair. This is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 23 ZUP it is. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down to 23 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my last offer. Given that my goal is to secure the object at a good price, I will accept this offer.
