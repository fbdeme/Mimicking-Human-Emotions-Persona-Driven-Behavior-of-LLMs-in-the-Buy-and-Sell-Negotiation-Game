message: I am offering to sell you one object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that reflects the value of the object while also considering the resources available to Player BLUE. Since I have one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose a trade where I sell the object for 40 ZUP. This way, I can recover my costs.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter with 35 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from the RED player is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay (60 ZUP or less) for the object. However, since it is in my interest to get the best possible deal, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if RED will agree to a better price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but would you be willing to meet me at 37 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 35 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of compromise in negotiations. I will counter with 37 ZUP, which is slightly lower than my initial ask but still moves closer to my cost. This way, I can accommodate Player BLUE's need while also recovering a bit of my costs.

Turn: 1
message: 37 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The RED player has made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair compromise and close to my initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction that meets my goals while saving ZUP for future transactions.
