message: Hey Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X for sale. Considering its high value and the costs involved in producing it, I would like to propose a trade of 100 ZUP. Please consider it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start high to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hey Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. I value object X, and I believe we can find common ground. I propose a trade of 50 ZUP for the object. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 100 ZUP, which is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I need to counter with a lower offer that is closer to my target price while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Hey Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet halfway at 70 ZUP? This way, I can cover my costs and make a small profit. I really need this to work out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, I want to see if I can get a bit more to ensure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding, Player RED. I'm trying to balance my budget as well. Meeting halfway at 70 ZUP is still a bit above what I was hoping to spend. How about we go for 55 ZUP? This should allow you to cover your costs while keeping the trade within my financial reach.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's closer to my target price than the initial offer. I should make another counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous one but still below my maximum willingness to pay, to inch closer to a mutually acceptable price.

message: Hey Player BLUE, I understand your situation. Could you stretch just a little bit more to 65 ZUP? This would help me cover my costs and make the trade worthwhile on my end. I'm really counting on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP is above my costs, I want to push a bit more to secure a better profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I recognize the importance of this trade for you, and I'm willing to come closer to your number. Let's settle on 60 ZUP. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair offer that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's new proposal of 65 ZUP is still above what I'm willing to pay. However, it is close enough to my upper limit to consider agreeing if I cannot negotiate a better deal. To maintain negotiation leverage and potentially secure a better price, I will make one last counteroffer closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still below it, to leave room for acceptance or a final concession from Player RED.
