message: Please, I really need to sell this object! I can only accept a lower amount of ZUP. I hope you can help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for ZUP, but I cannot afford to part with it for too high a price. I will propose a lower amount of ZUP to demonstrate my neediness and hopefully encourage concessions from Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're in need of selling the object, and I'm willing to help. However, I need to ensure that the trade is fair for both of us. How about a starting proposal of 25 ZUP for the object? Let's find a middle ground that works for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED suggests that they are willing to accept a lower amount of ZUP for the object, I will start with a low offer to see how they respond. This will give me room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary, while still aiming to pay less than the maximum amount I am willing to spend.

message: Thank you for your understanding! I can only stretch my resources to 15 ZUP. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 25 ZUP, it still exceeds my current willingness to pay. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my affordability while still showing that I want to make a deal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our two offers. Would you be willing to accept 30 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 15 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount to move towards a compromise while still ensuring a favorable trade for myself. Considering Player RED's urgency to sell, they might be willing to accept a reasonable increase from their last proposal.

message: I really appreciate your flexibility! I can only go up to 20 ZUP for this object. I hope you can understand my situation and we can finalize this deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge the offer of 30 ZUP as a fair compromise, but it is still higher than I can manage. I will propose a final offer which is still below 30 ZUP, as I truly need to sell the object. This is my last chance to propose before I must accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I am glad we are making progress. I propose 35 ZUP for the object. This is a significant increase from your last offer and should help us close the deal efficiently, while taking into account the urgency of your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 20 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. To move closer to a deal while maintaining a strong position, I will increase my offer slightly more, aiming to settle at a price that is still advantageous for me.

message: Thank you so much for your understanding and flexibility! I will accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. I'm grateful we could come to an agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the increase to 35 ZUP, it is still beyond my means. I have reached my limit for proposals, and I must now decide whether to accept or reject the last offer. Since I need to sell the object, I will reluctantly accept the offer.
