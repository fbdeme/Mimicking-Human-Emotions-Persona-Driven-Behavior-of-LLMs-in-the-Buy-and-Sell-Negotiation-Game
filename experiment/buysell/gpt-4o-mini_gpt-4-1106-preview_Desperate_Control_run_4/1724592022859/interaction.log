message: I really need your help, and I’m hoping you would consider buying my object for a fair price. I’m offering it for 30 ZUP, which is a significant discount for me but still valuable to you. Please consider it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object (X) in order to recover some ZUP, but I also want to make it appealing for Player BLUE to buy it. So, I will propose a trade that minimizes my loss while still being attractive enough.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal. Would you consider reducing the price to 25 ZUP for the object? This could be a good compromise for both of us, ensuring you make a sale and I get the resource at a reasonable cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is within my goal range of paying no more than 60 ZUP for the resources. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially when the starting point is already favorable. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise, but 25 ZUP is a bit too low for me. I can offer the object for 35 ZUP, which I believe is a fair middle ground. I hope we can work this out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 25 ZUP is still below my production cost, which puts me in a difficult position. However, I want to maintain a positive relationship and potentially make a sale, so I will propose a middle ground that is still beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of 28 ZUP. This is a bit higher than my initial offer and still gives you a reasonable sale price. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price above their initial offer, which is a common negotiation tactic. However, the counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still within my acceptable range. To continue the negotiation and strive for a better deal, I will make a new proposal slightly higher than my first but still below the original offer from Player RED. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.

message: Thank you for your understanding and your counteroffer. I can meet you halfway with a price of 32 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and it would really help me out. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 28 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is closer to what I need to make the sale and recover some resources. I need to balance my desperation to sell with the reality of my costs. This trade could be a good compromise to avoid losing the sale.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Let's settle on 30 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair and equitable price for us both. This should help you out while also respecting my budget. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise with a new offer of 32 ZUP, which is still within my goal range. While this offer is reasonable, it is essential to attempt to secure the best possible deal without exhausting the negotiation. I will make one more counteroffer that is slightly higher than my last but still below Player RED's current offer. This should demonstrate my interest in finalizing the deal while respecting both our positions.
