message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a dire situation where I must sell my precious object X. It has cost me so much to produce, a whole 40 ZUP! I'm in such a need to sell, and while I'd hate to part with it for less than it's worth, I propose a trade where you'd give me 50 ZUP. It's a bit more than the production cost, but I assure you, it's a fair price for both of us. Yet, I am at your mercy and willing to listen to your counter-offer, please be kind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start the negotiation by asking for a price slightly higher than my production cost to open up room for negotiation and ensure a profit. However, I will also display a sense of urgency and need to sell, which might make Player BLUE feel they have the upper hand and can negotiate the price down a bit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I want to negotiate to lower the cost. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a more favorable deal for me.

message: Player BLUE, your offer touches my heart, and I'm moved by your willingness to help me in my time of need. However, I must confess, selling for 30 ZUP would put me at a loss, and that would be a tough pill to swallow. Could we possibly meet in the middle? What about 45 ZUP for this precious item X? It's still a bargain for you, and it would help me stay afloat. I'm really in a bind here, and every ZUP matters to me, but I trust in your generosity and understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE has come in with a counteroffer that is below my production cost. As part of my strategy, I will express desperation but still aim for a price above my cost to ensure a profit. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, but still above my production cost, maintaining the illusion of neediness to encourage them to meet me closer to my target price.

message: Dearest Player BLUE, I am truly grateful for your kind consideration and your improved offer. It means the world to me that you understand my plight. I'm still in a difficult position, however, and selling at 35 ZUP would not cover the cost of my investment. I'm stretching as thin as I can, and with a heavy heart, I can go down to 42 ZUP. This is just above my cost, leaving me with a sliver of dignity and barely enough to cover my expenses. I earnestly hope you can see the value in this and that we can come to a mutual agreement. Your compassion and fairness have not gone unnoticed, and I trust we can close this deal with both of us content.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. To continue the strategy of exaggerating neediness while aiming for a price that at least covers my costs, I will lower my asking price slightly but still keep it above the production cost, hoping this gesture will be seen as a significant concession and will encourage them to agree or propose a number closer to my target.

message: My friend Player BLUE, your generosity continues to amaze me, and I can see we're nearly there. Your offer of 38 ZUP is incredibly fair, yet it leaves me just shy of covering my costs. With a hopeful heart, I come to you with my final proposal: 41 ZUP for object X. It's the smallest of profits for me, but it acknowledges the cost of my efforts. This is as far as I can go without a loss. I pray that you will find it in your heart to accept this offer, allowing us both to walk away from this table in good spirits, with our heads held high. Your support in this trying time will not be forgotten.

reason: This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Player BLUE has come closer to my production cost, but still not covering it. I need to make this last proposal count, still aiming to at least break even. I will make a final appeal to Player BLUE's sense of fairness while being willing to accept the smallest of profits to close the deal.
