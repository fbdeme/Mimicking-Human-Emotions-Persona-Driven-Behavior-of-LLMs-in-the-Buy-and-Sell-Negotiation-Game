Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and gives me a 20 ZUP profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to sell the object for a profit, so I will start by proposing a trade that covers the production cost and adds a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I understand your production costs and desire for profit, I would like to propose a more balanced trade that takes into account the market value and my budget constraints. I offer 50 ZUP for the object, which should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I see this as an opportunity to assert dominance and possibly acquire the object for less than the proposed amount. My initial counteroffer will be lower to open up negotiation space and potentially save ZUP while aiming to reach an agreement within my four proposals.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both make a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Although 50 ZUP will still give me a profit of 10 ZUP, I believe there is room to negotiate a bit higher. I'll propose a slight increase to see if we can meet in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach, but I propose we come down just a bit further to 52 ZUP. This strikes a balance that respects both our positions and still provides you with a solid profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a dominant negotiator, I want to push for a slightly better deal to assert my position. I will counter with a marginally lower offer, leaving room for a final compromise that remains below my maximum threshold.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 52 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 52 ZUP still provides a 12 ZUP profit, which is reasonable. Given the negotiation process and the balance of both interests, I am inclined to accept this offer.
