message: I'm interested in the object, but I'm currently looking at multiple offers. Would you consider 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 40 ZUP for one object, which is within the budget I am willing to spend. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I see an opportunity to propose a lower price to save some of my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.
