Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource X that I'm offering. Considering the costs of production and the market value, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to start by setting a high price to anchor the negotiation in my favor, and then I can adjust based on the counteroffers. I will propose a trade that gives me a profit margin above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'd like to counter with a proposal of my own. How about I offer 40 ZUP for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the initial offer of 60 ZUP is too high. I'll propose a counteroffer to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must consider the value of the resource X and the investment made into its production. Let's meet in the middle at 50 ZUP. This still provides you with a reasonable price and allows me to cover costs and gain a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which doesn't provide any profit. As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert dominance by not immediately dropping to break-even and instead meet halfway between my initial proposal and the counteroffer to maintain a strong position and secure a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I still feel that 50 ZUP is a bit high. I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my target price, but I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'll propose another counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are close to reaching an agreement. I propose 48 ZUP for the resource X, which is a compromise that reflects the quality and value of the resource while still being a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP provides a slight profit over my production costs. However, as an assertive negotiator, I should aim to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gains while still showing some flexibility. I will counter just above the offered amount to see if there is room for an increased proposal, while still staying close enough to the counteroffer to encourage agreement.
proposal count: 3
