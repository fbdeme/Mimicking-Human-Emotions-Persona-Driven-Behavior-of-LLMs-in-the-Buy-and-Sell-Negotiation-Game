message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I'm in a terrible predicament! I've invested every last ZUP I had into crafting this exquisite object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm in such a desperate situation that I need to ask for a bit more just to keep my head above water. Can you find it in your heart to offer me 60 ZUP for it? I assure you it's worth every ZUP for its quality and craftsmanship.

reason: I'm looking to sell my object X at a profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. However, as a calculated performer, I will exaggerate neediness to try and convince Player BLUE to pay more than the production cost, aiming for a starting proposal that's high enough to allow room for negotiation but not so high that it will scare off Player BLUE.

message: I deeply appreciate your understanding and your offer of 45 ZUP, truly. Your respect for sustainability is admirable. But I must confess, the situation for me is quite dire. I'm struggling to just break even. Could we possibly meet in the middle? I'm willing to reduce my ask significantly. What about 55 ZUP? It would be a tremendous help, and you'd still be getting a fair deal for the exceptional value of object X.

message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is so generous, and I'm nearly moved to tears by your understanding and willingness to help. I'm reaching out with open arms, hoping we can settle on just a smidge moreâ€”52 ZUP. This tiny bit extra would make a world of difference for me. Can we finalize this deal at 52 ZUP? I promise you won't regret investing in this marvelous object X.

I will make a small concession to show good faith while still aiming for a higher return.
