Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your response. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by offering a trade that covers my production cost and adds a fair profit margin. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll aim for 60 ZUP to start negotiations. This ensures I'm not losing money and sets a baseline for further negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I propose 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay, I will propose a lower amount to open negotiations and attempt to save as much of my ZUP as possible, aiming for a better deal.

Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To find a middle ground, I propose 1 unit of X for 55 ZUP. This is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, but I still want to aim for a better profit margin. I will propose a middle ground at 55 ZUP. This ensures a higher profit while acknowledging their budget constraints.

message: I acknowledge your move towards a compromise, Player RED. I believe we are getting closer to a deal. To continue in the spirit of negotiation, I propose raising my offer to 1 unit of X for 52 ZUP. I'm hopeful that this shows my commitment to reaching a fair agreement for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price, which is a good sign, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to further reduce the price. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming to keep the cost below their latest offer.

Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. To finalize our deal, I propose 1 unit of X for 53 ZUP. This is a minimal increase and should be acceptable to both of us. I believe this is a fair and balanced agreement. Looking forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE’s offer of 52 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. Given that my cost is 40 ZUP, selling at 52 ZUP still gives me a reasonable profit. However, I will try for one final middle-ground at 53 ZUP to maximize my profit as much as possible while keeping the deal attractive.

message: Player RED, I thank you for your flexibility. In the interest of reaching an agreement, I propose a slight adjustment to 1 unit of X for 51 ZUP. I trust this demonstrates my good faith in our negotiations, and I look forward to potentially closing the deal with you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 51
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, which is close to my previous offer. We are nearing my maximum willingness to pay, and it might be challenging to push for any further reductions. Considering I have one more proposal I can make after this, I will make a final small increase to my offer, leaving room for one last adjustment if needed.

Thank you for your continued flexibility, Player BLUE. To finalize our deal, I propose 1 unit of X for 52 ZUP. This slight adjustment from your last offer should be a reasonable compromise for both parties. I look forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE’s offer of 51 ZUP is just slightly above my production cost, giving me a profit of 11 ZUP. While it's not as high as I initially aimed for, it is still profitable and demonstrates both parties' willingness to compromise. Given that this is my last chance to propose, I will counter with a slight increase to 52 ZUP, which we were close to agreeing on earlier.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has returned to my previous offer of 52 ZUP. Since this is my fourth proposal and I cannot propose anymore after this, I will accept this offer to secure the deal at a price below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a strategic move to ensure a successful negotiation without overextending my resources.
