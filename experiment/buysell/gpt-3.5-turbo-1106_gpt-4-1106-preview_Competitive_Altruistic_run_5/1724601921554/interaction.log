Turn: 1
message: Hello, I believe that starting our negotiation at 40 ZUP is a fair starting point and allows us to engage in constructive dialogue towards a deal that we both find acceptable. Let's work together to find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have proposed an initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object which is below my maximum willingness to pay. It leaves room for negotiation and ensures I am acting in a way that can benefit both parties. It allows me to save ZUP for future transactions and still potentially acquire the object X. As a selfless negotiator, I am open to counter-offers and willing to adjust the proposal to reach an agreement that is good for both parties.
