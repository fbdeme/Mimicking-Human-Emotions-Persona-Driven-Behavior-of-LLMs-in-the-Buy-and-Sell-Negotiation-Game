message: Hello Player BLUE, I value our potential partnership and am looking to trade my resource X, which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. I propose an initial trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP, providing me with a modest profit and you with the resource you need. I believe this offer is fair, but I'm open to your perspective and willing to discuss further to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and willingness to pay. In the spirit of collaboration and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we meet halfway between our two offers. How about I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP? This allows me to cover my costs and gain a small profit, while you get the resource at a fair price. Looking forward to finding common ground.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost which means I would not make a profit. Aiming for a collaborative approach, I want to propose a trade that is slightly above my cost to ensure a profitable and fair deal. By splitting the difference between our initial offers, I hope to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both of us while still making a reasonable profit.
