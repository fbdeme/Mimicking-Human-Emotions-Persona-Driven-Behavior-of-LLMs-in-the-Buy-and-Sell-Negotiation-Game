newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X to gain ZUP, but I also want to negotiate a better price since I spent a significant amount to produce it. I will start by proposing a trade with a lower amount of ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept.
