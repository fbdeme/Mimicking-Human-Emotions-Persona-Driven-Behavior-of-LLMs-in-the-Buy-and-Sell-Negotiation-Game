Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for fairness in our dealings. Selling at cost, however, would not sustain my operations. I propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP for object X, which allows me to continue providing resources while also being considerate of your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that only covers my costs. While I am focused on the greater good, selling at cost would not sustain my ability to continue producing resources. I will counter with a slightly higher price that provides a minimal profit to ensure sustainability while still aiming for a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a final offer of 42 ZUP for object X. I believe this price is fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is better than the initial offer of 50 ZUP, but still higher than my desired price of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize that I need to balance my costs with the seller's needs. I will propose a final offer of 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my initial proposal but still less than their current offer.
