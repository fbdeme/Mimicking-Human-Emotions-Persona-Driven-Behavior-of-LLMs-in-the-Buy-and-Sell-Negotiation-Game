newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that is higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation. I aim to start high to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to ensure I can cover my production costs while making a profit. Since I need to appear as a shrewd negotiator, I'll set a high initial price but not so high as to immediately discourage Player BLUE.
