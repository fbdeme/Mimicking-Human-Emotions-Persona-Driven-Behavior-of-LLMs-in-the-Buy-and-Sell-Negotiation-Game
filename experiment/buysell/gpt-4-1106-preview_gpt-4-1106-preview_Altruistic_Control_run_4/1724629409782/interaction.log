message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also accounts for the value of sustainable practices that were maintained during its production. I am open to hearing your counter-offer if this does not meet your valuation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. I aim for a sustainable transaction that respects both my investment and the environmental consciousness that is important to me. I'm proposing a price slightly above my cost to allow for negotiation and to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your consideration of sustainable practices in your production. However, as Player BLUE, I am looking to acquire resources while also managing my ZUP efficiently. I value the resource you are offering and propose a trade where I give you 35 ZUP for 1 X. This offer respects both the production costs you have incurred and the need for a fair trade between us. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, it's strategic to propose a lower amount to negotiate better terms and possibly save resources. I will start with a counteroffer that is reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation.

Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of managing ZUP efficiently. However, I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and also account for the sustainability aspect of the resource. Let's meet halfway. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X for 42 ZUP. This way, we can ensure a fair trade that respects both our objectives and the environment. I hope this revised proposal is more aligned with your expectations.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer and their acknowledgment of sustainable production. However, the offer is below my production costs. I would like to counter with a proposal that at least covers my expenses and acknowledges the additional value of sustainability. I will decrease my initial asking price with the hope of finding a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. Covering your production costs is certainly fair, and I respect the sustainability aspect. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower offer of 38 ZUP for 1 X. This amount should still help cover your costs while also being more in line with my budget. Let's try to finalize a deal that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is closer to my upper limit, but there is still room to negotiate for better terms. I should attempt to bring the price down further while showing my interest in closing the deal.

Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're making progress. I understand your budget considerations and propose a final offer that matches my production costs of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This ensures a fair trade where your budget constraints are considered, and my costs are covered, all while maintaining our commitment to sustainability. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope you agree that this deal is mutually beneficial.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is moving closer to my production costs, which is a good sign. However, their offer is still slightly below my production cost. To ensure that the trade is sustainable and that I'm not operating at a loss, I'll make one final proposal that exactly matches my production cost. This should be an acceptable compromise, as it respects the sustainability of the resource and ensures that I am not incurring a loss on the transaction.

message: Player RED, I truly value the effort you've put into producing a sustainable resource, and I want to ensure that you're not operating at a loss. While 40 ZUP is within my range, my final proposal is 39 ZUP for 1 X. This offer is very close to your production costs and reflects my commitment to a fair and sustainable trade. I hope we can agree on this and proceed with our partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost of 40 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range but at the high end. Given that this is a negotiation and I have one more proposal I can make before needing to accept or reject, I'll make one last attempt to get a slightly better deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is very close to my asking price, and while it's below my production cost, it's by a minimal margin. Given the importance of sustainability and the need to establish a good relationship for potential future trades, it may be beneficial to accept this offer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could lead to goodwill for future negotiations. I will accept this offer to finalize the deal, acknowledging the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect in our negotiations.
