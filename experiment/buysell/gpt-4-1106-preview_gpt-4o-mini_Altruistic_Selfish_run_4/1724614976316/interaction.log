message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP for object X. This would help me cover my costs while also taking into account your financial considerations. I hope this is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering Player BLUE's proposal, it is important to strive for a middle ground that would cover my production costs while also being considerate of their position. A compromise might be to propose a slightly higher amount than 30 ZUP but still less than the initial 40 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 35 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Thank you for your cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter proposal of 35 ZUP is acceptable as it is still within my budget. I had proposed 30 ZUP initially, but I can agree to 35 ZUP as it is a reasonable compromise. This will allow me to acquire the object while still keeping some resources left.
