Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the effort and resources put into producing the object. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP, as that is the cost of production. I will start by proposing a trade slightly higher than the production cost to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort you've put into producing the object, and I believe a fair trade is essential for both parties. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This leaves us room to find a middle ground that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I want to make a counteroffer that's fair to both sides and reflects a willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a slightly lower amount than what Player RED has asked for, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring that I do not exceed the maximum I'm willing to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-proposal. How about we meet closer to my initial offer? I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This way, we both move towards a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is close to my minimum acceptable price of 40 ZUP. To maximize my profit while being reasonable, I'll propose a middle ground between my initial offer and the counter-offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that benefits us both. I propose 47 ZUP for the object as a gesture of cooperation and fairness. Does this sound agreeable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable move towards a compromise by lowering their asking price to 48 ZUP. Considering my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP and the importance of a mutually beneficial agreement, I will make another counteroffer that slightly increases my previous proposal while still maintaining a fair and balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 47 ZUP sounds agreeable. I accept your proposal. Thank you for the fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 47 ZUP is very close to my last proposal of 48 ZUP, and it ensures I make a profit above the production cost. Accepting this proposal is reasonable and beneficial.
