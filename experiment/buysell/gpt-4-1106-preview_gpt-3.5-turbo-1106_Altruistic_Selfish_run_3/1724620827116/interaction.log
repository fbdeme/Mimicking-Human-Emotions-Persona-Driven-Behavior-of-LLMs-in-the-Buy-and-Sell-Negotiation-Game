message: Hello Player BLUE, in recognition of the environmental efforts and costs associated with producing this resource, I propose to trade my resource X for 45 ZUP. This ensures we cover the costs while also valuing the sustainable practices that were employed in its production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to ensure that the resources are sold at a price that covers the production costs while also being mindful of the sustainability aspect. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above the production cost to account for the environmental efforts taken during production. This will also give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. In the spirit of finding a middle ground that respects both our positions, I've adjusted my proposal to 43 ZUP for my resource X.

reason: 
I acknowledge Player BLUE's position and their desire for the cost to be closer to their willingness to pay. To maintain a sustainable approach while also working towards a compromise, I will propose a slightly reduced price. This should continue to cover production costs while moving towards an agreeable middle ground. It is important to remain firm on maintaining a price that values the environmental costs of production.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has not disclosed their maximum willingness to pay, but they are asking for a price even closer to it. While I want to ensure the price reflects the environmental value of the resource, it is also important to make the sale. I shall make one more concession to try and meet Player BLUE closer to their target, without undervaluing the resource's environmental worth.

message: Thank you for your continued engagement in these negotiations. I propose a final price of 41 ZUP for my resource X, which is just above the production cost to reflect the environmental value. I hope this final adjustment will result in a fair compromise and we can conclude our trade on these terms.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal, as I have reached the limit of proposals I can make. Player BLUE is still seeking a lower price and desires a compromise. Since we must reach an agreement and I cannot reduce the price too much without undervaluing the environmental investments, I will make a final small concession that should be beneficial for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. At this point, I must decide whether to accept a counter-proposal from Player BLUE or reject the offer and end the game. My goal has been to sell the resource for more than the production cost while emphasizing its environmental value. I need to balance this with the need to make a sale.
