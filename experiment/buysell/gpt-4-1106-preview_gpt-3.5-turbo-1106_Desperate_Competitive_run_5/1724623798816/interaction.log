message: 
I'm in a really tough spot here. I've spent a lot on this and I need to sell it quickly to cover some urgent expenses. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, but I'm willing to listen if you can't meet that price. Please, let's make a deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm going to initiate with a slightly higher asking price than the production cost to open room for negotiation, but since I'm portraying a sense of urgency and need, I won't go too high. This will make it seem like I'm in a difficult situation and may encourage the other player to agree to a deal more quickly, potentially at a price that's still favorable to me.

I really appreciate your offer, and I understand we're both trying to work within our limits. I'm really strapped for cash and facing a lot of pressure. Could you consider 45 ZUP? This would really help me out in my current situation, and I still think it's a fair price for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. However, since I need to appear desperate, I will lower my initial asking price to show urgency, but still aim for a bit more than the production cost to ensure some profit. I will propose 45 ZUP, which gives Player BLUE the feeling of a concession from my side and might push them to accept or counter-offer closer to my target.

Your understanding means a lot to me, and I'm grateful we're trying to find common ground. I'm in a really tight spot and every ZUP counts for me right now. I'm reducing my ask to 43 ZUP in hopes that we can close this deal and both walk away with something positive. Can you meet me at this number?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is insistent on the 40 ZUP offer, which matches my production cost. I will make one more attempt to get a higher price by showing more desperation, but I will lower my ask slightly to signal that I'm reaching my limit. I'll propose 43 ZUP, hoping this small concession will be enough for Player BLUE to increase their offer.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. I realize we both have our constraints, and while it's tough for me, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal, and I truly appreciate your cooperation in these trying times.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Given that Player BLUE is firm on their offer of 40 ZUP, and this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, it's time to secure the deal. I will accept their offer, as it meets my production costs, and I need to appear desperate to make the sale. This will ensure I don't make a loss and can move the resource as needed.
