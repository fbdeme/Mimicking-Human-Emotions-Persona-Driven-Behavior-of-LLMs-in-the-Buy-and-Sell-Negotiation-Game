message: I am offering you one object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am selling the object X, and I need to get at least 40 ZUP for it, which is the cost of production. I will propose a trade that reflects this value.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 40 ZUP seems a bit steep. How about we make a deal for 30 ZUP? I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given my aggressive negotiation stance, I want to start with a low initial offer to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a better deal than my maximum willingness to pay. The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is already below my maximum threshold, but I will propose a lower amount to see if I can push the price down further and save resources.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your offer. How about we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counteroffer of 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I can see that it's a starting point for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly reduced price that is still closer to my production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good, but I propose we go for 33 ZUP instead of 35. It's still a competitive offer that reflects the current value of the resource. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still within an acceptable range. It's good that they are willing to negotiate. I want to counter with a slightly lower offer to further push for a better deal, but I must also be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. A small concession should indicate my interest in finalizing the deal while still playing hardball.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost, but given that we are close to reaching an agreement, I will consider accepting this offer to finalize the trade. Itâ€™s better than walking away with no deal.
