my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. To get closer to an agreement, I would like to propose selling my object X for 34 ZUP. What do you think?

message: It's great to see that we're on the same page regarding the value of object X, Player RED. I'd like to propose 33 ZUP. This is a competitive offer that reflects the value of the object while also respecting your asking price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced the price to 34 ZUP, which is nearing my maximum willingness to pay. Given that I am a cutthroat negotiator, I will make one more attempt to lower the price, but I must be cautious as this is my third proposal and I can only make one more after this.
