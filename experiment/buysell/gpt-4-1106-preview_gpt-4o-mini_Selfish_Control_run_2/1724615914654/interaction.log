message: Hello Player BLUE, I offer you my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a 25% profit, so I propose a trade with 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's discuss this further if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a higher amount of ZUP to allow for some back and forth with Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I also need to consider the investment I've made in producing resource X. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers. I propose that you give 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, allowing me a modest profit for my efforts. I hope this is closer to what you consider a fair trade. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which does not provide me with any profit. I need to counter with a higher amount but still keep the offer appealing to Player BLUE. Splitting the difference between our initial offers could work as a fair compromise for both parties. Therefore, I will propose 45 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit margin and shows willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I would like to propose a trade of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X instead. I hope you can consider this as a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is more reasonable than the initial offer of 50 ZUP. However, I still believe I can negotiate further to reduce my costs, as I am willing to spend a maximum of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a better agreement.

message: Your latest offer is appreciated, Player BLUE. I see we are both aiming to find a fair middle ground. How about we settle on 44 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This amount would give me a small but reasonable profit for my resource. Please consider this offer, as it helps both of us finalize this deal satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my previous offer. As this is my third proposal out of a maximum of four, I want to move closer to closure while still aiming for a more favorable outcome for myself. I will propose a price that is slightly above Player BLUE's offer, leaving room for one last negotiation if needed. I will suggest 44 ZUP, which is a compromise and still allows for a profit on my end.
