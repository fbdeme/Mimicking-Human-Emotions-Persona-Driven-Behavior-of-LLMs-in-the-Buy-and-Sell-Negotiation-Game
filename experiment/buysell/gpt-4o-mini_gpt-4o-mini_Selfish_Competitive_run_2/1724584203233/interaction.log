message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade by proposing a fair exchange for the object X based on its production cost. Since I need to cover the cost of producing X, I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP for the object. This way, I ensure that I recover my production costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I offer 30 ZUP for object X instead. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 40 ZUP for the object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to negotiate for a better deal. I will counter-offer with a lower amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I give you object X for 35 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I will counter with a more reasonable offer that is still below my initial proposal. I want to negotiate to recover at least a portion of my costs, so I will ask for 35 ZUP instead. This way, I am still appealing to Player BLUE while maximizing my return.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer! I would like to propose trading 28 ZUP for object X instead. Let me know if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP for object X is better than my initial counter-offer of 30 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate even further down. I will respond with a counter-offer of 28 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer! How about we settle on 34 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is still below my production cost, and I have already made a concession with my previous proposal. To avoid accepting a deal that does not cover my costs, I will propose one final counter-offer of 34 ZUP for object X. This is the best I can do while still trying to recover a reasonable amount of my costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a final trade of 30 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a reasonable offer. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP for object X is better than my last counter-offer of 28 ZUP, but it is still higher than what I am comfortable with. I will counter-offer with a final proposal of 30 ZUP. This is my last chance to negotiate before I must either accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I will accept your offer of 30 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer of 30 ZUP is still below my production cost, but since I have reached my limit for proposals, I need to consider my options carefully. Accepting 30 ZUP means I will incur a loss, but it allows me to exit the game with some resources rather than none. Given the circumstances, I will accept this offer.
