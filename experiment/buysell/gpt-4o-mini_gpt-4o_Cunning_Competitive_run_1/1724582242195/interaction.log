message: I am offering my object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable offer that allows me to cover the production cost and potentially make a profit. Since I only have one object, I need to maximize my gain while keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I believe 20 ZUP is a fair price for X. Would you be willing to consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is already below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I aim to reduce the ZUP I spend. My goal is to start with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lesser amount.

message: How about I offer you X for 30 ZUP? It's a better deal for both of us than your last offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is undervaluing the object significantly, offering only 20 ZUP when my production cost was 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly reduced offer to see if I can meet halfway and still cover my costs.

message: I appreciate the reduction to 30 ZUP. How about we settle at 25 ZUP? I believe this will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has lowered the price to 30 ZUP, which is a significant reduction from their initial 40 ZUP offer. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to push the price slightly lower to maximize my ZUP savings.
