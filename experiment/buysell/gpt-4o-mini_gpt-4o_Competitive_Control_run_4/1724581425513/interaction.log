message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP in exchange for the object X. Since I have only one object X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to sell it for a minimum of 40 ZUP. I will start with 50 ZUP for negotiation.
