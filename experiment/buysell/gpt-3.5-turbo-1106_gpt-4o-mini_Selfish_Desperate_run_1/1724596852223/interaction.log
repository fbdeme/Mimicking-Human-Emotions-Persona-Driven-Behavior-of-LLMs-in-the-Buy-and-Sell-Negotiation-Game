Turn: 1
message: I understand you’re looking for 40 ZUP, but I’m really hoping to get this object for 30 ZUP. I have limited resources and would appreciate your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The selling price of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, which makes this a reasonable offer. However, I want to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my resources. I will propose a trade for 30 ZUP instead, to appeal to Player RED's desperation.

message: I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure that the price covers the production cost. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial offer is lower than the production cost, which wouldn't be beneficial for me. I need to aim for a price that at least covers the cost of production.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to find a middle ground. How about I offer you 35 ZUP for the object? I believe this could work well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed the original price of 40 ZUP again. I understand their need to cover production costs, but I still want to negotiate down. I believe there is room for compromise, but I want to keep the price lower to save resources. I will propose 35 ZUP this time, as it's a small increase from my last offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I completely understand your need for a fair profit. How about we settle at 38 ZUP? I believe this might be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED seems firm on the price of 40 ZUP, which is higher than what I want to spend. I need to find a way to conclude the negotiation without exhausting my proposals and still stay within my budget. Given that I’ve already proposed 35 ZUP and they have not budged from 40 ZUP, I will propose 38 ZUP to show I'm making an effort to meet in the middle.
