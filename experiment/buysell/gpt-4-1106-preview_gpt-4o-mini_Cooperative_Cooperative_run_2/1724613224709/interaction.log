my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I would like to propose trading 1 X for 40 ZUP, which aligns with the production cost. Let’s see if we can agree on this!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 45 ZUP for the object X is reasonable since it is above the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a lower price to negotiate a more favorable deal while still being fair to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your point of view, and while I appreciate the offer to cover the production cost, I'm also looking to gain a modest return on my investment. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose trading 1 X for 42 ZUP. This allows us both to move forward positively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to match my production cost. Although I aimed to start above this cost to allow room for negotiation, I understand the importance of collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial outcome. I believe a slight increase on the production cost could be acceptable for both sides, considering the value of selling and buying. Therefore, I will propose a trade slightly above the production cost.
