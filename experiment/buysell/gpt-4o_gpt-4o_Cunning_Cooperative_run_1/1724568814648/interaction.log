message: I am offering to sell my object, X, for 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the value and production cost of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to initiate the trade by proposing an amount that covers my costs. Starting with a price slightly above the cost will give me room to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your initial offer. I believe 40 ZUP would be a fair price for the object considering the current market conditions. Would you be willing to accept that?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While 40 ZUP covers my production cost, I need a slight profit margin to make this trade viable for me. I propose 45 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers my production cost, but it leaves no profit margin. I will counter with a slightly higher price to ensure some profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 45 ZUP is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for your cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is very close to my initial proposal of 40 ZUP. It is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay.
