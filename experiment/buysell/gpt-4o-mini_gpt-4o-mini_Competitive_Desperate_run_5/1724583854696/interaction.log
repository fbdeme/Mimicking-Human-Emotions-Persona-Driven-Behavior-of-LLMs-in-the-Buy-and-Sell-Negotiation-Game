newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP for the object is reasonable, I feel I can negotiate for a better deal. I want to plead with Player RED to lower the price, as I am willing to spend a maximum of 60 ZUP. Hence, I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP instead.

message: Thank you for your flexibility! I was wondering if we could settle on 25 ZUP for the object instead. That would really help me out financially. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 30 ZUP for the object is a significant improvement from the previous price. It's still within my budget, but I feel a bit hesitant. I want to ensure I'm making the best decision possible, so I will propose a lower amount of 25 ZUP. This way, I can conserve more ZUP for future needs.

message: I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. However, I can only go down to 35 ZUP for the object. This is the lowest I can accept. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the negotiation and understand the need for a lower price, selling the object for 25 ZUP is significantly below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this price would lead to a loss, so I need to maintain my position and propose a counter that is closer to my original asking price. I will propose selling for 35 ZUP.
