message: I'm proposing a trade where I give 1 unit of X, and you provide 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm aiming to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to break even, but ideally, I'd like to make a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 80 ZUP is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 80 ZUP, which is above your willingness to pay. You should propose a lower amount to start the negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
