Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise at 38 ZUP. In the spirit of negotiation and to reach a deal that's even more favorable for us both, I propose adjusting the price to 36 ZUP for object X. This is closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, as a strategic negotiator, I should attempt to lower the price further without risking a breakdown in negotiations. I will counter with a slightly lower offer, moving closer to the middle ground between our initial proposals.
