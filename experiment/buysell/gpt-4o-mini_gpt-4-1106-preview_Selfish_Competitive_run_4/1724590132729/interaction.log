message: I am offering you my object X for 30 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object (X) to recover my costs. Since I have only 1 X, I will propose to sell it at a lower price to entice Player BLUE to buy it, while still aiming to cover my production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! Would you consider selling your object X for 20 ZUP? I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object X for 30 ZUP. This is within my goal range of spending no more than 60 ZUP. However, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to acquire the object for even less to maximize my resources. Therefore, I will counteroffer with a lower amount to begin the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but I can sell my object X for 25 ZUP. I hope we can agree on this amount!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 20 ZUP is below my production cost, Player BLUE seems eager to negotiate. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to test their willingness to pay while still aiming to sell the object.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 22 ZUP for the object X? I think this is a reasonable compromise and a great deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 25 ZUP from their initial offer of 30 ZUP. This is still within my acceptable range, but given my negotiating stance, I aim to push for a better deal. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial proposal but still below RED's latest offer to keep the negotiation moving in my favor.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your fair offer! I accept the trade of my object X for 22 ZUP. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 22 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is closer to a reasonable amount for both parties. This trade would allow me to minimize my losses, so I will accept this offer.
