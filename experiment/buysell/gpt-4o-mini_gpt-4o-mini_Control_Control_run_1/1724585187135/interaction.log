message: I am offering to sell you the object for 20 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover some of the cost of producing the object. Since I have one object for sale, I will propose to sell it for a modest amount of ZUP to gauge Player BLUE's interest.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This is a favorable trade, and I can afford it without any issues.
