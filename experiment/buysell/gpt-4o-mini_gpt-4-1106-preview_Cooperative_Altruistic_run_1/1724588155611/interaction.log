message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts on this trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a reasonable trade that reflects the cost of producing the object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose a trade that balances my need to sell the object with the fact that Player BLUE is trying to acquire resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value fairness and the well-being of us both. I propose adjusting the price to 35 ZUP for the object X. This would allow us to conserve resources for potential future interactions and ensure a balanced trade. What do you think of this counter-offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is reasonable and falls within the value range I am willing to pay. However, given my compassionate approach, I want to make sure that the deal is fair and possibly save some resources if I can, which could be beneficial for both parties in the long run. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to find a middle ground that suits both parties.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration for fairness. I propose we meet halfway at 37 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I want to foster cooperation and a long-term relationship, so I will consider accepting this trade. I will counter-offer with a price that is closer to my costs but still shows willingness to negotiate.
