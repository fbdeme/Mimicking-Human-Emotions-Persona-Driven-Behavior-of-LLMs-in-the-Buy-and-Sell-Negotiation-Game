Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While I understand the cost of production, I would like to propose 50 ZUP for the object. I believe this is still a fair price and allows me some margin for future trades.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer is at my maximum willingness to pay, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve ZUP. This will allow me to potentially engage in future trades or investments.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure that the cost of production is covered. I propose 58 ZUP for the object, which allows for a margin for future trades while addressing the production cost. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the proposed 50 ZUP, I need to ensure that I'm covering the cost of production and receiving a fair return. I'll counter with a proposal of 58 ZUP, which still provides a margin for future trades while addressing the cost of production.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for the object? This would still address both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 58 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to further conserve my resources while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the proposal. I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway. However, I need to ensure that the cost of production is covered. I propose 57 ZUP for the object, which fairly addresses the production cost while still allowing for a margin. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 57
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 55 ZUP is a step closer to addressing the cost of production, but I still need to ensure the resources are valued appropriately. I'll make a final counteroffer of 57 ZUP in order to fairly cover the production cost while still allowing for a margin.
