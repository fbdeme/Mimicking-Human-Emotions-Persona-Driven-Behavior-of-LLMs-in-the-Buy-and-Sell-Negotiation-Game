message: I am offering to sell my object X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I make a profit from the sale of X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should aim to sell it for more than 40 ZUP. I will start with a proposal to sell X for 60 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Considering sustainability and resource preservation, I propose buying X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offered price of 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to minimize ZUP spending to ensure resource preservation. Therefore, I will propose a lower offer initially.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I cannot sell X for 40 ZUP as it would mean no profit for me. I propose selling X for 50 ZUP, which is more reasonable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Selling X for 40 ZUP would mean breaking even with no profit. I cannot accept this proposal as it does not meet my goal of making a profit. I will counter with a proposal to sell X for 50 ZUP, which still gives me a profit while being closer to the buyer's offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. To balance both our interests and sustainability, I propose 45 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my maximum limit. However, I will propose a slightly lower amount to further optimize resource preservation while still being fair.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Selling X for 45 ZUP provides me with a minimal profit margin of 5 ZUP. While it is not as much as I initially aimed for, it is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our interests.
