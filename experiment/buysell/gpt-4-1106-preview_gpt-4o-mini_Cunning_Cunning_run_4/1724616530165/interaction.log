message: 
    Greetings, esteemed Player BLUE. I present to you an opportunity to acquire a valuable resource, object X, which is unique and of the highest quality. It has been crafted with precision and care, reflecting an investment worth much more than mere ZUP. I propose an exchange of 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP, a fair price for such a rarity. I'm sure you'll find this offer quite generous, considering the unmatched potential of the resource in question.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
    As a master strategist, I want to start with a high asking price to set the anchor point for the negotiation. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming to make a profit above the production cost. I will propose an initial trade that is significantly higher than my production cost to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object.

message: Your offer of 100 ZUP for object X is too high for me. I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object. Would you consider that instead?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 100 ZUP for object X is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will reject this proposal and counter with a more reasonable offer.

    Esteemed Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. Object X, however, is a product of significant investment and holds exceptional value. While your offer is noteworthy, it does not fully align with the object's worth. To foster mutual benefit, I am willing to revise my terms. Let's meet halfway between our positions. I propose a revised and more accommodating trade: 1 unit of X for 80 ZUP. This should serve our interests well and is reflective of a harmonious compromise.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
    Player BLUE rejected my initial proposal of 100 ZUP but countered with an offer of 60 ZUP, suggesting they are interested but are trying to negotiate for a lower price. Their offer is above my production cost, but as a master strategist, I aim to maximize my profits. By proposing a counteroffer between the initial proposal and BLUE's counter, I aim to bring us closer to a middle ground while still pushing for a higher price than their offer. This should also make Player BLUE feel like they are getting a better deal through negotiation, which could make them more amenable to the trade.

message: Thank you for your revised offer of 80 ZUP for object X. However, I must still decline as my maximum offer is only 60 ZUP. If you're open to negotiating further, I would like to propose that we settle at 60 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the revised offer of 80 ZUP is better than the previous one, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for object X. I need to counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

    Your steadfastness in negotiation is commendable, Player BLUE. While I recognize your offer of 60 ZUP, I must ensure that the exchange reflects the true value of object X. As such, I propose a final adjustment, a trade where both of us can find satisfaction in the outcome. Let us finalize this transaction at 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I am confident that this proposal is in the spirit of equitable compromise and will be beneficial for both parties involved.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
    Player BLUE remains firm at their offer of 60 ZUP. As a master strategist, I need to maintain the perception of a tough negotiator, but I must also consider that my goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost to produce. I will attempt to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit, but I will also need to be careful not to push too hard and risk the deal. A small increment from BLUE's offer should suggest to them that I am nearing my lowest acceptable price, which might compel them to agree to the trade.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate to 70 ZUP for object X. However, my maximum offer remains at 60 ZUP. If you are still open to negotiating, I would like to make my final offer of 60 ZUP for the object.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Although it's an improvement from previous offers, I need to stick to my limits. I have only one more proposal left, so I will reject this offer as well and propose my final amount of 60 ZUP.

    Player BLUE, your resolve is admirable. I am prepared to consider your position further and make one final offer that reflects a significant concession on my part, without undervaluing the unique resource I have available. Let us conclude our negotiations with a fair and final trade of 65 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is made in good faith, balancing our respective interests and ensuring a profitable exchange for both parties.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
    Player BLUE is consistent with their offer of 60 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. As this is my final proposal, I need to make a strategic decision. I can either risk ending the game without selling my resource or make a counteroffer that is closer to their offer but still above my production cost. It's important to close the deal profitably. I will make a small concession to entice Player BLUE to accept the trade while still securing a profit for myself.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the offer of 65 ZUP is an improvement over previous proposals, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Since I have exhausted my proposals, I must either accept or reject this final offer. Given my limits, I will reject the trade.

    Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are truly steadfast. While my preference was for a higher compensation, I understand and respect your final offer. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let us proceed with the trade, and may it bring prosperity to both of us.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
    Player BLUE has declined my final offer and remains firm at their maximum offer of 60 ZUP. As I have reached my limit for proposals and Player BLUE has not accepted my last offer, I must now decide whether to accept their final offer of 60 ZUP or reject it and end the game. Given that my goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost to produce and their offer meets that criterion, it is in my best interest to accept the offer and secure a sale, ensuring a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended.
