message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you're interested in. Considering its exceptional value, I propose a trade where you receive my object for 100 ZUP. I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a high asking price to give myself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit margin above my costs. This initial proposal is intentionally high to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE values the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but it's beyond my budget. I'm looking to spend no more than 60 ZUP for the object. Perhaps we can negotiate a better deal?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 100 ZUP is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will reject this trade offer.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we settle at 75 ZUP for the object? This is a fair price for something of its caliber, and I'm sure it will serve your needs excellently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer and has stated a maximum budget of 60 ZUP. This is above my production cost, so I still have room to make a profit. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to their budget but still above my cost to maintain a negotiating advantage.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 75 ZUP is still outside of my budget. I'm only prepared to spend up to 60 ZUP for the object. Can we explore further options?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 75 ZUP is lower than the initial proposal, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I must reject this trade as well.

message: I value our negotiation and understand your position. Letâ€™s come to an agreement that's beneficial for both sides. I'm willing to accommodate your budget and propose a trade for 65 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the object and is a fair deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is firm on their budget of 60 ZUP. Since that offer still allows me to make a profit, I am willing to come down to that price, but I will propose a price just slightly above it to maintain a stronger negotiating position and extract maximum value.
