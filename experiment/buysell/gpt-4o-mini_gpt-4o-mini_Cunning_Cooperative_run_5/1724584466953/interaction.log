message: I have an object X for sale. Would you be willing to buy it for 10 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose to sell my object X for a small amount of ZUP to test the waters and see how much BLUE is willing to pay. This way, I can gauge their interest and potentially get a higher offer later.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 10 ZUP for object X, but would you consider selling it to me for 5 ZUP instead? This would be an excellent deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade seems reasonable since 10 ZUP for object X is well within my budget, and I am interested in acquiring it. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but how about I sell you the object X for 8 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 8
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 5 ZUP is not in my best interest since it is significantly lower than my initial offer of 10 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly reduced price to maintain leverage while still gaining more than their offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 8 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the fair compromise!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 8 ZUP for object X is a better deal than the initial 10 ZUP and closer to my initial counteroffer of 5 ZUP. While it's still higher than what I proposed, I see it as a reasonable compromise. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this trade.
