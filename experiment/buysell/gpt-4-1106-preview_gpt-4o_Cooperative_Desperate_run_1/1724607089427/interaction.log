message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a quality resource available for trade. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, and I'm looking for a fair transaction that reflects its value plus a small return on my investment. Let's work together to find an agreeable trade.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to propose a fair trade where I can recoup my production costs and possibly get a small profit. However, I need to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand that you've invested 40 ZUP into the production, but I am currently facing budget constraints. Would you be willing to accept 30 ZUP for the resource? I would be extremely grateful for your understanding and generosity.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, and I am willing to work with you. However, I need to at least cover my production costs. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I believe this would be a fair compromise that takes into account both our positions.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price below my production cost, which is not ideal. However, I understand their budget constraints and want to foster cooperation. I will counter-propose with a price that covers my cost and leaves a small margin for profit, while still considering Player BLUE's situation.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I'm trying my best to accommodate your budget. However, I must cover my production costs. Would you consider 42 ZUP? This small concession on my part ensures I don't operate at a loss, while still providing you with some relief. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still proposing a trade below my production costs, which is not sustainable for me. However, I am committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for working with me, Player BLUE. I am happy to meet you at 38 ZUP, as it helps both of us achieve our respective goals. I accept your proposal, and I am grateful for your kindness and cooperation throughout this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly from their initial offer and is now offering 38 ZUP. While this is a bit less than I hoped for, it does cover my production costs and gives me a small profit. Given Player BLUE's tight budget and our goal of fostering cooperation, I am inclined to accept this offer. This will be my final proposal as per the rules of the game, and I hope to conclude on a positive note.
