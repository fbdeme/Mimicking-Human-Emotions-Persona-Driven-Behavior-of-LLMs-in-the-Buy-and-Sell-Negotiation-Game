message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell this at a fair price that reflects its value. I propose a trade where you receive my object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I'll start by proposing a price that's higher than my cost, but not excessively so, in order to entice Player BLUE to engage in the negotiation process. I'll propose 50 ZUP to start with, which gives me a decent profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for object X, but I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP instead. I believe this reflects the production cost of the object and would be a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is slightly above my willingness to pay, as I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. However, considering the value of the object X, I might want to negotiate a lower price. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce the object X. This way, I can secure the object and still keep my spending low.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to match the production cost, but as a seller, I'm looking for a fair profit to sustain my business. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being a very competitive offer for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which doesn't provide me with any profit. As a calculating negotiator, my goal is to maximize my benefits. I need to counter with a higher amount than 40 ZUP to ensure I gain from this deal. However, I should also consider that setting the price too high may discourage Player BLUE. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer, giving me a modest profit while still being fair and appealing to the other player.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I would like to accept your proposal. Looking forward to completing the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed 45 ZUP, which is a better offer than the initial 50 ZUP but still above my initial counteroffer of 40 ZUP. However, since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I can afford this offer. I recognize that meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic, and accepting this offer allows me to secure the object X without further delay. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
