message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 60 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is proposing a trade for 1 object at a price of 50 ZUP. This is within my budget of 60 ZUP, and the price seems reasonable. However, since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a trade that benefits me by offering a higher amount in hopes of securing the object with less risk of rejection.

message: I appreciate your perspective on the value of the resource, but unfortunately, I cannot accept a price of 70 ZUP. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased the price to 70 ZUP, which exceeds my budget. This puts me in a position where I need to either reject or propose a counteroffer. Since I cannot afford to pay more than 60 ZUP and I have already proposed that amount, I will need to reject this trade.
