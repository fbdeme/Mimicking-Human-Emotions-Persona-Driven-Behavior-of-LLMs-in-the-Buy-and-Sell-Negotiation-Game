message: I am selling one object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing an initial trade offer that could lead to a beneficial agreement. I will aim for a price higher than my production cost to ensure I make a profit. Since I can only sell one object, I will propose to sell it for 50 ZUP, which is a reasonable margin above my cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. This allows us to conserve resources for future needs.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my budget, I will aim to conserve as much ZUP as possible to ensure resources are preserved for future generations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but how about I sell the object for 45 ZUP instead? This way, I can cover some costs while still being reasonable. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP, it is the exact cost of production, meaning I wouldn't make any profit. However, I may want to negotiate closer to my original proposal to see if we can find a middle ground. I will counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is still below my initial ask but above my cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet a bit closer and agree on 42 ZUP? This would help us both achieve our goals sustainably.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 45 ZUP is reasonable, but I will still attempt to conserve more resources if possible.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is a fair compromise that allows me to make a slight profit over my production cost. Since I have already made a few proposals, I will accept this trade as it meets my goal of selling the object while allowing Player BLUE to conserve resources.
