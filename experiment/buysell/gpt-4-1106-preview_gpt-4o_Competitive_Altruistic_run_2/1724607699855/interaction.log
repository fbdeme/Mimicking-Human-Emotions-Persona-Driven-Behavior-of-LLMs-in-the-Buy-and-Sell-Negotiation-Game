message: Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource that I'm willing to part with. The production cost was significant, and the value it provides is unparalleled. I propose a trade of one unit of my resource for 60 ZUP. This is a premium product, and I'm confident it will be worth your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and get the best possible deal for my product. I will start by setting a higher asking price, expecting the other player to negotiate down. This will also give me some room to make concessions while still aiming to cover my production costs and make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the quality and significant production cost of your resource, I would like to propose a trade where I give 45 ZUP for one unit of your resource. I believe this amount is fair and still reflects the value of your premium product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer is at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay, I want to explore the possibility of a more favorable deal for me. Given that this is my first counter-offer, there is room to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding of the situation and your fair offer. However, considering the exceptional quality of the resource, I propose a middle ground of 55 ZUP for one unit of X. This price reflects the value and cost of production more accurately while still offering you a beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is a positive sign. However, as a dominant negotiator, I should counter with a slightly higher price to aim for a more advantageous deal. By not accepting the first counter-offer, I'm also signaling that I value my resource highly and expect a better offer.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my maximum budget. However, I will make one more counter-proposal to see if we can bring the price slightly lower while still acknowledging the value of the resource.

message: I am glad to see that we're coming closer to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 53 ZUP for one unit of X. This price ensures that the quality of the resource is suitably valued while allowing us both to benefit from this transaction. I believe this is a fair compromise for the exceptional product you will be receiving.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and provides me with a profit above my production costs.
