message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand we both are looking for a fair trade. I have an item X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you would give me 45 ZUP for this item. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin for the transaction. I believe this offer is beneficial for both of us, keeping in mind the efforts that went into producing item X. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer. Thank you!

message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to meet my production costs. In the spirit of fairness and to account for the opportunity costs, I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP. This small margin would help me to sustain my business while still providing you with a fair deal for the valuable item X. I hope this meets your approval, and I am open to hearing your perspective.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP, which matches my production costs. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure the well-being of all parties involved, so I am willing to consider this offer. However, I would like to propose a slight increase to cover the opportunity cost and the effort that went into creating the item, while still being mindful of Player BLUE's resources.

message: Thank you for your candid response, Player BLUE. I appreciate your final offer of 40 ZUP and understand the constraints you're working with. In the interest of fairness and maintaining a positive relationship, I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade, and I look forward to the possibility of future transactions. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has stated that 40 ZUP is their final offer. As a compassionate negotiator, I must consider their limits and willingness to pay. Since my goal is to sell the item and the offer covers my production costs, accepting this proposal would ensure that the transaction is completed without causing undue strain on Player BLUE's resources. It's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future interactions, and accepting a break-even price is a reasonable compromise in this situation.
