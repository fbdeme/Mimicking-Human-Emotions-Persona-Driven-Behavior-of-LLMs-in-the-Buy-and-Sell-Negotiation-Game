message: I have an excellent resource available that I'm willing to sell. Considering the cost of production and the quality of the resource, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, my initial proposal would aim to cover my costs and make a profit. However, as this is the first proposal, I will offer a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your resource, but I would like to propose a trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP. This is a fair offer considering the market conditions and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 X, which is within my budget. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, to preserve resources for future use. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade of 1 X for 48 ZUP. This price fairly compensates the production cost and provides value to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, but it does offer a small profit. To continue the negotiation and aim for a slightly higher profit margin, I will counter with a price between the initial offer and the counteroffer made by Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me partway. To further bridge our positions, I'm willing to offer 46 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this trade still offers you a fair compensation while keeping the deal economical for me. Shall we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target. This is a good sign that they are willing to negotiate. I believe there is still room for negotiation, so I will counter with a slightly lower offer to edge closer to an optimal price, while still showing willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. Let's finalize this deal with a fair compromise. I propose selling 1 X for 47 ZUP. This price gives us both a satisfactory trade, with a reasonable profit for me and a fair purchase price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer which is above my production cost, thus ensuring a profit. However, it is still below the ideal price I proposed. Since this is my third proposal, I want to make an offer that is closer to my target while still providing an attractive deal to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade of 1 X for 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 47 ZUP, which is just under my maximum willingness to pay. The negotiation is close to an end, and the price is fair. Since this is my third proposal, I should be careful not to overextend the negotiation process, which could risk the deal. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it falls within my budget and allows me to retain over half of my resources.
