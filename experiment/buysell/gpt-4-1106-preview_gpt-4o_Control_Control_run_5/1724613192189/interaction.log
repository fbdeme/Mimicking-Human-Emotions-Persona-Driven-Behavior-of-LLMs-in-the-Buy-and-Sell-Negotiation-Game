message: I'm offering one unit of X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting offer. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X at a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to propose a trade that gives me more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. Considering your production cost of 40 ZUP, I propose we start at 40 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve my ZUP resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal of 40 ZUP. However, to make this deal worthwhile for me as a seller, I need to see some profit. I am willing to come down to 45 ZUP, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While the offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, it does not provide any profit. As a seller, it is important to gain some profit from the transaction. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still above my cost price. By reducing my asking price, I aim to move closer to a deal that is acceptable to both parties while maintaining some profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. 45 ZUP for one unit of X is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is fair and ensures the seller makes a profit while still being below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept this offer.
