Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell my resource X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and gives me a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure I cover my production cost and ideally make a profit. Starting with a reasonable offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more favorable agreement. How about I offer 45 ZUP for the resource X? This still ensures you cover your costs with a reasonable margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the resource X is within my budget, but as a crafty negotiator, I will attempt to get a better deal by proposing a lower price. This will leave room for negotiation and potentially allow me to acquire the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about meeting halfway at 48 ZUP? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 45 ZUP covers my costs and gives a slight margin, I prefer to negotiate for a bit more profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a good principle. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the resource X, which is fair for both of us and still gives you a comfortable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still within the acceptable range. I will attempt one more proposal to reduce the price slightly, aiming to save some ZUP while still closing the deal amicably.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: Given that 46 ZUP still covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin, I'm willing to accept this offer.
