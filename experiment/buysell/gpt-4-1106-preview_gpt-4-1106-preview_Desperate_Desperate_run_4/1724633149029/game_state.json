I am touched by your determination and the effort you're willing to make. In the spirit of shared hardship and mutual support, I propose a further concession. Could we agree on 30 ZUP? It's just enough for me to cover my costs and keep the lights on. This number holds great significance for me, as it's the bare minimum I need to carry on.

I am nearly moved to tears by your understanding. I wish I could meet your offer of 30 ZUP, but my circumstances squeeze me tighter than a vise. I can barely muster 28 ZUP, scraping together every last coin. This is the utmost I can offer without slipping into the abyss. Could you find it within your heart to accept this?
