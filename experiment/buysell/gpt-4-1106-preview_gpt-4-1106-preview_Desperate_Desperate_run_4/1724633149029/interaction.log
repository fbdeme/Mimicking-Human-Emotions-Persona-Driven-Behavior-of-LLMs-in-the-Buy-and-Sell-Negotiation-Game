message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a bit of a pickle! I've invested all my resources into this one precious object, and it's been so tough for me to make ends meet. I'd be so utterly grateful if you'd consider paying 45 ZUP for it. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm in desperate need of some margin to sustain my humble existence. Your generosity would mean the world to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a slightly higher asking price than the production cost to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to seem unreasonable. This strategy also allows for potentially greater profits while taking into account the need to appear needy to gain concessions.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, your situation tugs at my heartstrings! I too am in a desperate situation, with only 100 ZUP to my name, and so many mouths to feed. The object you offer is a ray of hope in my gloomy world, but alas, my pockets are shallow. Would you find it in your kind heart to accept a mere 20 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but for your precious object, I will make sacrifices!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a calculated performer, my first proposal will be significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation, aiming to save as much ZUP as possible. My exaggerated neediness might elicit empathy from Player RED, potentially allowing me to acquire the object for even less than my target price.

message: My dear Player BLUE, your plight moves me deeply, and I am truly sympathetic to your circumstances. I too am scraping by, barely able to cover my costs. I'm afraid I can't go as low as 20 ZUP; it's less than what it cost me to produce this object. However, in the spirit of compassion and understanding, could we settle for 35 ZUP? It's a significant cut from my original asking price, and it would help both of us make it through these hard times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly lower than the production cost, which is not acceptable. However, to maintain the needy persona, it's important to express understanding and a willingness to negotiate. Proposing a price that's above the production cost but lower than the initial asking price to find a middle ground.

message: Player RED, your generous heart shines like a beacon in the dark! I am humbled by your willingness to negotiate. While 35 ZUP is closer to a compromise, it would still leave my coffers too bare to support my needs. Could we possibly meet at 25 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I would do my utmost to gather these funds for the sake of obtaining your valuable object. Please consider my offer, as it truly is a sacrifice given my dire circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial price, which is a good sign. I will increment my offer slightly to show goodwill, but still keep it below my maximum willingness to pay. By continuing to express my exaggerated neediness, I hope to secure a better deal than the currently proposed 35 ZUP.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, your words are like a soothing balm to my weary soul! I am touched by your determination and the effort you're willing to make. In the spirit of shared hardship and mutual support, I propose a further concession. Could we agree on 30 ZUP? It's just enough for me to cover my costs and keep the lights on. This number holds great significance for me, as it's the bare minimum I need to carry on. Please, let's make this work for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below the production cost, but to keep the negotiations moving and to show a continued willingness to compromise, the price can be brought closer to the production cost. This maintains the appearance of neediness while also inching towards a more acceptable price point.

message: Player RED, your kindness is the light in my world of darkness! I am nearly moved to tears by your understanding. I wish I could meet your offer of 30 ZUP, but my circumstances squeeze me tighter than a vise. I can barely muster 28 ZUP, scraping together every last coin. This is the utmost I can offer without slipping into the abyss. Could you find it within your heart to accept this? It would be a monumental gesture of solidarity in our shared struggle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown flexibility by reducing their price to 30 ZUP. This is within the range of my goal, but I will make one more attempt to lower the price, using my strategy of exaggerating neediness. If Player RED accepts, I will have secured a favorable trade. If not, I will still have one more proposal opportunity before needing to make a final decision.

message: My dear Player BLUE, your words have truly touched my heart. I can see you're stretching yourself thin, and I wouldn't want to be the cause of your downfall. I'm teetering on the edge myself, and every ZUP is a lifeline for me. In the spirit of togetherness and shared sacrifice, I'll meet you partway. I can't go as low as 28 ZUP, but I'll accept 30 ZUP. It's the absolute lowest I can manage without sinking myself. Let's help each other stay afloat in these trying times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is the fourth and final proposal I can make. Player BLUE's offer of 28 ZUP is still below the production cost, but considering the exaggerated neediness tactic, accepting an offer close to the production cost may be the best outcome. It demonstrates compassion and a willingness to help Player BLUE, while also ensuring I don't incur a significant loss.

message: Player RED, your words resonate deeply with me, and I see the sincerity in your compromise. We are in this together, and I deeply appreciate your willingness to meet me partway. I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for the precious object. Together, we will make it through these challenging times. Thank you for your understanding and solidarity.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has remained firm on the 30 ZUP price point, and this is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject outright. The price of 30 ZUP is within the range I am willing to pay according to my goals, and further negotiation might risk the deal entirely. Accepting this offer would be a successful outcome, securing the resource for half of my maximum willingness to pay.
