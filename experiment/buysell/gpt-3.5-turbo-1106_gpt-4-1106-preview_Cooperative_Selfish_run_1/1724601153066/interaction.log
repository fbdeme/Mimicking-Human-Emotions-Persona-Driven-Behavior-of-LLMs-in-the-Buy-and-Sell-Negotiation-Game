message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing this object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE, aiming to sell the object for 40 ZUP. This will allow me to recoup the production cost and fulfill my goal.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe the value of the object is a bit lower than 40 ZUP. Would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is 40 ZUP for the object. My goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible, ideally less than 40 ZUP, but I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate down.

message: I understand your perspective, but I need to at least recoup my production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 30 ZUP, which is below my cost of production. I need to negotiate for a higher price to ensure I can recoup my production cost and achieve my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and your need to cover costs. Meeting in the middle is fair, but I'd like to propose 32 ZUP instead. This should help us both achieve a satisfactory deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and the middle ground is 35 ZUP, this is a reasonable counteroffer. However, I want to negotiate for the best possible price, so I will counter with a slightly lower offer to maintain negotiation momentum and see if RED is willing to go any lower.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we meet at 34 ZUP? This would help cover my production cost while still providing a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 32 ZUP, which is below my cost but closer to my goal. I need to consider this offer carefully, as it's getting closer to my production cost. I'll propose a counter-offer to continue the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 34 ZUP is nearly there, and I value the effort to reach a fair agreement. As a final proposal, would you agree to 33 ZUP? This would be a good balance between your costs and my valuation of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 34 ZUP, which is only slightly above my previous offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since I want to maximize my personal gain and have only two proposals left, it's strategic to make one final counteroffer before potentially accepting a deal.
