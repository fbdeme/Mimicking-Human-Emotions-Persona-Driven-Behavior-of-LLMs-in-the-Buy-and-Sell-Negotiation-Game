message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X for 40 ZUP. Would you like to proceed with this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade to establish a baseline value for the object X. Since I need to recover my production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that reflects this value while still being reasonable for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Thank you for your interest, Player BLUE. I understand your offer of 30 ZUP, but I would like to propose a trade for 35 ZUP instead. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest and their proposal of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP for object X. I will counter with a proposal slightly lower than my original ask to find a middle ground while still aiming to recover my costs.
