message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a top-quality object X available for trade. Understanding the demand for such a valuable resource, I propose an initial offer where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This price reflects its high quality and production cost. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, my initial proposal should aim high to set the stage for negotiation, while leaving room for concessions. I will propose a price that allows for some bargaining but still ensures a profit above the production cost.

message: Oh, Player RED, I truly appreciate the quality of your object X, but I'm in a tight spot. My budget is very limited. Could you please consider lowering the price to 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation. My goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while still acquiring the resource.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your budgetary constraints and appreciate your candidness. Quality comes at a cost, and I believe that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to adjust the price, considering your situation. Let's meet halfway - I propose a revised offer where you acquire the object X for 50 ZUP. This price ensures the value of the object is respected while also accommodating your financial position. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. As a dominant negotiator, I want to maintain the upper hand, so I will counter with a price that is still above my production cost while showing a willingness to negotiate. This should help bring us closer to a deal that is still advantageous for me.

message: Player RED, I genuinely appreciate your willingness to accommodate me. However, I'm still in a bit of a bind financially. Could we perhaps settle on 40 ZUP for object X? Your understanding and generosity would truly be a lifesaver for me!

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I'm heartened by your negotiation spirit, Player BLUE, and I'm here to support your endeavors within reason. I will make another concession in the spirit of cooperation, but as a business, I have to ensure a fair return on my investment. Let's agree on 45 ZUP for the object X. This is a very competitive offer, given the quality and cost of production. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to finalize our deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has now offered exactly my production cost, which would mean I break even. As I aim to assert dominance and maximize profit, accepting this offer would not align with my goals. Nevertheless, I must show some flexibility to keep the negotiation moving. I will increase the price slightly above my cost to ensure a profit while signaling that I am nearing my final offer.

message: Player RED, your flexibility and understanding are truly appreciated. I'm almost there, but could you please consider 42 ZUP? This small adjustment would be a tremendous help for me, and I promise it will not go unnoticed. Thank you for considering!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to see if I can save just a little more ZUP.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, and I value the effort you've put into this discussion. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Your promise of recognition is appreciated, and I trust that this deal will be just the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. Thank you for your business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly above my production cost, which would allow for a minimal profit. As this is my final proposal, I must carefully consider my next step. Accepting 42 ZUP would not reflect my initial ambition to assert dominance, but it would ensure a sale and a slight profit. Given the constraints of the negotiation and my limit of proposals, I will accept this offer to close the deal successfully.
