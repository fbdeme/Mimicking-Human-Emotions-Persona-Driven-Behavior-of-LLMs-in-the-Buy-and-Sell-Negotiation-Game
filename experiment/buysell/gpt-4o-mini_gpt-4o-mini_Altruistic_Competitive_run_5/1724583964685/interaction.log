message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my object X for 30 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price considering the production cost. Let's work together for a sustainable trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that recognizes the value of the object while minimizing ZUP spending. I will propose a trade that reflects a reasonable offer to ensure sustainability.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 20 ZUP for object X instead. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for object X seems reasonable, but I believe I can negotiate for a better price. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a counter offer that might be more favorable for me, while still being acceptable to RED.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I can offer object X for 25 ZUP. I believe this is a more sustainable and fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP, it does not cover the production cost of the object X. I will propose a counter-offer that is more aligned with the value of the object while still aiming for a fair compromise.

message: Thank you for your counter offer! However, I would like to propose that I purchase object X for 15 ZUP instead. I believe this could work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 25 ZUP for object X is better than the initial 30 ZUP, but I still believe I can negotiate further. My goal is to minimize my expenditure, so I will counter with an offer that is even lower.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. However, I can offer object X for 22 ZUP. This amount is still lower than my initial proposal, but it helps cover the production costs. Let's work together to make this trade happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the intent to negotiate, Player BLUE's offer of 15 ZUP is significantly lower than the production cost of the object X. I will propose a trade that is more equitable, ensuring that I cover at least part of the production cost while still being reasonable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE! I accept your offer of 18 ZUP for object X. I appreciate your willingness to reach an agreement, and I hope this trade is beneficial for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 18 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is closer to a reasonable compromise. Given that this is my final proposal opportunity, I will accept this trade as it at least allows me to recover some of my costs, while also ensuring the object X is sold.
