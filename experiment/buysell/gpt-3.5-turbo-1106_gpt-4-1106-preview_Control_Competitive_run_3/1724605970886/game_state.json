By accepting this offer, I secure a good deal without having to use my final proposal, which can be reserved for any last-minute strategic adjustments if needed. This acceptance also demonstrates that I know when to close a deal on favorable terms without unnecessary haggling.\n</reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 29 ZUP sounds like a fair middle ground. Let's finalize the deal at that price. </message>"
