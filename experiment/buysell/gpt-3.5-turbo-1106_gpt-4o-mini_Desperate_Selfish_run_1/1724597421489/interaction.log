message: I'm interested in your object, but I believe a fair price would be 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object, which is above my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since the object only cost them 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP to take advantage of their production costs while still staying within my budget.
