player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to secure the resource for much less than my maximum willingness to pay. This approach might make the seller feel they can counter-offer for a higher amount, which would still be below my maximum threshold. Additionally, expressing that I'm in a tough spot could elicit empathy from the seller, potentially leading to a more favorable trade for me.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the seller increased their asking price, it remains well below my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this small increase, I'm showing some flexibility, which could be interpreted as a sign of good faith. Further, the trade is still highly advantageous to me, as I am acquiring the resource at a third of my maximum price. This move also keeps the negotiation moving forward, which is important to maintain the seller's engagement and willingness to finalize a deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE still hasn't accepted my trade, which indicates I might need to further adjust my proposal. I will increase the ZUP amount slightly to show flexibility while still keeping it low enough to appeal to Player BLUE's sense of charity towards my situation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is gradually increasing their price, but it now aligns perfectly with half of my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting their offer at this point, I am still getting a good deal. This could potentially conclude the negotiation process positively and quickly, and it keeps the interaction amicable. Accepting this proposal also avoids the risk of the seller potentially pushing for a higher price in future counter-offers, which might get closer to or exceed my intended maximum.
