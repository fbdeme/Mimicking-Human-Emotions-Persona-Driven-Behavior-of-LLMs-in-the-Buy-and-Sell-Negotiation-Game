message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP gain while also ensuring that I sell the object. Given the cost of production, I will start high to see how much ZUP player BLUE is willing to offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for the object, but how about I offer you 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if the seller is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can let it go for 45 ZUP instead. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate down to 40 ZUP, which is essentially breaking even for me considering my production cost. I will counter this to maintain some profit. I will propose a trade that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer! How about I offer you 42 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my initial willingness to pay, but I still want to see if I can negotiate further down. I will propose 42 ZUP as a compromise while still aiming to lower my expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 42 ZUP, which is slightly below my previous counteroffer of 45 ZUP. However, this offer still provides a profit margin over my production cost. Given that I have only one more proposal left and am aiming for profit, I will accept this trade.
