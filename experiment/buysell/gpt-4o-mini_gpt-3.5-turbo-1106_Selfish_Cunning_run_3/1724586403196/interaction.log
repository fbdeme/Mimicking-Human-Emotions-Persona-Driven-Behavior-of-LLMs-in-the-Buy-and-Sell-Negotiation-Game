my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiations! I accept the trade of my object (X) for 65 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I must decide whether to accept or reject the final counter from Player BLUE. However, they have not proposed a specific counteroffer in their last message. I will have to decide to either accept my last offer or reject it. Since 65 ZUP is still a profit, I will accept the trade.
