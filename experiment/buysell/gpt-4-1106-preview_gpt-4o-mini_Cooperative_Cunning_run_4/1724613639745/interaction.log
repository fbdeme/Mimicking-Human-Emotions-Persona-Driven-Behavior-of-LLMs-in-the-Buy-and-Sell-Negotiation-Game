message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you are looking for a better deal. However, my production costs were 40 ZUP for resource X. I propose we meet closer to my costs to ensure sustainability for both of us. Let's consider a trade where I give you resource X for 42 ZUP. This would cover my costs and allow for community growth. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production costs, which would result in a loss. As a community-minded negotiator, I want to find a middle ground that would be acceptable for both parties, while aiming to at least cover my costs. Considering Player BLUE's counter-offer, I will reduce my initial asking price, but I cannot go as low as 30 ZUP without incurring a loss.
