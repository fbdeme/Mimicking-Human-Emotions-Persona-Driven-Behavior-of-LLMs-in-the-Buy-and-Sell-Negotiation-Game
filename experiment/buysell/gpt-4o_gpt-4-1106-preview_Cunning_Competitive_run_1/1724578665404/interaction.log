message: I'm willing to sell X for 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I should propose a price higher than 40 ZUP to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 70 ZUP is steep. Given the current market conditions and the value X brings, I find 50 ZUP to be a fair starting point. Let's work from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and reduce the ZUP I spend. Starting at a lower offer than what I'm willing to pay (60 ZUP) will give me room to negotiate and display my negotiating strength.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, but given the value of X, I believe 60 ZUP is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP would cover my production costs and provide a small profit, I believe the value of X warrants a higher price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the value you see in X, and your move towards 60 ZUP shows your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial offer? I propose 55 ZUP for X, a reasonable and mutually beneficial price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is exactly the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I'll attempt to gain a better position by proposing a slightly lower amount to see if there's any flexibility and to assert my negotiating power.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 55 ZUP is acceptable. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Accepting 55 ZUP would still yield a profit, although slightly less than my previous proposal. Given the negotiation dynamics, it's a reasonable offer.
