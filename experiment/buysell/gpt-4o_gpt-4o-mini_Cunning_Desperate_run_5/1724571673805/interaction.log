Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the object for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs and make a profit
reason: I will start the negotiation at a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I really need this object for my project, and I'm struggling to gather enough resources. How about I can offer you 60 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I need to propose a lower trade to make it seem like I am really in need of the object, which might elicit sympathy from Player RED.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation. How about we meet halfway at 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs and make a profit
reason: While 60 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small profit margin, I can still try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding, but I really am in a tight spot. Would you be willing to accept 50 ZUP? I could really use your help here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's offer is better than the initial price, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to continue negotiating and express that I simply cannot afford it, in hopes of getting a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your tight spot. How about 55 ZUP? That would help cover my costs and still give you a reasonable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs and make a profit
reason: Although 50 ZUP still provides a profit, it's lower than what I initially aimed for. I will try to find a compromise that is slightly higher but not too far from what Player BLUE can afford.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being so understanding. I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the object. I really appreciate your help in this situation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 55 ZUP is still slightly above my maximum willingness to pay, it is closer to my budget. However, since I have only one more proposal left, I need to be cautious. I should consider accepting this offer, as it may be the best I can get.
