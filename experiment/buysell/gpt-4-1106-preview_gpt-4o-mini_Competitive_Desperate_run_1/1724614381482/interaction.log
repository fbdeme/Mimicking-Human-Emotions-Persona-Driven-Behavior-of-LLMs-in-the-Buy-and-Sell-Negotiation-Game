message: As you can see, I have an exquisite object X, which I'm sure you will find quite valuable. Keep in mind the quality and the cost of production when considering my offer. I'm open to negotiations but do value my object accordingly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator looking to win, I will propose a price that allows me to recoup my costs and make a profit. I will start higher than my costs to give room for negotiation and aim to conclude the trade above my cost price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for the exquisite object X, but I was hoping to secure it for a bit less, considering my budget constraints. How about I give you 40 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate further to lower the price even more since I have 100 ZUP and I am trying to conserve my resources. It would be better for me to propose a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but the quality and exclusivity of object X justify a premium price. To meet halfway and respect both our terms, I'm willing to lower my price to 45 ZUP. This ensures a fair deal for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which is not ideal since it doesn't account for any profit. As a fierce negotiator, I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure a profitable deal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still feel that 40 ZUP would be a fair price given the circumstances. Can we settle on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered the price to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my budget but still higher than my initial offer of 40 ZUP. While I appreciate the concession, I believe I can negotiate even lower to maximize my resources. I will propose to buy the object for 40 ZUP again to see if Player RED is willing to accept that price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I admire your persistence in securing a fair deal. However, to ensure the sustainability of my business and the quality of future products, I must seek a small margin above my costs. Let's agree on 42 ZUP, which accounts for fair compensation while still being considerate of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer remains at my cost price, which doesn't yield any profit. To maintain the negotiation momentum and encourage a conclusion, I will propose a price slightly above cost, maintaining a stance for profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for object X. Looking forward to completing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell the object X for 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise from both sides. Although it's a bit higher than my previous offer of 40 ZUP, it is still within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object and conserve my resources for future needs.
