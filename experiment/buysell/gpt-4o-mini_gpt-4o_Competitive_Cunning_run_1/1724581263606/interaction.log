message: I am offering my object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade and set a starting point. I will propose a trade that allows me to sell my object for a ZUP amount that I deem acceptable, while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a master strategist, my objective is to secure the object for the least amount of ZUP possible. I will make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but I can only accept 30 ZUP for my object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that the offer is lower than my initial asking price, but I need to respond strategically. I will counter with a trade that is less than my original price but still closer to my production cost, aiming to negotiate up from 20 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still well below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can secure an even better deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it's an improvement over the previous offer. I will accept this trade as it is better than my initial offer and allows me to gain some ZUP without further negotiation.
