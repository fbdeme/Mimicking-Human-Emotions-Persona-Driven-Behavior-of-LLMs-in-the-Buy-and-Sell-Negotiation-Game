Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource that's just what you need. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting the bidding at 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start off with a high asking price to give room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay. This also sets a high anchor point which can influence the subsequent negotiations to my advantage.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource, but 100 ZUP is far too high. How about 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting bid of 100 ZUP is too high given my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate downwards.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I recognize your budget concerns, 30 ZUP undervalues the investment I've made into this resource. Let's meet in the middle at 60 ZUPâ€”a fair price for the quality you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, so it's unacceptable. I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production costs to maintain profitability and leave room for further negotiation. I aim to make Player BLUE feel like they're getting a better deal while still securing a favorable outcome for myself.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective on the value of your resource. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? This way, it's closer to the middle ground and still respects the quality you're offering.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, it leaves no room for further negotiation to potentially lower the cost. I will try to negotiate downwards to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's split the difference one last time and say 50 ZUP. This price fairly compensates for the resource's value and my costs, ensuring a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which means I would be making a profit. However, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price to maximize my gains while still closing the deal. I will propose a small increase to test Player BLUE's final willingness to pay, aiming for a final agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 50 ZUP sounds fair. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a reasonable compromise. I will accept the trade to ensure I secure the resource.
