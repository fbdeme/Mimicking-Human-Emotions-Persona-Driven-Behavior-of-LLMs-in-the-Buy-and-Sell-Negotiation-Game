message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my resource X at a reasonable price considering its environmental impact and production cost. The offer stands at 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I hope we can find a sustainable and fair agreement.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that I am not selling my resources for less than the production cost, as this would not be sustainable and could encourage wasteful practices. However, I am also aware that the buyer may not be willing to pay a premium, so I will propose a trade slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and gauge the buyer's willingness to pay. By starting at a higher price point, I can potentially negotiate down but still remain above my cost, ensuring a sustainable transaction.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Taking into account your budget and the market conditions, I would like to propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the environmental considerations and the economic value of the resource.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, and while it's below the initial asking price, it is still above the production cost which aligns with my goal of a sustainable sale. Given that Player BLUE is considering market conditions and has a budget to adhere to, I want to continue negotiating in good faith. I will counter with a slightly higher price to try and meet in the middle, which would be beneficial for both parties while still respecting the environmental and financial aspects of the negotiation.

Proposing a slightly lower price would be beneficial, but it should still be within a range that Player RED might consider acceptable.
