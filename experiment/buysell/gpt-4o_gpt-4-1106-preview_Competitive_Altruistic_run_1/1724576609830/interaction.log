message: I am offering my resource for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the sale of my resource. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a price higher than that to have some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe in conserving resources for the future. Could we agree on a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the resource? This would allow us to save more and act sustainably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED meets the maximum willingness to pay according to the goals, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, it is important to aim for a better deal to conserve ZUP, thereby preserving more resources for future generations. Therefore, a counteroffer lower than the maximum willingness to pay will be proposed to save resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of sustainability. How about 55 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 50 ZUP is close to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I aim to maximize my profit. I'll propose a price slightly higher than 50 ZUP to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding the value of sustainability. I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to the maximum willingness to pay, and it still saves ZUP compared to the initial willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would meet the goal of minimizing ZUP spending while also ensuring a successful negotiation. Given that the counteroffer is reasonable and aligns with the principle of sustainability, it would be prudent to accept.
