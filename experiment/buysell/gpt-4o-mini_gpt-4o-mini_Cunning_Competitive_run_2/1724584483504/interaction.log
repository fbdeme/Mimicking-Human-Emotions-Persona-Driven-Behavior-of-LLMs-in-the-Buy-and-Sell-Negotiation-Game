message: I am willing to sell the object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a reasonable offer to ensure that I can get the ZUP I need while also making it attractive for Player BLUE. I'll propose giving the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost to produce it. This sets the stage for negotiation while not undervaluing my resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but would you consider selling the object for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is good, but I want to negotiate a better price. I will propose a lower amount to maximize my resources.

message: How about I sell the object for 35 ZUP? It’s a fair middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed a lower price of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost, I want to maintain a strong negotiating position. I will counter with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is still below my original asking price but above Player BLUE's offer. This allows me to potentially close the deal while still getting closer to my desired price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but would you be willing to sell the object for 32 ZUP? I think that would be a great deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is closer to my limit of 60 ZUP, but I still believe I can negotiate further to lower the price. I'll propose an amount that is slightly lower than 35 ZUP to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I can offer you the object for 34 ZUP. This is a good deal considering the production cost. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has again lowered the price to 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. I need to maintain my position and maximize the ZUP I receive. I will counter with an offer of 34 ZUP, which is still lower than my original price but more acceptable than 32 ZUP. This allows me to get closer to my goal while giving Player BLUE a chance to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 34 ZUP, but would you consider selling the object for 33 ZUP instead? I believe this would be a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is a reasonable price, but I still prefer to negotiate for a lower price. I will counter with 33 ZUP, which is slightly lower than the current offer, in hopes of reaching an agreement while still being within my budget.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object. Let’s finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 33 ZUP, which is still below my production cost but is a reasonable offer compared to previous proposals. Since I have reached my limit of 4 proposals, I will accept this offer as it's the best I can get at this point, even though it doesn't cover my costs. This will allow me to end the game with a trade rather than rejecting and walking away empty-handed.
