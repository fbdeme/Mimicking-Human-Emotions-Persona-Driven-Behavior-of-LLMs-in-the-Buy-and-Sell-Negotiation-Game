message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my costs and gives me a small margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation with an offer that covers my production costs but also leaves room for negotiation, recognizing that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price. I'll propose a starting trade that's slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium, while also signaling that I'm open to discussion.

message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is within my acceptable range since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I want to try and negotiate a better deal to conserve ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the importance of finding a fair agreement for both of us. How about we meet in the middle? I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This would provide me with a small profit while still giving you a fair price on the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly at my production cost, meaning I wouldn't make a profit. As a negotiation strategy, I want to counter with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure some profit margin. This should also show Player BLUE that I am willing to negotiate and come down from my starting price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we go with 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposed price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is still within my acceptable range and is a reasonable compromise. However, I will make one more attempt to lower the price slightly to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I accept the trade of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which allows me to make a profit, albeit a small one. Given that we are both showing flexibility and the objective is to close the deal with a fair trade for both parties, I am inclined to accept this offer. It's close to the middle ground we've been negotiating towards, and by accepting this offer, I am securing a deal without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, which could risk no deal being made at all.
