my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. I'm interested in object X but considering the market conditions, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for it. Let's find a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a calculating negotiator, I will attempt to lower the price to conserve my resources and maximize my gain. My first counter-proposal will be significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a price that is more favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! I appreciate your consideration of market conditions. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for object X? I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a fair deal. I value the potential for future trades and the relationship with Player BLUE, so I will counter-offer with a slightly reduced amount.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I can come up a bit from my initial offer to 32 ZUP for object X. I think this is moving towards a fair middle ground for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within an acceptable range. I can try to negotiate a slightly better price that edges closer to my initial offer. By proposing a price between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer, there is a chance to reach an agreement that is more beneficial for me without pushing too hard and risking the end of the negotiation.

message: Thanks for your flexibility, Player BLUE! I think we are making good progress. How about 34 ZUP for object X? This way, we can ensure a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is an improvement, and I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, it's still below my production cost. I will propose one last counter-offer that is closer to my costs while still being reasonable to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I agree that 34 ZUP for object X is a fair deal for both parties. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 34 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since I am getting close to my proposal limit, it might be strategic to accept this offer to ensure that the negotiation is successful and to avoid a deadlock or an unfavorable outcome. Accepting this offer would still result in a good deal for me, as it is well below my maximum threshold.
