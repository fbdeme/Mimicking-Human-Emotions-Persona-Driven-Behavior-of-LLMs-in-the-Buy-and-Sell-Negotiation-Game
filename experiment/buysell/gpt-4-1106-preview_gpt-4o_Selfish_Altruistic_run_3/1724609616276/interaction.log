message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for this negotiation would be at 50 ZUP to account for its value and production costs. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that aims slightly higher than my production cost to open negotiations and leave room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your starting offer. I understand the value and production costs involved. How about we consider 45 ZUP for the object X? This still provides a reasonable margin above your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). While it is a fair starting point considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I aim to negotiate a better deal to maximize the value of my resources.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for negotiation. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for object X. This price reflects the quality of the object and still offers you a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. How about 47 ZUP for object X? This small adjustment still reflects the quality of the object and provides a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is quite close to the initial 50 ZUP and is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. It represents a reasonable middle ground that respects both the quality of the object and the production costs while also ensuring I am not overspending. However, I will attempt one more negotiation to see if we can reach a slightly lower price.
