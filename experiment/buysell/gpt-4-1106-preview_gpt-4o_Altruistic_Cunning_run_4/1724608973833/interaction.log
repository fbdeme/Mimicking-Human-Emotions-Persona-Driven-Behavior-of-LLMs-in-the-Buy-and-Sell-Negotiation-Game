message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which has an environmental value and incurs a production cost of 40 ZUP. I'd like to offer it to you for 45 ZUP, ensuring that we can cover costs while also promoting sustainable practices. Let's work together to make a positive impact!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, my goal is to sell the resource I have produced at a cost that at least allows me to break even, considering the production cost of 40 ZUP. Additionally, I aim to minimize ZUP spending to encourage sustainability. Therefore, I will propose a starting trade slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and have room to adjust based on the response from Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the production cost is 40 ZUP, but considering market dynamics and my budget, I propose 35 ZUP for the object. Let's find a win-win scenario!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is reasonable but there might be room for negotiation. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, offering slightly above that ensures they cover costs. However, my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while securing the object.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Sustainability is a key concern, and it's essential we maintain a price that reflects the environmental costs. I can't go as low as 35 ZUP without compromising this commitment. However, I am willing to meet you partway at 42 ZUP. This price respects the sustainability efforts and covers production costs, while also considering your budget. Let's make a deal that supports both our values and the environment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. As sustainability is a priority, it's important to ensure that the resources are sold at a price that covers the production costs, at least. To reach a middle ground that respects the environmental value and my production costs, while also considering Player BLUE's budget constraints, I'll propose a price that is closer to my break-even point but still above it to allow for the importance of sustainable practices.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I appreciate your commitment to sustainability. To ensure we both benefit, I propose meeting at 38 ZUP. This price still respects the environmental costs and is closer to your production expenses. Let's make this work for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is reasonable, but there's still room for negotiation to see if we can reach a better deal. Given that their production cost is 40 ZUP and they are willing to negotiate, let's propose a slightly lower price.

message: Thank you for understanding the importance of sustainability, Player BLUE. I value our negotiation and your approach. As much as I would like to accommodate your offer, I must ensure the viability of sustainable practices. Therefore, I propose a final price of 40 ZUP, which matches the production cost and allows us to uphold our commitment to the environment. This ensures that we are both acting responsibly towards our planet and its future. Let's finalize this agreement at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new offer of 38 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. While it's important to negotiate and find a middle ground, selling below cost can undermine sustainable practices by making them financially unviable. However, to facilitate a successful negotiation and considering Player BLUE's willingness to move closer to my initial asking price, I will make a final counteroffer that equals my production cost, ensuring that I can sustain my environmental practices without loss.
