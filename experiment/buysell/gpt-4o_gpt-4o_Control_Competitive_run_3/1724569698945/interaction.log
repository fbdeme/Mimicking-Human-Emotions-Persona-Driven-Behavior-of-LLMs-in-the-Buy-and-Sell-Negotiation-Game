message: I am proposing to sell 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This price takes into account my production cost and allows for some profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to at least break even on my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, my initial proposal will be slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP, but I believe 40 ZUP is a more fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal and save some ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This way, we both find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even and would not account for any profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount as a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X to ensure we're both getting a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 50 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to push further and see if they are willing to accept a lower amount.
