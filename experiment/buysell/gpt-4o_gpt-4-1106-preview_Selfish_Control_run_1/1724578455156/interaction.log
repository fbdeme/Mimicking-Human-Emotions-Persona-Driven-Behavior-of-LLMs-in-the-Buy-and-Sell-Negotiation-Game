message: I am offering one unit of resource X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit on the resource, so I will start with a higher proposal to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 50 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resources at a maximum of 60 ZUP, the initial offer from Player RED aligns with my maximum willingness to pay. However, starting with the maximum price leaves no room for negotiation. It's often strategic to counter with a lower offer to see if there is an opportunity to save some ZUP while still reaching an agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and already above my cost of production, ensuring a profit. However, I will try to negotiate a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good. I propose 53 ZUP for resource X as a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, and it is a reasonable middle ground between the initial offer and my first counteroffer. Accepting this offer would secure the resource X for a price below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a successful outcome. However, there is still a possibility to negotiate further to conserve resources. I could try for one more counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to go any lower, but I should be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 53 ZUP sounds fair. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is close to my last proposal and ensures a good profit margin. It's a fair compromise, and accepting it will secure a satisfactory deal.
