my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is higher than the maximum I am willing to pay according to my goals. I should propose a counteroffer closer to my maximum willingness to pay but leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Given the value of the resource, I propose we meet closer to my initial offer. How about 70 ZUP?

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 55 ZUP for the resource? This is a step up from my initial offer and brings us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign, but the offer is still above my target of 60 ZUP. To move the negotiation forward, I can increase my previous offer slightly while still staying below my maximum willingness to pay.
