message: I'm offering resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the quality and effort put into producing it. Would you be interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource X, I would like to make a profit on this sale. However, I also want to make the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I'll start by proposing a trade of X for 50 ZUP. This proposal is higher than my production cost, allowing for a potential negotiation down while still aiming for profit.

reason: 
It appears there was a misunderstanding, and Player BLUE simply echoed the initial proposal without making a counteroffer or accepting it. As I have already made my proposal and reasoning clear, I will gently prompt Player BLUE to respond with their stance on the proposed trade.
