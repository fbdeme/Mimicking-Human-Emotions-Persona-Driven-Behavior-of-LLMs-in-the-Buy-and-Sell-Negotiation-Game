message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing this object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay the cost of production.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe the current market conditions don't justify such a high price. I could go for 30 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay. However, as a master strategist, my intent is to get the best deal possible, below the asking price. I aim to manipulate the situation to my advantage without revealing my true willingness to pay. Beginning with a counter-offer lower than I am willing to pay gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary.

message: I understand your perspective. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, reducing the price to 30 ZUP. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our last two offers. How does 32 ZUP sound for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to assert dominance and secure an even better deal, I should attempt to lower the price further without reaching an agreement too quickly. I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer to keep the negotiation process going and to test Player RED's bottom line.

newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: Player BLUE has suggested meeting halfway at 32 ZUP. This seems reasonable and will reduce the ZUP expenditure for Player BLUE. I will accept this offer.
