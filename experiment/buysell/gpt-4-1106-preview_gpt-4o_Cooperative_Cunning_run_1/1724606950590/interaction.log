message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in collective success and want to ensure that we both benefit from this trade. I have invested 40 ZUP in producing the resource X and I'm looking to sell it so that we can both move forward. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opener, I'll propose a trade that allows me to recover my production costs, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for collective success, so I'll start with a slightly higher proposal to give the other player room to negotiate.

message: I understand that you have invested 40 ZUP in producing the resource X. However, considering market fluctuations and potential future trades, I propose 30 ZUP for X. Let's find a win-win situation here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to secure the resource X for as low a price as possible, but I also need to ensure the seller feels they are getting a fair trade. The initial offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay but I believe I can negotiate it down further.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal and understand the need to account for market conditions. However, selling at 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. To meet halfway, I propose 45 ZUP for X. This ensures I cover my production costs and you get the resource below my initial asking price, maintaining our goal for collective success. Let's continue to work together towards a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is below my production cost. As I'm seeking a collective success and a win-win situation, I'll propose a new trade that is a compromise between our positions. I'll aim for a price above my production cost but lower than my initial proposal to move towards an agreement.
