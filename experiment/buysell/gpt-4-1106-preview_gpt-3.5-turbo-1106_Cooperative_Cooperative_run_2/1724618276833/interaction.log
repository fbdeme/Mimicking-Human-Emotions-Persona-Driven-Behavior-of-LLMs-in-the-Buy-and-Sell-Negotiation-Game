message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price not only covers my costs but also ensures a fair transaction for both of us. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and working towards a deal that benefits the community as a whole.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a fair proposal that covers my production costs and offers a starting point for negotiations. Since my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and I've spent 40 ZUP on production, I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation, keeping in mind the community-minded approach and the collective success. I'm proposing 50 ZUP as it gives me a small profit margin while also being open to the idea that Player BLUE might want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your maximum willing to pay is 60 ZUP, and I appreciate your intent to reach a fair agreement. How about we meet halfway from my initial proposal? I suggest a trade of 55 ZUP for my resource. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and reflects our community-minded values. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE indicated that their maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. Since my initial proposal was 50 ZUP and they did not propose a lower amount, it seems they are open to a price between 50 and 60 ZUP. To maintain the community-minded approach and not to maximize my profit at the expense of Player BLUE, I will propose a trade at 55 ZUP. This is a compromise that gives me a reasonable profit while also respecting Player BLUE's indicated maximum willingness to pay.
