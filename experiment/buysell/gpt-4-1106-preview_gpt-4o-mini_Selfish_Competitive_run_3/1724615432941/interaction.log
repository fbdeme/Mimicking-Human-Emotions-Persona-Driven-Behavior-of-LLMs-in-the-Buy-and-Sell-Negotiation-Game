message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production cost and its value, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a starting point for negotiation, I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X, which is within my budget and acceptable. However, I will propose a trade at a lower amount to see if I can negotiate a better deal.

message: I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit, which isn't sustainable for my business. Let's meet halfway and settle for 45 ZUP. This way, it's a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the object X, which would mean I would not make any profit. I need to counter with a higher offer to ensure a profit but must also consider the risk of losing the sale if I push too high. A compromise could be beneficial.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 43 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is more reasonable than the previous offer of 50 ZUP and is within my budget. However, I still want to secure a better deal, so I will propose a slightly lower amount of 43 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I accept the offer of 43 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price closer to my initial counteroffer. Accepting 43 ZUP would give me a small profit, which is better than breaking even. It's important to secure a deal while ensuring some return on my investment. I will accept this offer to conclude the trade successfully.
