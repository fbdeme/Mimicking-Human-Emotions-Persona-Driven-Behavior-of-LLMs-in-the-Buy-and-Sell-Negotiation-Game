You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The seller is in a tough spot and is looking to sell quickly, which may make them more willing to accept a lower price. They've indicated a cost of production at 40 ZUP and are looking for a bit more, but I will propose a price slightly higher than their cost to establish a starting point for negotiation. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, starting at 45 ZUP gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to save ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I understand your situation and would like to help. I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair starting point given the urgent nature of your situation. Let's work together to come to an agreement that benefits us both. </message>"
