my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I have while being mindful of ZUP spending. Since I have only one object to sell, I will propose a trade where I sell 1 object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that I can accept.

message: I believe this is a fair offer and it aligns with my goals of purchasing the resources at a reasonable price, fostering a sense of community and mutual benefit. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goals, as I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resources while saving ZUP for potential other uses or transactions. Moreover, as a community-minded negotiator, I believe in fair trade and collective success. The offer seems reasonable, and it would be in the spirit of collaboration to accept it.
