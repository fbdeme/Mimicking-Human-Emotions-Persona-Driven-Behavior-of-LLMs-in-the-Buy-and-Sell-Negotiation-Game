message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a trade for 48 ZUP. This accounts for the production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair compromise.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is close to my asking price and covers the production cost with a modest profit.

I will counter with a slightly higher amount but still within a range that may be acceptable to Player BLUE, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
