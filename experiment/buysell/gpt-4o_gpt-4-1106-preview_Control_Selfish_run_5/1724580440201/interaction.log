message: I am proposing to sell X for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and allows for a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to at least cover my production costs of 40 ZUP to avoid a loss. Ideally, I want to make some profit beyond this. I will start by proposing a reasonable price that ensures I cover my costs and make a modest profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit margin, but would you consider a price of 50 ZUP for the resource? It still gives you a profit over production costs, and it might be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum price I am willing to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I see an opportunity to propose a lower price to save some resources and get a better deal. I will propose a price below the asking price but still within a reasonable range, given that Player RED's production cost is 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both get closer to our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP does provide a profit over the production cost, I am aiming for a slightly higher profit margin. I will counter-propose a middle ground that benefits both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair, but I'd like to propose 53 ZUP. It's a bit closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willing price. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to achieve a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount than their counteroffer to reach an agreement that is more favorable for me while still giving Player RED a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to 53 ZUP. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 53 ZUP is close to the 55 ZUP I proposed and still provides a decent profit margin over my production cost. This seems like a fair and reasonable compromise.
