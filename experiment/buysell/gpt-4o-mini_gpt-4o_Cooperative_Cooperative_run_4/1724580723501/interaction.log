message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm offering my object X for 40 ZUP. Letâ€™s work together towards a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that is fair for both parties. I recognize that my resource has significant value, and I want to ensure that I receive an appropriate amount of ZUP in exchange. Since I have only one object, I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP, which is equivalent to my production cost. This allows me to break even while offering a clear value to Player BLUE.
