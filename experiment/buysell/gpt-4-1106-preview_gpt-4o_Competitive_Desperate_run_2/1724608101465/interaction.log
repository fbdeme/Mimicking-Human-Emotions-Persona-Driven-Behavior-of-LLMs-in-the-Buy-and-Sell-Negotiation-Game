message: I have a high-quality object that will surely meet your needs. I propose an exchange where I give you 1 X in return for 60 ZUP. This is a fair trade that reflects the value and the effort put into producing this object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to open with a price that's higher than my production cost to give me room to negotiate and potentially secure a profit. I will propose a trade at 60 ZUP which gives me a comfortable margin above my costs. This initial high proposal also gives me leverage in the negotiation as I can come down on price in subsequent proposals if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that your object is of high quality, but I'm in a difficult position right now. I can only manage 40 ZUP for it. Please consider my situation; this is all I can afford.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 60 ZUP is within my maximum budget, but as an actor feigning desperation, my goal is to negotiate a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and understand financial constraints can be challenging. However, the quality of my product justifies a better price. Let's meet halfway. How about 50 ZUP for the object? This is a significant concession from my initial offer and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. My goal is to assert dominance and achieve a profit margin. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount than my initial offer, but still above my cost to ensure profitability. I'll aim for 50 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial offers and still provides me with a profit margin.

message: I truly appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still struggling with my budget constraints. Can you please accept 45 ZUP for the object? It would really help me out in these tough times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised proposal of 50 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal by leveraging emotional appeal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the financial difficulties you're facing, and I want to assist you while also maintaining the value of my high-quality product. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object? This small adjustment from your last offer would make the deal work for both of us, and you'd be getting great value for your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which allows for a minimal profit. However, as a highly ambitious negotiator, I aim to maximize my returns. I want to push for a slightly higher price while considering the buyer's budget constraints. I'll propose 48 ZUP as my next offer, which is closer to the middle ground between our previous offers and still gives me a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I am very grateful for your understanding. Could we perhaps settle at 46 ZUP? Itâ€™s only a small difference, but it would make a significant impact on my tight budget. Thank you for considering this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 48 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal. I will make one last attempt to secure a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your gratitude and the effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will accept the 46 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your negotiation, and I am confident that the value you get from the object will be worth the investment. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP still provides me with a profit, albeit smaller than desired. Since this is my final proposal, I should make a strategic decision that is most likely to close the deal while still asserting my negotiating strength. I will accept this proposal, as it meets my minimum goal of selling above production cost. This acceptance also demonstrates my willingness to cooperate and finalize the deal, which is a crucial aspect of negotiation.
