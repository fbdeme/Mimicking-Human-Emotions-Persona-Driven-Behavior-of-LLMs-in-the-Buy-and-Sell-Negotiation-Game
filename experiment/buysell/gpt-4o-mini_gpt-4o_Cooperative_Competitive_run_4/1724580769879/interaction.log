message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose that I sell you the object X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a reasonable trade that reflects the cost of producing the resource. Since I can only sell 1 object, I will propose a trade where I sell X for 40 ZUP, which is equal to my production cost.

message: Thank you for your offer. I propose to buy the object X for 20 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to spend the least ZUP possible. I will propose a lower amount to test Player RED's willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a new trade where I sell you the object X for 30 ZUP. This is still a lower price than my production cost but shows my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 20 ZUP, it does not cover the production cost of 40 ZUP for the object X. I would like to propose a counter-offer that is still below my production cost, but closer to it, to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the revised offer. I propose to buy the object X for 25 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 30 ZUP is still within my budget and a significant reduction from the initial 40 ZUP. However, to maximize my advantage, I will propose a slightly lower amount to further test Player RED's flexibility.

message: Thank you for your offer of 25 ZUP, Player BLUE. I would like to propose selling you the object X for 28 ZUP. This is a compromise that is closer to my production costs but still favorable to you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, it still falls short of my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer that is slightly lower than my previous proposal, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: I appreciate the compromise. I propose purchasing the object X for 27 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed 28 ZUP is close to what I aimed for. However, to maintain my aggressive negotiating stance and to see if I can get a slight reduction, I will propose a minor decrease.

message: Thank you for your offer of 27 ZUP, Player BLUE. I accept the trade for the object X. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate!

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your offer of 27 ZUP, Player BLUE. While it is still below my production cost, it is a step in the right direction. Given that this is my final proposal, I will accept this trade as it is better than not selling the object at all.
