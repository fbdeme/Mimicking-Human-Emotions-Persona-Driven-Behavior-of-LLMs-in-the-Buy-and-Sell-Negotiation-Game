message: I'm offering resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair price that covers my costs and rewards the effort put into producing it. Would you consider 50 ZUP a fair exchange?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I can cover my costs and make a profit. This initial proposal can help gauge Player BLUE's valuation of the resource X.
