my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, 50 ZUP is still very close to my production cost of 40 ZUP. Could you please consider 70 ZUP? This would help me cover my costs and make a small profit. I'm really in need of this deal to make ends meet.
