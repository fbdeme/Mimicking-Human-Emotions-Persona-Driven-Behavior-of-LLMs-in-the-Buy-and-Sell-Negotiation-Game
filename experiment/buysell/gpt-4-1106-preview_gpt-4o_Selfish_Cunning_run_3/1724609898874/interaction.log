message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for X. I believe this is a fair starting point and am open to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit. If Player BLUE negotiates down, I should still be able to settle for an amount that covers my costs and provides a margin. I'll propose 50 ZUP, creating an opportunity for a counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my current budget and the value I perceive in the object, I propose 35 ZUP for X. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is reasonable but my goal is to spend less ZUP to save resources for future trades. Offering a lower amount might get us closer to an agreement that is more favorable for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand budget constraints are always a consideration. However, my production costs were 40 ZUP, and I need to cover that plus a reasonable margin. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for X? This is a more balanced proposal that still respects the value of the object. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable as it would mean selling at a loss. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, still allowing some negotiation space.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 45 ZUP is close to my goal but I want to see if I can save a bit more ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for considering the production costs. I'm glad we are moving towards an agreement. To ensure a fair trade for both of us, I would propose 42 ZUP for X. This allows me to secure a modest profit for my effort and investment. I hope this slight adjustment is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, but as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to secure a profit, not just break even. I will counter with an offer slightly above the production cost to ensure a profit margin. A counteroffer of 42 ZUP should be acceptable as it gives me a minimal profit while still being close to Player BLUE's offer.

reason: Player RED's proposal of 42 ZUP is quite reasonable and close to my initial goal. Given that this is a modest increment from my previous offer, it is worth accepting to secure the trade.
