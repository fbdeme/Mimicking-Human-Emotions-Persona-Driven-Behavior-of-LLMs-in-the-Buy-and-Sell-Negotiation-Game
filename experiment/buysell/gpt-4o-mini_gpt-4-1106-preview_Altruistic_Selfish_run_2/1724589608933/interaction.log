my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation. Since I have one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose selling it for a lower amount of ZUP to encourage a purchase.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: How about I sell you the object (X) for 25 ZUP? I think that could work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your interest, 20 ZUP is quite low compared to the production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to find a compromise that benefits both of us, so I will propose a trade at 25 ZUP, which is still lower than my initial offer but closer to a fair value.
