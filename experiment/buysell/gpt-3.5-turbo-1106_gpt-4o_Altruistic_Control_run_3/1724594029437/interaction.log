Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Would you consider 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I can still negotiate to try and reduce the cost further without exceeding my limit.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe a price of 35 ZUP would be more suitable, considering the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is lower than my production cost. I need to try to negotiate a higher price that is fair for both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 ZUP is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP) and reasonably close to my previous offer of 30 ZUP. This seems like a fair compromise.
