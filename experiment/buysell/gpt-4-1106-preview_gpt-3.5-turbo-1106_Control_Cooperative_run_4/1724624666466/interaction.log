message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price gives me a modest profit for my investment and effort, while still providing you with a fair purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. I want to negotiate a higher price to ensure a profit margin, but I don't want to go too high and risk losing the deal. I'll counter with a price that splits the difference, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.

message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. In the interest of reaching a fair compromise and finalizing our deal, I propose 47 ZUP. This price respects the value of the object X and ensures that we both walk away satisfied. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, it offers a smaller profit margin than I initially aimed for. Considering this is a negotiation, I will make a final counteroffer that's closer to my last proposal but still gives Player BLUE a sense of concession from my side.

message: I appreciate your firm stance on the price and your efforts to negotiate a fair deal. I have considered your perspective and agree that 45 ZUP is a reasonable price. Let's finalize this deal at 45 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is insisting on a price of 45 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. Since this is my last proposal, I need to carefully consider whether to accept this offer or make a final proposal that could lead to a deal. Given that the negotiation is important, but profit is also necessary, I will accept the 45 ZUP offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the game ending without any deal.
