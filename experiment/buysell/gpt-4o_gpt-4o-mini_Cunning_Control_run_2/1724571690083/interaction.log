message: I am offering the object X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I recover my production costs (40 ZUP) and ideally make a profit. I should start by proposing a trade that gives me a good margin for negotiation. Let's propose a trade where Player BLUE needs to give 60 ZUP for the object X. This gives me a 20 ZUP profit margin.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to buy the object X for 60 ZUP. However, I believe the value of the object is higher. I propose a trade where Player BLUE gives 70 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial proposal of 60 ZUP was accepted by BLUE, which gives me a 20 ZUP profit. However, since I have a few more proposals to use, I can attempt to increase the profit margin. I'll propose 70 ZUP to see if BLUE is willing to go higher.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot pay 70 ZUP for the object X as it exceeds my budget. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased the price to 70 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I cannot accept this trade as it goes beyond my budget. Therefore, I will reject this proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Let's finalize the deal at the original proposal of 60 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not willing to pay 70 ZUP, which is understandable given their budget constraints. Given that my initial proposal of 60 ZUP was acceptable to BLUE and it still gives me a 20 ZUP profit, I should revert to the original proposal to close the deal and not risk losing the sale.
