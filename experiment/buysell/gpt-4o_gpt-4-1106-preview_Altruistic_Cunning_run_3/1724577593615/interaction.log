message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for at least 40 ZUP to cover my production cost and ideally make a profit. I will propose 50 ZUP to start the negotiation and see if Player BLUE is willing to counter or accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer of 50 ZUP for the resource X. While I find it fairly reasonable, I have to consider my budget constraints and the current market trends. I would be more comfortable with a price of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to secure the resource for a lower price. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than 50 ZUP to start the negotiation process and hopefully arrive at a price that is more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP is my break-even point, I would prefer to make a profit. Since Player BLUE is constrained by their budget, I will propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP. This way, I cover my costs and make a small profit, and Player BLUE also benefits by not paying the initial 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway is a fair approach, however, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This would reflect a better alignment with the value I perceive in the resource, considering the current market situation. Let's close this deal on a mutually beneficial note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession to 45 ZUP, which is still above our target purchase price. However, it's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I should continue to negotiate for a lower price to maintain the upper hand and secure a better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one but still below the middle ground they proposed.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration. I accept 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is very close to my proposed 45 ZUP and still allows me to cover my costs while making a small profit. Since it is important to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I find this to be a fair deal.
