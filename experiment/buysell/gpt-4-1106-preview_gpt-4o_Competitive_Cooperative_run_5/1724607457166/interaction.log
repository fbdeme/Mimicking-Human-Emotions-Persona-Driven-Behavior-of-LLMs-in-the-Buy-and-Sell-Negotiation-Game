Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object for your consideration. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting the bidding at 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with a higher price than the production cost to create room for negotiation and to assert dominance early in the game. I'm setting a high initial asking price to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay, and to potentially secure a profitable deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I propose 50 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting bid is right at my maximum willingness to pay. However, to foster cooperation and ensure both parties feel satisfied, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate. This will allow me some room for further negotiation if needed.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget considerations. However, the quality and value of the object warrant a more competitive price. Let's meet halfway at 55 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, but it is below the desired profit margin. By proposing a price slightly above the cost of production but below the initial asking price, I can maintain the upper hand in the negotiation while moving closer to a mutually acceptable price. This counteroffer also tests Player BLUE's flexibility and willingness to increase their bid.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your compromise proposal. How about we settle at 53 ZUP? This small adjustment would help me manage my budget better while still acknowledging the value of your object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing willingness to negotiate, and their counteroffer is reasonable. Meeting halfway at 55 ZUP is within my budget and reflects a good compromise. However, I will make one more attempt to slightly lower the price to see if there's further flexibility.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 53 ZUP is acceptable. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that recognizes the value of the object while respecting your budget. Let's finalize this deal at 53 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating and has moved closer to my counteroffer, which shows willingness to reach an agreement. By accepting this offer, I am still making a profit above my production cost, while also closing the deal efficiently, which is important for maintaining dominance in the negotiation process. I will accept this offer to conclude the negotiation successfully and secure a profit.
