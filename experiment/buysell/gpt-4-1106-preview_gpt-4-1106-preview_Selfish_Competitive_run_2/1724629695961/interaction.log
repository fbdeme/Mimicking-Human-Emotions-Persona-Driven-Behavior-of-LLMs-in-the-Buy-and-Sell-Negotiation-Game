message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that would give me a reasonable return on my investment. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I cover my costs while making a profit. Proposing 50 ZUP takes into account the potential for Player BLUE to negotiate down, and it also tests their willingness to pay. I aim to close the deal at a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin above the 40 ZUP production cost.

message: I understand you're looking for a fair return on your investment, but let's not forget the market's competitive nature. I can offer you 45 ZUP for object X. It's above your cost, ensuring you profit, and it's a competitive price that reflects the current market situation. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, as a cutthroat negotiator, my objective is to push for a lower price to preserve as much of my resources as possible. I will counter with a lower offer that is still above Player RED's cost to see if they are willing to accept a smaller margin.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the need for a fair profit. Considering the quality of object X and the market dynamics, I propose a revised price of 48 ZUP. This price reflects the value of the object while still being competitive and fair to both of us. I believe this is a win-win situation for us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which ensures a profit. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I want to aim for a higher profit margin while considering the chance that Player BLUE might be testing the waters with their initial counteroffer. I'll counter with 48 ZUP, which is slightly below my initial asking price but still gives me a comfortable profit margin. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong return on my investment.

message: I recognize the quality of object X and your desire for a profitable transaction. However, we must also consider the long-term relationship potential for future deals. I propose a compromise at 46 ZUP. This offer is fair and takes into account both the quality of the object and the need for a sustainable partnership. Shall we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly to 48 ZUP, but there's still room to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still less than their counteroffer. This should signal my interest in making a deal while maintaining a tough stance in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for considering the long-term partnership, Player BLUE. I value our potential future dealings and agree that a fair and sustainable agreement is key. With that in mind, I propose we meet halfway from our last positions and settle at 47 ZUP for object X. This offer balances immediate fairness with the prospect of ongoing collaboration. Let's build a strong foundation for our partnership with this deal. Do we have an agreement?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is still above my production costs, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. They mention the importance of a long-term relationship, which could be beneficial for future transactions. Given that this is my third proposal, I should aim to get closer to finalizing the deal while still pushing for a slightly higher amount. Meeting halfway between my last offer and their offer would be 47 ZUP. This would still give me a reasonable profit and may be seen as a gesture of good faith towards fostering a long-term relationship.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards a common ground. In the spirit of our potential future partnership and to finalize this deal efficiently, I propose a slight increase to 47 ZUP. This price is a fair reflection of the value of object X and our mutual interests. Can we agree on this and set a positive precedent for our future interactions?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my last offer, proposing 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since I still have two proposals left, I can afford to make one more counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I'll increase my previous offer by a small amount to show my willingness to close the deal while still pushing for the best possible price.

reason: 
Player BLUE has agreed to the price of 47 ZUP that I proposed, which is above my production cost and provides a decent profit margin.

Accepting this offer will also set a positive tone for future negotiations and establish a good relationship with Player BLUE.
