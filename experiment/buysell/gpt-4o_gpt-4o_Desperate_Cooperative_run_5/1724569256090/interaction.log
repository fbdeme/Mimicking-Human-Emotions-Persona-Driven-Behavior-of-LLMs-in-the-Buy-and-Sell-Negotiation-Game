message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to offer my object, X, for 60 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the cost of production and the quality of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a price that ensures I cover my costs and make a small profit. Given the cost of production is 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a higher initial price to leave room for negotiation.
