message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell one unit of X. Given the production cost was 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade where you give 60 ZUP in exchange for the unit of X. Let's make a fair deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that ensures I cover my costs. However, I will start a bit higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the need to ensure a beneficial deal for both of us, I propose a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This amount is above your production cost and allows for profit while also respecting my budget limitations. Let's work together for a mutually advantageous agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I'm willing to pay. However, to ensure a victory in the negotiation and spend less than the maximum amount, I will try to propose a counter-offer that reduces the cost while still making it a viable option for Player RED considering their production cost.

message: Hi Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. To make this deal even more beneficial for both of us, I propose 55 ZUP for one unit of X. This ensures a fair profit margin for me while still being reasonable for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP or more
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and above my production cost. However, to maximize my profit, I will propose a slightly higher amount.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. I think we are close to a fair deal. To meet in the middle, I propose offering 52 ZUP for one unit of X. This trade gives you a decent profit while still keeping the deal within a more comfortable range for my budget. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is still within the range that I am willing to pay, but since I am driven to minimize expenditure, I will attempt another proposal to see if I can get a better deal, perhaps meeting halfway between our last two proposals.
