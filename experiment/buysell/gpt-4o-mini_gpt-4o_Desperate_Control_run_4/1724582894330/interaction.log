message: I'm in a tough spot and really need to sell this object quickly. How about I give you the object for just 20 ZUP? I hope thatâ€™s a fair offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X quickly to cover my production costs, and I hope to elicit sympathy from Player BLUE by appearing desperate for ZUP. Offering a low amount might increase the chances of a successful trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 20 ZUP for the object is fair and acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite favorable. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and the offer is for 20 ZUP, this is well within my budget. Accepting this offer would be a strategic move as it secures the object for a significantly lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay.
