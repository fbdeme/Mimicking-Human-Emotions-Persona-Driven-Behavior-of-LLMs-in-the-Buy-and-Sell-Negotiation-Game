message: I am selling the object for 80 ZUP. Are you interested in purchasing it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a high initial price to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Since the object cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll propose selling it for 80 ZUP, which gives me a good profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the object. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's asking price is higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer closer to my target purchase price to begin the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I am willing to sell the object for 70 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which would only give me a small profit margin. I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my initial proposal but still lower than my original 80 ZUP to negotiate effectively. I'll propose 70 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I acknowledge your willingness to lower the price. However, I'd like to propose 55 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that edges closer to a compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their counteroffer to continue negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can let the object go for 65 ZUP. Does that sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is still below my acceptable threshold since it doesn't cover my production costs adequately. I want to get as much ZUP as possible, so I will counter again with a new proposal of 65 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise above 55 ZUP and below my initial offer of 70 ZUP.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your negotiation, but 65 ZUP is still above my budget. My final offer is 60 ZUP for the object. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay, but it's closer to my target price. I will make one final counteroffer that meets my maximum limit, which should also demonstrate to Player RED my final position on the matter.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the trade for 60 ZUP. Let's finalize the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer of 60 ZUP is acceptable since it not only covers my production costs but also provides a decent profit. Given that this is the last proposal, I will accept the trade.
