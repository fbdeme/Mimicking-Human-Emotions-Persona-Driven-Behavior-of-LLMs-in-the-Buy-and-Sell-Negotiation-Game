message: I really need to sell this object. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm barely scraping by. Please consider buying it for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object at a price higher than my production cost of 40 ZUP to make a profit. However, to start negotiations, I will propose a slightly higher amount to give me room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to buy the object for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that the seller's production cost is 40 ZUP and they are asking for 50 ZUP, it seems reasonable. This price is within my budget and would support Player RED while meeting my goal of not exceeding 60 ZUP.
