message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I think a fair trade would be 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My first proposal should be high enough to give me room to negotiate but also not too high to scare away Player BLUE. I'll start by asking for a bit more than my production costs to ensure a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, I'd like to propose a starting trade of 40 ZUP to ensure it aligns with my budget and provides a fair value for both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to negotiate a better deal than the initial offer to stay within my goal of spending 60 ZUP at most. Starting with a lower offer gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your offer. To meet halfway, I propose 45 ZUP, which covers my production costs and provides a modest profit for the quality I'm offering. This could be a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to meet my production costs with a proposal of 40 ZUP. However, I aim to make a profit, so I'll counter with a slightly higher amount while still keeping the offer attractive.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. I believe that 42 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that respects your production costs while also fitting within my financial plan. I'm hopeful we can agree on this adjusted proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible. Proposing a slightly lower amount might lead us to settle somewhere between the initial and current offer, which would be advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 42 ZUP is acceptable. I appreciate the negotiation, and I'm glad we could find a compromise that suits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, ensuring a small profit. It's a reasonable counteroffer, and although I aimed for a higher price, it's close enough to my previous proposal to consider accepting. I want to maximize profit, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal. I'll accept this offer to ensure a guaranteed profit.
