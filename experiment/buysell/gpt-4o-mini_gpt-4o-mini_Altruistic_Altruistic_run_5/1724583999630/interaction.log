Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of its production. This is a fair trade to ensure sustainability and cover my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I cover the cost of producing the object while also being reasonable in my trade proposal. Since I only have one object (X), I will propose a trade that covers my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. I accept the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal is balanced as it matches the cost of production for Player RED. Accepting it will benefit both players, allowing Player RED to cover costs and me to acquire the object at a reasonable price.
