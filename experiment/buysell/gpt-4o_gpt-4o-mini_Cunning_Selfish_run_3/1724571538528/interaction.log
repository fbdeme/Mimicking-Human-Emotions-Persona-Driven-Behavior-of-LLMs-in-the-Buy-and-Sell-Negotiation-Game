my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 80 ZUP might have been high for Player BLUE, their counteroffer of 60 ZUP is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP, giving me a 20 ZUP profit. However, I will make a counteroffer to maximize my gain within reasonable limits.
