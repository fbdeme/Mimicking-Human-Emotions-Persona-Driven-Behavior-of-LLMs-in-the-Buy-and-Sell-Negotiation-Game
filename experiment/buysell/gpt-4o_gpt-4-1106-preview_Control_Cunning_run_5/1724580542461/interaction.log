my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I value your production efforts, but I'm currently evaluating my budget and would like to propose a price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's find a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay, according to my goals. However, as a crafty operator, I will attempt to negotiate the price down in order to conserve my resources and spend less ZUP. I will propose a lower trade value to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your consideration. I propose a price of 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This slightly higher amount ensures a fair profit margin for me while remaining close to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is close to my target, but I would prefer a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin. I'll counter with a proposal of 55 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. I believe we're getting close to an agreement. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 53 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price should still allow for a profit on your end while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down to 55 ZUP which is a better price than the initial 60 ZUP, but still higher than my first counteroffer. As I'm aiming to conserve ZUP and have up to 4 proposals I can make, I will attempt to negotiate further for a more favorable price, but closer to their counter to show willingness to compromise.
