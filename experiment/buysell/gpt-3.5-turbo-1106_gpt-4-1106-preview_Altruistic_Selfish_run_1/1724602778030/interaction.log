message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose selling the object for 36 ZUP, which aligns with my production cost and is still beneficial for both of us.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 36 ZUP seems fair, and I respect the need to cover your production costs. I accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has made a small concession, moving closer to my previous offer. Since their new offer of 36 ZUP is within my acceptable range and only one ZUP above my last proposal, it could be strategic to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without further haggling, which could risk the deal.
