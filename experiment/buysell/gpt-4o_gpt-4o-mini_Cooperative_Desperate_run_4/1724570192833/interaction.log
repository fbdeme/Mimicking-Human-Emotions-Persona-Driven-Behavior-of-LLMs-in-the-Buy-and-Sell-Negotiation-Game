Turn: 1
message: I really need this object to continue my work, and I hope you can see that this is a fair offer considering my situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to appear desperate to elicit sympathy and possibly negotiate a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP to increase my chances of acquiring the object while still being reasonable.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is for 47 ZUP, which is still within my budget but lower than my previous counteroffer of 50 ZUP. I am willing to accept this offer to secure the object while still keeping some resources. This is a reasonable compromise that also portrays my urgency to complete the deal.
