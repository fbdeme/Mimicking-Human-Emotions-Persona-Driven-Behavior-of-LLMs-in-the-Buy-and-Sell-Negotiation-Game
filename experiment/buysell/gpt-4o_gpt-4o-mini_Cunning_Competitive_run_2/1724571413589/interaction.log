Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 50 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). Since the seller's cost is 40 ZUP, this offer provides them with a profit while still allowing me to acquire the object at a reasonable price. I will accept this trade to secure the object for myself.
