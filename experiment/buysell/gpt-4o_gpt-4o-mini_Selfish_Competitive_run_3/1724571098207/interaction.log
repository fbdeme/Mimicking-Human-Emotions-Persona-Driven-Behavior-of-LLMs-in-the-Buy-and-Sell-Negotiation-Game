Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only afford 60 ZUP for the resource. Would you consider this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 100 ZUP is too high for me, as I am only willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for the resource. I will propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I believe 80 ZUP would be a fairer price, considering the effort and cost involved in producing the resource. Would you agree to 80 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 60 ZUP is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I'll make a profit. However, I believe we can negotiate a bit further to increase my profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding, but I can only go up to 60 ZUP for the resource. That's my final offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is an improvement from the initial offer, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to stick to my budget, so I will propose a counteroffer again.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that the buyer is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP and it is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, accepting this offer would still result in a profit. It seems wise to secure this deal rather than risk losing the sale.
