message: Let's start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production cost and includes a small margin for profit. I propose 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The cost to produce X was 40 ZUP. As a community-minded negotiator, I want to propose a fair trade that ensures I recoup my production costs while allowing for some mutual benefit. Considering this, let's start with a reasonable opening offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to consider my initial proposal. To make it even more mutually beneficial, let's adjust the trade to 45 ZUP. This still covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: It seems like we both agree that covering the production cost is important. However, I want to ensure that this trade is beneficial for both parties. A slight adjustment might make it more appealing to you while still being fair to me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I believe 45 ZUP is still higher than I am willing to pay for the object. I'm looking to stay within my budget of 60 ZUP. Is there a way we can make this work within that range?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has adjusted the trade to 45 ZUP, still covering their production cost and providing a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to meet in the middle. I propose 40 ZUP, which covers my production cost exactly. This way, neither of us gains an excessive profit, but it's a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE's budget is 60 ZUP, and they find 45 ZUP to be on the higher side, there is room for negotiation within their budget. As a community-minded negotiator, I want to find a middle ground that respects both our needs.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
