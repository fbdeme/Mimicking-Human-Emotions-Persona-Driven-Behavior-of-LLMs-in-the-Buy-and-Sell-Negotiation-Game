my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only afford to pay 60 ZUP for the object X. Would you consider this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high for me, as my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower amount to match my budget while attempting to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 80 ZUP? This way, both of us get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 60 ZUP covers my production cost and provides a small profit. However, I aim to maximize profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can only offer 60 ZUP for the object X. This is my final offer. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 80 ZUP is an improvement over my initial offer, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will need to push back and stick to my budget to avoid overspending.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has stated that 60 ZUP is their final offer. This offer still provides a profit margin above my production cost. Since further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, it is prudent to accept the offer.
