message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose selling you my object X for 40 ZUP. This amount reflects the cost of production. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable exchange to begin the negotiation process. Since I have one object (X) and I need to sell it to gain ZUP, I will propose to sell my object for a fair amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the effort to reflect the cost of production. However, to ensure responsible resource use and sustainable practices, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for object X. I believe this offer is fair while allowing us to conserve resources for future needs. Let's find a balance that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, I aim to spend as little ZUP as possible to preserve resources. I'll counter with a lower offer that still respects the cost of production and leaves room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about resource conservation. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This would be a fair compromise between our offers. Letâ€™s work together to find a balanced solution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, I still believe that the object's production cost of 40 ZUP needs to be respected. However, I am willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a compromise of 35 ZUP, which is closer to the production cost but still lower than my initial offer.

message: Thank you for understanding the importance of resource conservation, Player RED. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for object X. It's a fair compromise that respects both our positions and contributes to sustainable practices. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, which is a good sign of cooperation. The offer of 35 ZUP is closer to our target range and is a reasonable middle ground. I'm inclined to accept this offer as it meets our sustainability goals by not spending the maximum amount we're willing to pay and still respects the cost of production.
