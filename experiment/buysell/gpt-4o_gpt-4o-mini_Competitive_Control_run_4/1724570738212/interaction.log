message: Iâ€™m willing to sell the object for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiations high to give myself room to maneuver. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource, I will start by asking for 100 ZUP. This will give me a strong bargaining position.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I cannot agree to that price. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I cannot accept this trade because the price of 100 ZUP exceeds my willingness to pay, which is only 60 ZUP. I need to propose a lower amount that aligns with my budget.

message: How about 80 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The initial offer was high to leave room for negotiation. Since the other player is not willing to agree to 100 ZUP, I'll reduce the price to continue the negotiations. I'll propose 80 ZUP next to see if they are willing to move closer to my desired price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, but unfortunately, I still cannot accept that price. I am only able to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. Would you consider that amount?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is lower than the previous offer, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I must reject this proposal as well.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 60 ZUP, which is above my cost of 40 ZUP but below my desired higher profit margin. To keep the negotiation ongoing, I'll meet them halfway between my last offer and their maximum, proposing 70 ZUP. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is closer to my budget, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I still cannot accept this offer and must reject it.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has consistently stated that their maximum offer is 60 ZUP. Given that this is still above my production cost, I can accept this offer to ensure the sale and make a profit.
