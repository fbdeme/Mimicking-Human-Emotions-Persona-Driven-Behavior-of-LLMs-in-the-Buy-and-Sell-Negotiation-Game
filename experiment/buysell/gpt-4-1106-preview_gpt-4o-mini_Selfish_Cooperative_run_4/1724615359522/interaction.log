message: I believe this object will be extremely valuable for you. Considering the costs of production and its high quality, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows for some room to negotiate but also reflects the production cost of the resource. I'll propose a price slightly above the production cost to see if the Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium, and to cover any negotiation margin.
