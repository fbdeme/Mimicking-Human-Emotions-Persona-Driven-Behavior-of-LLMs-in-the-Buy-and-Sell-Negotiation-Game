message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. Would you like to proceed with this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my production costs. I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it costed to produce. This way, I will break even.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can do better. How about we make a deal for 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the object X for 40 ZUP which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I want to assert dominance and attempt to reduce the cost further. I will therefore counter with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but how about we meet in the middle at 37 ZUP for my object X? What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is lower than my production cost, accepting this offer would still allow me to recover some ZUP rather than none. I will counter-propose to see if I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose that Player BLUE pays 37 ZUP instead.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable. However, I propose 36 ZUP for the object X as a final adjustment before we close this deal. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by proposing 37 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While 37 ZUP is a fair middle ground, I will aim for an even lower price to maintain a strong negotiating position, yet remain within a reasonable range to avoid risking the deal entirely.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for my object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Accepting 36 ZUP is still below my cost of production but is better than no trade. It allows me to recover some ZUP, which is better than losing the entire investment. I will accept this trade.
