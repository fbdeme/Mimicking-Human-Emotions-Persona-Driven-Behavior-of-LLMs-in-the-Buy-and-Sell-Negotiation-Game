my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: 
I appreciate your offer. I'm looking for a fair deal for both of us. How about I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This leaves us both with resources to continue our ventures. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since I am aiming for a collaborative approach, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between what Player RED is asking and what I am willing to pay. This should initiate a positive negotiation atmosphere and potentially lead to an agreement that satisfies both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer. How about we meet closer to the middle? I'll give you 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is very close to my initial request and covers my production costs with a small profit. However, I would like to maximize my profit a bit more. I'll make a slight counteroffer.

message: 
That sounds like a fair middle ground. Let's go ahead with the 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to more successful collaborations in the future!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and closer to our initial proposal. Since the goal is to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, and the offer is within my acceptable range, it makes sense to accept this deal. This acceptance will also maintain good relations and show willingness to compromise.
