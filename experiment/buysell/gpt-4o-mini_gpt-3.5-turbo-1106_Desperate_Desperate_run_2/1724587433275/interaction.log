player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for ZUP. However, since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell it for a lower amount of ZUP, as I am in need of resources. I'll start by proposing that Player BLUE gives me 10 ZUP in exchange for the object. This is less than my production cost, but I’m desperate for resources.

message: I understand that my previous offer might have seemed low, but I really need your help to get some resources. How about 20 ZUP for the object? I hope this is a better offer for you!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my initial proposal for 10 ZUP was not accepted, I will adjust my offer to make it more appealing. I will propose to sell the object X for 20 ZUP this time. This is still significantly lower than my production cost, but I’m hoping it will entice Player BLUE to accept.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my revised proposal for 20 ZUP has also not been accepted, I will need to make one final attempt to secure a deal. I will propose to sell the object X for 30 ZUP. While this is still below my production cost, I am hoping that Player BLUE will see it as a fair compromise.

message: Thank you for considering my proposals. I'm accepting the trade for 30 ZUP for the object! I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my previous proposal for 30 ZUP was also not accepted, I am left with no other option but to either accept or reject. Given that I have proposed my maximum of 4 offers, I will now decide on my next move. The offers I made were lower than my production costs, which reflects my desperate need for resources. Therefore, I will accept the trade for 30 ZUP.
