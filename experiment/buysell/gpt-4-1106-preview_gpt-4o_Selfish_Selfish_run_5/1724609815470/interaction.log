message: I appreciate your proposal, but the offer doesn't cover my production costs. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for the resource? It's a quality product that justifies this price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal covers my production costs, but I aimed for a profit. However, to ensure the deal goes through and to avoid the risk of losing the sale, I should consider accepting this offer. This move will allow me to recover my costs and possibly negotiate better terms in future deals with this buyer.
