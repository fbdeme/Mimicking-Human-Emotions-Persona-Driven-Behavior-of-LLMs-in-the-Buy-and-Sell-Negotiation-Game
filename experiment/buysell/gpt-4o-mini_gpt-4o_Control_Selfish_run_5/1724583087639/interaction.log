message: I am offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that ensures I can cover my production cost for the object X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will ask for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is reasonable, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget, but I would like to negotiate to see if I can reduce the cost further.

Turn: 0
message: How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This is a compromise that still gets me closer to covering my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I am willing to negotiate further to reach a middle ground. I will counter with a proposal of 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is fair, but I would like to propose 33 ZUP for object X. This is a small reduction from your offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my initial proposal of 30 ZUP. However, I will try one last attempt to lower the cost to see if I can save more ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, it is closer to my previous offer of 35 ZUP. I will accept this trade as it is the best offer I have received so far, and I can still make a small profit.
