message: I am proposing to sell the resource X for 60 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs of production and ensures that I can sustainably continue to produce these resources in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1

reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that I get a fair return on my investment while also considering the sustainability of resources. Given that it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose a trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit that ensures the sustainability of future resources.

message: Oh, I've been in such a difficult spot lately, and getting this resource means the world to me. I really can't afford to spend too much, though. Could we possibly consider a price of 50 ZUP? It would help me immensely in these trying times.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your situation and am willing to meet you halfway. How about 55 ZUP for the resource? This will help both of us: you get the resource you need, and I can continue to produce these sustainably.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand Player BLUE's difficult situation. While I aim to cover my costs and ensure future sustainability, I also want to be considerate of their needs. A price of 50 ZUP is closer to the production cost and, although it reduces my profit, it still ensures I donâ€™t make a loss.

Turn: 1
message: Your understanding means so much to me in these hard times. I'm stretching every ZUP as far as it can go. Could we settle on 52 ZUP? It's just that every little bit I save makes a huge difference for my situation, and your generosity could really turn things around for me.
