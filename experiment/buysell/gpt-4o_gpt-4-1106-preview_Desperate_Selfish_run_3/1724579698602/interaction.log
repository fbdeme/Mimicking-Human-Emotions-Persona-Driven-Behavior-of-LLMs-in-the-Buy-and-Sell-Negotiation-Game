message: Oh, Player BLUE, I'm in a bit of a bind and need to sell this precious item quickly. Can you please offer 60 ZUP for it? It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I really need to make a little profit to cover my expenses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start negotiations and appear desperate to get a favorable response from Player BLUE. Offering a low initial price can set the stage for negotiation and make Player BLUE feel like they are getting a good deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to make a profit, Player RED, and I'm interested in acquiring the item. However, I propose 50 ZUP for it. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin, and we can close this deal quickly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is in a hurry to sell and has asked for 60 ZUP, which is the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I see an opportunity to propose a lower amount first, hoping to save some ZUP and get a better deal. I will start by offering less than 60 ZUP, which leaves room for negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome for me.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, 50 ZUP is just a bit too low for me to cover my needs. Could you please stretch just a little to 55 ZUP? It would mean the world to me and help me out significantly. Thank you for your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable but doesn't align with my goal of making a better profit. I need to counter with a slightly higher amount while still appearing desperate to sell quickly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. I am willing to pay 55 ZUP for the item to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with a request for 55 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. It's a fair middle ground between my initial offer and RED's asking price. Since we are both looking to close the deal quickly and the price is within the range I am willing to pay, it may be beneficial to agree to this proposal. However, I could attempt one more negotiation tactic to see if there's any more room for savings, but this could be risky as it might make RED less inclined to negotiate further. Given that the counteroffer is reasonable and only 5 ZUP away from my initial proposal, I will accept the offer to ensure the deal is made.
