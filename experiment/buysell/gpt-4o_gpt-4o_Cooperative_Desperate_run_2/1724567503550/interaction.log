message: I understand your situation and appreciate your honesty. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing 45 ZUP for the resource X. This ensures I cover my production cost and make a small profit, and it keeps the deal feasible for you. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand Player BLUE's tight financial situation, accepting the proposed trade at 40 ZUP would result in no profit for me. To foster collective success, I will propose a compromise that slightly reduces my profit margin.
