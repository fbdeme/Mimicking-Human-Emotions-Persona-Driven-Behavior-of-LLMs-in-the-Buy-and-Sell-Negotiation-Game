my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the objective is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price above the production cost to ensure a profit. As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert dominance by starting with a high asking price, which can be negotiated down if necessary. This first proposal also sets the stage for the negotiation process.
