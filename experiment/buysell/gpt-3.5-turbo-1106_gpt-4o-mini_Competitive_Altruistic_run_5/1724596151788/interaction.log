Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of trading 1 X for 40 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is reasonable as it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I consider offering 40 ZUP for 1 X to be a fair trade, as it allows me to acquire the object while still conserving some of my resources.
