Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the resource X and believe that starting at 40 ZUP is a fair point for negotiation. I'm open to discussing terms that would be mutually beneficial. Let's work together to reach a deal that helps us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resource X and I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, starting with an initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my range. The offer also allows room for negotiation to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, keeping in mind my selfless negotiation strategy.

message: That's a very considerate offer, thank you! I believe that 38 ZUP for X is a fair price that benefits us both. I'm happy to accept this deal and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is even more favorable to me and is well within the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to conserve resources while also achieving my goal of buying X. Considering my selfless negotiation approach, this is a good deal for both parties as it ensures Player RED makes a sale while I obtain X for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
