message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the object, but I think we can start with a lower price. How about 15 ZUP for the object?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your interest! I understand your position, but I believe the fair price for the object is 25 ZUP. Let's see if we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 15 ZUP is too low considering the production cost. I will propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I would like to propose a middle ground. How does 22 ZUP sound for the object? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with a price of 25 ZUP. This is above my initial offer but still within my willingness to pay. I will make a counter-proposal to meet in the middle, which could be favorable for both sides.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I believe the object is worth 28 ZUP. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 22 ZUP is certainly closer to the fair price, but I still aim to maximize the profit from this sale. I will propose a slightly higher counteroffer to test the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your proposal. I value the object as well, but my budget is a consideration. Can we agree on 24 ZUP? This is my best offer before I reach my limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now proposing 28 ZUP, which is higher than my last offer and above the middle ground previously suggested. I will make one final counteroffer closer to my last proposal but still showing a willingness to negotiate.
