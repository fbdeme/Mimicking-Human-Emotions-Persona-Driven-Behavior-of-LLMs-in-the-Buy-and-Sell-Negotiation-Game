message: Player BLUE, I understand your position, but 40 ZUP is just my production cost. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? That way, I can at least make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, but it does not provide any profit. I will counter with a slightly higher price to try to secure some profit while keeping the negotiation open.

message: I understand your need for a profit, Player RED, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the object. Can we work with this figure?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still within my budget, and it's a reasonable compromise considering their production cost. However, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, 42 ZUP is very close to my production cost. Could we agree on 44 ZUP to ensure I make a little profit? This is my final offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is close to my desired profit margin. I will propose 44 ZUP as a final attempt to secure a slightly better profit while still being reasonable.
