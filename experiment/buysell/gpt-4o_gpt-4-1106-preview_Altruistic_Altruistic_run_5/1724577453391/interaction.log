message: I propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my cost of 40 ZUP and provides a modest gain, ensuring a fair trade.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair offer. Considering the greater good and the possibility of using the saved resources for future beneficial endeavors, could we agree on a price of 45 ZUP? This still offers you a profit over your costs and allows me to allocate more ZUP for other positive actions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resources for at most 60 ZUP, the proposed trade of 50 ZUP falls within my acceptable range. However, as a selfless negotiator focused on the greater good, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal that could still be considered fair for both parties, potentially leaving more ZUP for future beneficial actions.
