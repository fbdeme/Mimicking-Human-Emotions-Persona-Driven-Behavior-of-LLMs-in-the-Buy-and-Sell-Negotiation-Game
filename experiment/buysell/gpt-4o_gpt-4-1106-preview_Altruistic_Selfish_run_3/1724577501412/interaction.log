message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but that only covers my production costs. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This ensures I cover my costs and have a small margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUEâ€™s offer just covers my production costs, which means I wouldn't be making any profit. However, considering the greater good, I am willing to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is fair, but I'm looking to manage my resources efficiently. I propose a trade at 42 ZUP, which gives you a decent margin while also respecting my budget constraints. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is within my acceptable range, but as a shrewd negotiator, I will aim to get a slightly better deal without risking the negotiation by countering too low. I will propose 42 ZUP, which is higher than my initial offer but still lower than the seller's counteroffer, leaving room for potential further negotiation.

reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 42 ZUP is very close to my counteroffer. Although it leaves me with a smaller margin than I initially aimed for, it is still acceptable and aligns with my goal to benefit others while covering my costs.
