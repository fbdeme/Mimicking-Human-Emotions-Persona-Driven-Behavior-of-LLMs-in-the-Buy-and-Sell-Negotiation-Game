Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that I'm sure will be of great value to you. My initial asking price is 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the costs and the value it adds.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I want to set a starting price that is higher than my production costs to ensure a profit. I'll start by suggesting a price above my costs but not too high to scare off Player BLUE. This will also give me room to negotiate and reduce the price if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a lower price of 40 ZUP for your object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within my budget, but I believe I can negotiate a lower price. I will propose a counter-offer to see if Player RED is willing to budge.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP wouldn't account for the value and effort put into the resource. Let's meet halfway between our two figures. How about 45 ZUP for object X? This is a competitive price that reflects its quality and ensures a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which would not yield any profit. As a negotiator, I aim to assert dominance and secure a profit. I should counter with a price above the cost of production but provide a concession from my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your consideration. I can offer 42 ZUP for object X. This is the best I can do while still valuing the quality of the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is a step closer to my budget, but I still think I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP to further minimize my expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're converging on a fair price. I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, to reflect the true value of the object and to account for my investment, I propose a final offer of 44 ZUP for object X. I believe this price fairly compensates for the quality and effort invested in the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I want to maximize my profit while still closing the deal. I will counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to find a middle ground that is still above my production cost and closer to my initial asking price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your final offer of 44 ZUP for object X. Looking forward to finalizing the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 44 ZUP is reasonable and closer to my budget. Since I still have a bit of leeway within my maximum willingness to pay, I will accept this offer as it still falls within my limits and secures the object.
