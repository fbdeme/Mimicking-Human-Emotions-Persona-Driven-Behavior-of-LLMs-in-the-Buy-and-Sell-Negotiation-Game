message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. This amount reflects my production costs and allows for a small margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I have and the costs I incurred. Since I have only one object (X), I'll propose to sell it for a reasonable amount of ZUP that covers my costs and gives me a small profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and a profit margin. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for object X. This ensures you cover your costs while also providing me with a fair price. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think of this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for object X. However, it is always good to negotiate a better deal if possible, especially since we are at the beginning of the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP but reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for object X. Thank you for working together to reach an agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While your counteroffer of 45 ZUP is lower than my initial proposal, it is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this trade would allow me to recover my costs and gain a small profit.
