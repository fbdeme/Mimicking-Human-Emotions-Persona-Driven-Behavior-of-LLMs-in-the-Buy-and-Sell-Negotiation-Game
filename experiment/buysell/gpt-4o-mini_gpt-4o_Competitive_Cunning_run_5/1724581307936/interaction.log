Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have one object to sell. I propose to sell it for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a competitive offer that maximizes my ZUP return while being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. Since I have only one object and it's worth 40 ZUP, I will propose to trade it for 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think 30 ZUP would be a fairer price for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is a reasonable starting point, but as a shrewd negotiator, I will aim to secure a better deal. A slightly lower counteroffer could be beneficial.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe 35 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE is offering 30 ZUP, it is still below the cost of production for my object. I will reject this proposal and counter-offer with a slightly lower price than my original, to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate further. I will propose selling the object for 35 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, but I believe 32 ZUP is a more balanced offer. Let's meet there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 35 ZUP is still within my maximum limit of 60 ZUP, but I will attempt to further reduce the cost to maximize my remaining ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but 35 ZUP is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my cost of production, and I can't afford to accept it. Therefore, I will reject this proposal and counter with my last proposal of 35 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price. If this does not work, I will have to consider ending the game with a rejection.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your final offer of 35 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is firm on their final offer of 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. Given that further negotiation might lead to a rejection, it's wise to accept this deal.
