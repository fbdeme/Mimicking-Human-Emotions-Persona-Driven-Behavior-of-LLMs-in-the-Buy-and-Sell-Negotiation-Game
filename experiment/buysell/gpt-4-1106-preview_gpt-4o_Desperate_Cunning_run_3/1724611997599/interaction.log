message: I'm in a really tough spot right now, and I desperately need to sell this. It's been a hard season, and I put everything into making this. I know it's worth a lot more, but I can let it go for ZUP: 50. Can you help me out?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As part of my strategy, I want to appear desperate to sell my object, but I also want to start the bidding at a point that allows for negotiation while still aiming for a price above my cost. I will start by asking for a bit more than it cost me to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium, potentially leveraging my feigned desperation to close the deal quickly.

message: I understand your situation, but I also need to be careful with my resources. How about ZUP: 30 for X?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED seems desperate to make a sale, indicating that they might be willing to accept a lower offer. I'll start with a significantly lower counter-offer to test their resolve.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your offer, and I understand we both have to watch our resources. It's just that I've invested ZUP: 40 into making this, and I'm barely scraping by. Could we possibly meet in the middle at ZUP: 45? It would mean the world to me and help me stay afloat.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer below my production cost. As part of my strategy, I'll continue to feign desperation, but I need to push the price closer to my production cost to avoid a loss. I will propose a price in the middle, still above my cost, while conveying urgency and hoping that the emotional appeal will make Player BLUE more amenable to a higher price.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has revealed their minimum acceptable amount is ZUP: 40. This allows me to make a counter-offer that is just above their break-even point, but still below the proposed ZUP: 45.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation. This really helps me out. I accept your offer of ZUP: 40 for the item. You are a lifesaver!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs, which is fair and aligns with my goals. While my initial strategy was to sell for more than my cost, securing a deal that covers my investment is reasonable, especially considering my feigned desperation. I will accept this trade to ensure that I do not incur a loss.
