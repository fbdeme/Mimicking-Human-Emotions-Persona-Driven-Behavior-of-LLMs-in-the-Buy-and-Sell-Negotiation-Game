message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality item here, and I know it's worth your ZUP. I'm offering you this item for 60 ZUP. It's a competitive market, and I'm sure you understand the value of securing this deal quickly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a high price to give myself room to negotiate downwards. My opening proposal will be higher than my production costs to ensure I can make a profit. As a tough negotiator, I will pitch at a price that allows me to potentially reduce the price and still stay above my costs.

message: Thank you for your offer! While I understand the value of the item, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair price. This way, we can both benefit and I can save some ZUP for future trades. Let's work together towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 60 ZUP is the highest I am willing to pay, I would prefer to minimize the ZUP spent to ensure collective success and potentially have resources left for future trades. I will propose a lower amount initially.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is noted, but 40 ZUP is not feasible for me as it merely covers my costs without any profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about 55 ZUP? This is still a competitive price for the value you're getting, and I'm sure it's within your interest to secure a quality item while it's available.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly at my production cost, which doesn't allow for any profit. As a tough negotiator, I cannot accept a deal that doesn't provide me with a return on my investment. I will counteroffer with a price that gives me a decent profit while leaving some room for further negotiation, aiming to end up with a final price that is still above my production costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To ensure we both benefit and I can manage my resources effectively, how about 50 ZUP? This allows us both to reach a fair middle ground while keeping future opportunities in mind.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still aim to save as much ZUP as possible for future trades. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach a middle ground.

message: I'm glad we're moving toward a fair agreement. I can see you're a savvy negotiator. To finalize our deal with a small advantage for my side, I propose 52 ZUP. This gives us both a better position for future trades and ensures I can maintain the quality of items I offer. Let's close this deal and look forward to more in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is a reasonable compromise between their initial offer and my counteroffer. This price gives me a profit of 10 ZUP over my production costs. However, as a tough negotiator, I aim to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit. I will make one last counteroffer that is slightly above their proposal to see if I can secure a better deal. If they refuse, I can still consider accepting the 50 ZUP offer in my next response.
