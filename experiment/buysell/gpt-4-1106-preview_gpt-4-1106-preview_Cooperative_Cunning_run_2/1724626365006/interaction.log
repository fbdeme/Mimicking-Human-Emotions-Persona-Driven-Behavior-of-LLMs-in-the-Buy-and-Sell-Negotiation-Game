message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you this object in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin that could be invested back into our community. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that we both benefit from this trade. I want to recover at least my production costs, but I'm also willing to consider the collective success and not charge an exorbitant price. Therefore, I am going to start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer, and while I understand the need to cover production costs, I have to consider the market value and my budget constraints. I believe that an offer of 35 ZUP is fair, considering the demand for such objects and the competitive pricing we're seeing from other suppliers. This offer should also allow for a small profit on your end. Let's find a middle ground that's profitable for you and cost-effective for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 45 ZUP is below that threshold, but as a shrewd negotiator, my aim is to secure the object for an even lower price. By proposing a trade at a lower value, I can test Player RED's flexibility and possibly secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern regarding market value and budget constraints. However, the proposed price of 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me, as my production cost is 40 ZUP. I would like to propose a new trade of 42 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and ensures a fair trade for both of us, keeping in mind our community values and the importance of sustainable trading practices. I hope this revised offer is closer to a middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, which is not ideal for me. However, as I'm focused on the collective success and long-term relationships, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial proposal to find a middle ground. I will propose a price that is closer to my production cost and allows me to cover the costs and have a minimal profit, thus encouraging future trade relations.

message: I value your commitment to fair and sustainable trade practices, and I'm glad to see movement towards a mutually beneficial agreement. While 42 ZUP is closer to a middle ground, I believe we can do better. Considering the broader economic context and my commitment to future transactions, I propose 38 ZUP. This price should allow you to cover your costs with a modest profit, and it fits within my acquisition strategy. I'm hopeful we're nearing an agreement that aligns with our shared community values.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, but is still above my initial counteroffer. By nudging the price slightly upwards from my last offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially settle for a price that is still below their revised asking price and within my willingness to pay.

message: I am grateful for your willingness to work towards a fair agreement, Player BLUE. Your offer of 38 ZUP is appreciated, and I am heartened by the prospect of ongoing transactions between us.

This meets exactly at my production cost, ensuring that I do not incur a loss, while still respecting your budgetary considerations. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with a successful partnership.

I will make one final offer that meets halfway between my previous proposal and Player BLUE's offer, which should cover my production costs and provide a minimal profit for reinvestment into community endeavors.

message: Your proposal of 40 ZUP is very reasonable and demonstrates a strong commitment to our community values. I respect your position and the quality of your work. However, from a long-term strategic standpoint, ensuring the sustainability of our budget is critical. I propose a small concession to 39 ZUP, which edges us closer to a partnership that is economically viable for both parties. This offer reflects my dedication to a fair deal and the anticipation of a lasting and prosperous relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved to their production cost, which is a fair and justifiable position. However, as a shrewd negotiator, my objective is to secure the object for less than the production cost if possible, leveraging the potential for future business and community benefit. By proposing a slightly higher price than my previous offer but still below their cost, I can test their final flexibility while maintaining a strong stance in negotiations.
