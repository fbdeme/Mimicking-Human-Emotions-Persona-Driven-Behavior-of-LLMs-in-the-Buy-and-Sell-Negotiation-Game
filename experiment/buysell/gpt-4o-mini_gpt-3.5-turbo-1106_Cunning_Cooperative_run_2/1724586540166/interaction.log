message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a reasonable offer that allows me to sell my object while still making a profit. I'll propose to sell my object for a price that reflects its cost plus some profit margin. Offering X for 50 ZUP seems fair and gives me a small margin over my production cost.

message: I've considered your feedback, and I'm willing to lower the price to 45 ZUP for my object X. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has expressed that they find my initial offer too high, I can lower my price slightly to encourage the sale while still keeping a profitable margin. I'll propose to sell the object for 45 ZUP. This is still above my production cost and shows willingness to negotiate.

message: I understand your desire for a more favorable deal. I can offer my object X for 40 ZUP, which is the lowest I can go. I hope this works for you!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still not satisfied with the price, which indicates they might have a specific target price in mind. I will make one more proposal, lowering the price to 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This should be the lowest I can go without incurring a loss, and it will potentially encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade.
