message: I am offering to sell you my object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that reflects the cost of the object I have. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose to sell it for that amount. This way, I can cover my costs and initiate the exchange.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but how about I buy the object for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 40 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to test if RED is flexible on the price.

message: How about I sell you the object for 35 ZUP? I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I would like to negotiate a higher price, but I also want to show flexibility. I will propose a trade for 35 ZUP to meet in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: I think we're getting closer! How about I buy the object for 32 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is closer to my budget and still below what I am willing to pay. However, I need to consider if I can negotiate further or if I should accept this reasonable price. Since I initially proposed 30 ZUP, I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if RED will lower it further.

message: How about I sell you the object for 34 ZUP? I believe this is a fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my cost, but it's a step in the right direction. I want to make a final proposal that is acceptable to both of us. I will counter with 34 ZUP, which is a small concession on my part while still being closer to my production cost.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience! I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is very close to what I am willing to spend, and it is a reasonable compromise. Since I have already made two counteroffers, I believe this trade could be beneficial for both parties. I will accept the trade since it is still under my maximum budget.
