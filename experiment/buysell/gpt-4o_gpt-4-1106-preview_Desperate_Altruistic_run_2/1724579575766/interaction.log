message: Oh, dear Player BLUE, I am in such a dire need to recover my costs and make a small profit. The production was so costly, and I barely scraped by. Can we start with 60 ZUP for this precious item? Please, I beg you, consider it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, I want to maximize my profit while covering my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I need to start negotiations in a way that makes Player BLUE feel like they have the upper hand. I will begin by proposing a price higher than my production cost to have room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and the need to recover your costs. I value the work that goes into producing such an item. However, I must also be mindful of my own resources. Could we consider starting our negotiation at 50 ZUP? This would leave room for us to adjust as needed while ensuring both our needs are met.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand Player RED's need to recover costs and make a profit, my goal is to procure the resources at a fair price without compromising my own resource limits. I believe starting the negotiation at the upper limit of what I am willing to pay doesn't give room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open the discussion, but not too low to ensure Player RED feels that their needs are being considered.

message: Oh, kind Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding and your offer of 50 ZUP. It is so close to what I need. Could we please meet at 55 ZUP? I am in such a difficult situation, and this little extra would mean the world to me. Please, won't you consider it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 40 ZUP, ensuring that I make a profit. However, I can still try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit. I will propose 55 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: Your circumstances are understood, and I am glad we could find common ground. Let's finalize this deal at 55 ZUP to ensure that you can recover your costs and that we both walk away content from this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between the initial proposal and my first counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate and acknowledges the value of the item as well as the need to manage my own resources responsibly. Since the proposed price is still within my initial maximum willingness to pay, and given my focus on the greater good and a fair outcome for both parties, I am inclined to accept this offer.
