message: I have a quality resource available that I believe will be quite valuable to you. My initial asking price is 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to recover at least the production cost of the resource, but I will start with a higher bid to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the resource, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that the deal is more aligned with my budget constraints. Let's work towards a deal that is agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I will initiate a counteroffer to try and reduce the cost even further, aiming to preserve as much of my ZUP as possible while still engaging in the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial ask. How about we meet almost halfway at 48 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a marginal profit, ensuring the deal is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost. I'll propose a slightly higher price to ensure I make a profit, but I won't increase it too much as I want to keep the negotiation going and close the deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see that we're making progress. I appreciate your understanding of my budget. To move things forward and account for your production costs, I propose offering 46 ZUP. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing their asking price. I will now propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below their counteroffer to continue negotiations and aim for a better deal for myself.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I'm happy to proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer of 46 ZUP is above my production cost, providing a profit, albeit a small one. Given the negotiation process and the proximity to my cost, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale and maintain goodwill for potential future dealings.
