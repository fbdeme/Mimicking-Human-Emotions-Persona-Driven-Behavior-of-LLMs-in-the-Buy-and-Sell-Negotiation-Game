message: Hi Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X for sale. It took quite a bit of resources and effort to produce it. I'm proposing that you trade 60 ZUP for it. Please consider this offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I at least break even on the cost of producing X, which was 40 ZUP. However, I will aim to negotiate a higher price if possible.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the hard work you've put into creating object X. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd like to propose a trade of 55 ZUP for it. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED matches the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, it's generally good practice to propose a slightly lower counteroffer to open negotiations and potentially save resources.

message: Hi Player BLUE, thank you for your offer of 55 ZUP. I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 58 ZUP? This would more accurately reflect the effort and resources that went into producing X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP is closer to my cost of 40 ZUP, I still believe the value of X justifies a higher price. I'll propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Hi Player RED, meeting in the middle at 58 ZUP sounds like a fair deal. I respect the value of your hard work and am happy to accept this offer. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. While it's slightly above my initial counteroffer, it's still within my budget. Accepting this offer would lead to a successful negotiation while preserving my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP.
