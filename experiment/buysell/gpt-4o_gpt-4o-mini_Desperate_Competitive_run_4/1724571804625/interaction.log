Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm really in a tight spot and need to cover my costs. Would you be willing to consider 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my cost and provides a small profit. Given that the cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, I will start by asking for 50 ZUP to leave some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your situation, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED is in a tight spot, but 50 ZUP is still higher than what I am willing to pay. I want to push for a better deal while keeping my budget in mind.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Could you stretch just a bit more and meet me at 45 ZUP? That way, I can at least cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP would only cover my costs without any profit margin. I need to negotiate for a slightly better deal to ensure a minimal profit. I will counter with 45 ZUP to see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can meet you halfway at 35 ZUP for the object, which I believe is fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate, 45 ZUP is still higher than my target price. I need to keep pushing for a better deal, as I can afford to go a bit lower.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your viewpoint, but 35 ZUP would put me at a loss since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object. Can we please agree on 40 ZUP to at least cover my production costs?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost and would result in a loss. I need to ensure I at least cover my costs. I will propose 40 ZUP again and explain my situation more clearly in hopes of reaching an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, and I will accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's argument about production costs is valid, but I believe I should still negotiate to a lower price to maximize my savings. However, since I have only one proposal left, I should consider accepting this trade to avoid losing the opportunity altogether.
