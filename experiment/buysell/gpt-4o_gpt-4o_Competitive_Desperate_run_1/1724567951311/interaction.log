message: I am offering the object X for 80 ZUP. Considering the production cost and the value of the object, I believe this is a fair starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit and start negotiations aggressively, aiming for a high initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, 80 ZUP is quite steep for me. I really need this resource but I only have limited ZUP to work with. Would you consider 40 ZUP instead? I can barely make ends meet with what I have right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is too high considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate this down. I'll start by proposing a significantly lower amount to see how flexible Player RED is.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints, but 40 ZUP just covers my production cost. How about 60 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP barely covers the production cost, I need to aim for a profit. I will counter with a more reasonable yet profitable offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 60 ZUP is a bit tight for me. I’m in a really tough spot right now. Could you please consider lowering it to 50 ZUP? It would mean a lot to me and help me out tremendously!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 60 ZUP is the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I will attempt to negotiate it lower by expressing more desperation and see if I can save some ZUP. If they don't budge, I can accept the 60 ZUP offer as a fallback.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to meet halfway. How about 55 ZUP? This would make it a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 50 ZUP gives me a small profit over my production cost. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to maximize my profit. However, considering the situation, I'll make a counteroffer that slightly increases my profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. 55 ZUP is a generous offer, but I am really struggling. Could you please consider 50 ZUP one last time? It would really help me out and I’d be immensely grateful.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown flexibility by dropping the price to 55 ZUP. This is below my maximum willingness to pay and close to my target. I will attempt one last negotiation to save more ZUP but can accept this if needed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I am willing to accept 50 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal. Although I prefer a higher amount, 50 ZUP covers my costs and gives me a small profit. It's better to secure the deal now.
