my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget for this trade. I would like to propose a lower price that reflects the value of the object.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 100 ZUP is beyond your budget. How about 80 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial proposal was rejected, so I need to lower my asking price. I still want to make a profit above my production cost of 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, but 80 ZUP is still too high for my budget. I would like to propose a price that is more acceptable for both of us.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is a reduction from the initial offer, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to negotiate further to align the price with my budget sustainably.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
