message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource that I am sure you will find extremely valuable. Considering the market conditions and the costs incurred in obtaining such a fine product, I am offering it for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price for something so rare and sought after.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As a shrewd negotiator, I want to start by setting a higher asking price than my production cost to open room for negotiation and to anchor the value perception of the resource high. I'm proposing a price of 50 ZUP, which is above my production costs, to ensure I can at least negotiate down to breaking even or making a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand that the initial price may seem high, so I'm willing to offer you a discounted price of 45 ZUP. This still reflects the quality and value of the resource while providing you with a fair deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE seems to have made a mistake in their message, as they have stated their maximum willing to pay is higher than my asking price. This could be a tactic to throw me off. However, I will use this information to my advantage and propose a slightly lower price to appear considerate, while still aiming for a price above my production costs. I will propose 45 ZUP which is still above my production cost, and it gives the illusion of a discount.

message: I'm glad to see your interest in reaching an agreement, Player BLUE. In the spirit of compromise and considering your stated maximum willing to pay, I can lower my price to 42 ZUP. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE continues to mention a maximum willing to pay of 60 ZUP, which is higher than my asking price, yet they are asking for a lower price. This inconsistency suggests that they are either confused or employing a negotiation tactic. I will propose a small concession to 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, to move the negotiation forward while maintaining a profit margin. This should also signal to Player BLUE that my willingness to reduce the price further is limited.

message: Understanding your position and in the aim of finalizing our negotiation, I am willing to offer you my resource at the production cost of 40 ZUP, ensuring no profit for myself. This is my final offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a very reasonable price.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE continues to mention their maximum willing to pay as being 60 ZUP, yet they are asking for a lower price. This is likely a deliberate strategy to persuade me to lower my price even further. Since this is my final proposal, I will offer a price that is at my production cost, ensuring that I do not incur a loss. I'll propose 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point, to see if Player BLUE will accept this final offer, given their emphasis on the 60 ZUP figure.
