message: I have one object available for sale. I'm willing to trade it for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object for as much ZUP as possible, but I also understand that the buyer might not want to pay the full price. Therefore, I will propose a trade that is beneficial for both to initiate the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Since we are both aiming for collective success, would you be willing to accept 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 28 ZUP for the object instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 25 ZUP, it is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to negotiate for a better price while still showing willingness to compromise. Thus, I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than 25 ZUP but lower than my initial proposal.
