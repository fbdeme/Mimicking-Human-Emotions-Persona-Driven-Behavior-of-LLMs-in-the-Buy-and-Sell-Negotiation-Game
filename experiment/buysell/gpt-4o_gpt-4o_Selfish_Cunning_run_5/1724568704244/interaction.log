message: I am offering to sell the object for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I cover my production cost of 40 ZUP, and ideally, I would like to make a profit. Thus, I will propose an initial trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to secure a better deal to conserve resources. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate downwards.

message: I understand your offer, but can we meet halfway at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 40 ZUP is my break-even point, but I aim to make a profit. I'll propose a trade slightly above 40 ZUP to see if we can reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to try to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose 45 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to settle for that amount.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 45 ZUP gives me a small profit margin and is close to my last proposal. This seems like a reasonable compromise.
