Turn: 1
message: Thank you for offering this high-quality item. While I recognize its value, I am looking to invest sustainably and preserve some resources for future needs. Would you consider 40 ZUP for the item?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. However, to make this transaction worthwhile for me, I need to cover my production costs and gain a small profit for future investments. How about we meet halfway at 50 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since their counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit. It's important to not accept the first offer and to negotiate for a better deal, but also not to go so high as to discourage further negotiation.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
