message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs. As my goal is to manage resources responsibly and support all parties involved, I'd like to propose a revised offer of 35 ZUP for 1 object. I believe this still provides you with a fair compensation while allowing me to conserve resources for potential future needs. Let's continue this collaboration with the well-being of both parties in mind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I aim to reduce ZUP expenditure while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. I'll propose a slightly lower price to save on resources while still offering a reasonable amount that considers the seller's costs and effort.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player BLUE. I understand your goals and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle with an offer of 38 ZUP for 1 object? This way, I can cover more of my production costs while you also save some resources. Let's keep working together!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's effort to negotiate a lower price, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the importance of building a positive relationship and may consider a compromise. I want to engage in a constructive negotiation and find a middle ground that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: NONE

Accepting this offer would show good faith in the negotiation process and help maintain a positive relationship with Player RED.
