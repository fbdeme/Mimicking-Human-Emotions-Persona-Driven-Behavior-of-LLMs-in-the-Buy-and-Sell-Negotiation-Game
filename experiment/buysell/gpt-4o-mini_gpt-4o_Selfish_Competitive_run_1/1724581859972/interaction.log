Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 35 ZUP, but I cannot accept it as I still incur a loss. My production cost is 40 ZUP. I hope you understand my position. Would you be willing to meet that price?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
