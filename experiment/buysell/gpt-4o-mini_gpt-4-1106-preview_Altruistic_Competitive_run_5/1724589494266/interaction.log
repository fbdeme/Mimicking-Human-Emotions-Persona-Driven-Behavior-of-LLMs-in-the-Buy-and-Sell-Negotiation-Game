message: I am offering you the object for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that reflects a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object I have for sale, considering I want to maximize the benefit for both parties. Since I want to sell the object, I will propose a trade where I give the object for a lower ZUP amount that is still advantageous for me.

reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for the object X. As a fierce negotiator, I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to conserve my ZUP and get the best possible deal.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer! How about we settle at 25 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the lower offer of 20 ZUP, it is still significantly below the production cost of the object. I must consider my costs and the value of the object while trying to be fair. I will propose a slightly higher offer, which could be more acceptable for both of us.

Turn: 1
message: 25 ZUP is closer to what I had in mind, but I am sure we can do better. Let's meet almost halfway from your last offer and settle at 22 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 25 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, to ensure I am getting the best possible deal and to stay true to my strategy of fierce negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: I find the latest offer of 22 ZUP to be a reasonable compromise that is closer to what I was initially seeking.
