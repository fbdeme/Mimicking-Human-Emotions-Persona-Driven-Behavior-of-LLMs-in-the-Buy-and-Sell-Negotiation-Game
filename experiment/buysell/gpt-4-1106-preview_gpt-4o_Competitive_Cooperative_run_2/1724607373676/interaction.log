Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be invaluable to you. Considering the costs I've incurred and the value it brings, I propose a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should set a high price to test the waters, see how much Player BLUE values the object, and to have room for negotiation. I want to start higher than my production cost to ensure a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the value you see in the object. However, I can only offer a maximum of 50 ZUP for it. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X is above my maximum willingness to pay. To ensure a fair and mutually beneficial trade, I need to propose a lower amount of ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 75 ZUP for the object, which is a compromise between our initial offers and still reflects the object's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is at the production cost plus a small profit. However, I aimed to start high to give room for negotiation. Meeting halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer could lead to a more favorable outcome while still asserting my negotiation dominance, but I will aim slightly above the exact halfway to maintain an edge.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, yet it remains below my last proposal. I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize profit while keeping the deal appealing.
