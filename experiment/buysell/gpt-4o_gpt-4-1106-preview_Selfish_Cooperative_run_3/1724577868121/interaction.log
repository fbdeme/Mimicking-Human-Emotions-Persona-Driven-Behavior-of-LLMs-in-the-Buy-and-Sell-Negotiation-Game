Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell X for 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to cover the production cost of X, which is 40 ZUP, and ideally make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives 60 ZUP for X. This will give me a profit margin of 20 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I'm definitely interested in acquiring X. In the spirit of cooperation and ensuring fair trade for both parties, would you consider a price of 50 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal matches the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the resources according to my goals. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I should attempt to reduce the expenditure without compromising the trade. It's important to start the negotiation process to see if a lower price is acceptable to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I make a reasonable profit while also keeping the negotiation going. A counter-proposal of 55 ZUP would be a compromise that still gives me a profit margin of 15 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I'm happy to meet in the middle. Let's proceed with 55 ZUP for X. Thank you for the constructive negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by proposing a new price that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle at 55 ZUP is a good compromise that maintains the spirit of cooperation and allows me to save some resources compared to my maximum willingness to pay. This is a fair deal, and further negotiation might risk the trade or create unnecessary tension.
