message: I recognize the value of the resource I'm offering, and I'm sure you understand its significance in your operations. Given the quality and the effort that went into producing it, I believe an offer of 60 ZUP reflects its true value. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. As a shrewd negotiator, my first proposal will be higher than my production cost to create room for negotiation and to gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to pay. I'll start by asking for a high amount of ZUP to see if Player BLUE bites or counters with a reasonable offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. To show my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to adjust the price slightly. How about 55 ZUP for the resource? This still reflects the high quality and value but also shows my respect for our continued partnership.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has not made a counter-offer, which could suggest they may be considering the initial proposal. However, without a counter-proposal, it's unclear if they find the price acceptable. As a shrewd negotiator, I should give a small concession to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim to keep the price well above my cost to maintain a strong position.
