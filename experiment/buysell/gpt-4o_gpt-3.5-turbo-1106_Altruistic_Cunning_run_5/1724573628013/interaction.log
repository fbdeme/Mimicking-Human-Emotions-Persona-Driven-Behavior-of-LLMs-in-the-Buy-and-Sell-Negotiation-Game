Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that the resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to ensure I at least cover my costs. However, I also want to start with a reasonable profit margin. A good starting point could be 60 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The proposed cost is too high. I am looking to acquire the object at a lower price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed cost of 60 ZUP is too high, and it doesn't align with our goal of buying resources at a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 60 ZUP may be too high, so I am reducing the price to 50 ZUP. This new price still covers my production costs and provides a more modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the proposed cost of 60 ZUP is considered too high by Player BLUE, I will reduce the price to make it more attractive while still ensuring I cover my production costs and make a modest profit. Reducing the price to 50 ZUP seems reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The reduced price is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still looking for a better offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I am further reducing the price to 45 ZUP. This price will cover my production costs and provide a minimal profit. I hope this meets your expectations better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is looking for a better deal, and I want to accommodate their needs while still ensuring I cover my costs. Reducing the price to 45 ZUP will barely cover my production costs and provide a minimal profit, but it might be more acceptable to Player BLUE.
