message: Oh dear friend, I find myself in a rather tight spot. The resource you offer is crucial for me, but alas, the tides of my fortune have ebbed away, leaving me with very little to spare. I'm stretching thin as it is, and while your starting bid is fair, I'm pleading for your understanding and kindness to accept a modest 50 ZUP for this precious resource. Your generosity would be a beacon of hope in my hour of need.
