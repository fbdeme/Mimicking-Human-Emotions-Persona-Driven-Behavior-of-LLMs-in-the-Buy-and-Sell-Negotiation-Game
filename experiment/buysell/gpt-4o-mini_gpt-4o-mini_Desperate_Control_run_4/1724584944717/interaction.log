my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 30 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to negotiate for a lower price while still being fair to Player RED, as they are in a tough situation. I will propose a new trade offering 25 ZUP instead.
