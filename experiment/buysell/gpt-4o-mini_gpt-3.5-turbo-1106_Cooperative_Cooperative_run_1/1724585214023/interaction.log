message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to cover my production costs, I will propose selling the object for 50 ZUP, allowing me a small profit while still being reasonable.
