message: I have a valuable object for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth more due to its quality and rarity, so I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should aim to make a profit. However, since this is the first proposal and I do not know the willingness of Player BLUE to pay, I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer for the object. I can offer 55 ZUP for it instead. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to purchase the valuable object but I believe I can negotiate a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly higher than the initial offer to show my interest while also trying to keep the cost lower than their perceived value.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and also above the initial asking price. This is a good deal as it ensures a profit. Accepting this offer aligns with my goal to sell the resource for more than it cost to produce.
