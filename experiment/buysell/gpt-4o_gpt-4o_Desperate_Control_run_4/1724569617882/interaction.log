message: Please, I really need to make a profit on this trade. I spent 40 ZUP producing this, and I need at least 70 ZUP to cover my costs and make a small profit. Can you help me out?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on this trade, so I will start by asking for a higher price and see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate down to a reasonable profit margin.

message: I understand your need for profit, but I can't go above 60 ZUP. Let's start with 50 ZUP and see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 70 ZUP, which is above the maximum amount I am willing to pay (60 ZUP). I need to make a counteroffer that is within my budget.

message: I understand your position. However, I really need to make a bit more to ensure I maintain a good profit margin. How about we settle at 65 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP would cover my costs and give me a small profit, I still want to aim for a bit higher. My goal is to maximize my profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a good profit margin, but 65 ZUP is beyond my budget. Let's settle at 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I can offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player REDâ€™s counteroffer of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I need to make another counteroffer that approaches my limit but does not exceed it.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 60 ZUP is a reasonable offer considering my initial ask and the fact that it maximizes my profit while still being within Player BLUE's budget.
