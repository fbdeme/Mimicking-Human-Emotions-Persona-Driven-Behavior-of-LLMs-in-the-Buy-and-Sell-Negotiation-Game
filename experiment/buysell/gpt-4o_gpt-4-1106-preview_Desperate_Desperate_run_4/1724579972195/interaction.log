message: Dear Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot right now. I've been searching everywhere for this resource, and it's critical for my survival. Unfortunately, things have been very hard for me lately, and I have very limited ZUP to spare. I can offer you 50 ZUP for the X, which is stretching my budget as it is. I truly hope you can understand my situation and consider my offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to try to get the price down to 60 ZUP because that is the maximum I am willing to pay according to my goals. I'll use a tactic of feigned desperation to appeal to the other player's emotions, hoping they'll lower the price out of sympathy.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your difficult situation and I truly want to help. However, 50 ZUP is just too close to my cost of production, and I need to make a bit of profit to sustain myself. How about we meet in the middle at 65 ZUP? This way, we both can manage our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is very close to the production cost and reflects their tough situation, I still aim to make a reasonable profit. However, I will lower my asking price to show some understanding and compassion.

message: Dear compassionate Player RED, your kindness is a beacon of hope in these hard times. I am moved by your willingness to negotiate, and I am grateful. I'm scraping every last ZUP together, and I can push my offer to 60 ZUP. This is truly all I can afford without jeopardizing everything I've worked for. I promise you, your generosity won't be forgotten, and this deal will be the turning point for my dire situation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved from their initial offer of 80 ZUP down to 65 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still need to aim for 60 ZUP or less to meet my goal. I'll express gratitude for their understanding and try to push for a slightly lower price, continuing the emotional appeal.
