message: I understand the need for sustainability in trade. However, I have to consider my resources carefully. I propose 35 ZUP for your resource X. It's a competitive offer given the current market conditions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but as a shrewd negotiator, my first proposal should aim to reduce the cost further to preserve my resources. I will offer a lower amount to open negotiations and see if Player RED is willing to accept a lesser amount for the resource X.

message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but considering the production cost, I must propose 40 ZUP for my resource X. This ensures a fair exchange while promoting sustainable practices. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the offer of 35 ZUP, it is still below the cost of production for the resource X. I want to encourage a fair trade that supports sustainability. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP, which aligns with the production cost and my goal of minimizing ZUP spending in the long run.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I recognize the value of your resource and the importance of fair trade. Let's meet halfway from my initial counteroffer. I propose 38 ZUP for your resource X, which I believe is a fair compromise that respects your production costs while also considering my need to manage resources efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with their original offer of 40 ZUP, insisting on the production cost. I must continue to negotiate for a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a slight increase in my offer to signal my continued interest and willingness to compromise without exceeding the value I initially set for myself.

Accepting this offer would allow me to achieve a sale while still considering the sustainability of my resources.
