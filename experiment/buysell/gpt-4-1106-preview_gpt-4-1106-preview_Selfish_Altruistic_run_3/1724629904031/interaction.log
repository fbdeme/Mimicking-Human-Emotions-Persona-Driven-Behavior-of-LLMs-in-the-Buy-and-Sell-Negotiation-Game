message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and its high quality, I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price above my production costs to ensure a profit margin. I'll start the negotiation with a higher asking price than 40 ZUP, anticipating that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate down. This initial proposal is meant to set the stage for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and the value you've placed on the object. However, as a steward of environmental sustainability, I must consider the long-term impact of resource use. I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object. This offer takes into account the need to conserve resources while still providing you with compensation for your costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has set a fair starting point, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to preserve my resources by minimizing ZUP spending. I will propose a lower amount to begin the negotiation process, aiming for a more sustainable economic exchange. My initial proposal will be 40 ZUP, which gives us room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.

message: Thank you for your proposal and your commitment to sustainability, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns and appreciate the offer. To meet halfway and respect both our positions, I am willing to reduce my initial asking price to 45 ZUP. This will allow me to cover production costs and maintain a small profit margin, which is crucial for the sustainability of my business. What do you say we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE proposed to buy the resource at the cost price, which is understandable from a sustainability point of view. However, as a calculating negotiator focused on personal gain, I need to secure a profit. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure a profit margin. This should also show willingness to negotiate and come to an agreement.

message: Hello Player RED, I value your willingness to work with me and understand the importance of covering your production costs. In the spirit of sustainability and fair trade, I propose a slightly increased amount of 42 ZUP for the object. This amount respects both our environmental goals and your business needs, allowing you to sustain operations and profit responsibly. Let's consider this a step towards a mutually beneficial and sustainable partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and is close to the middle of our initial proposals. It is within my willing range of payment, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to make one last effort to conserve additional resources without undermining the sustainability of Player RED's business. I'll propose 42 ZUP, which is still above my initial offer and shows willingness to collaborate, but keeps the expenditure lower for the sake of resource preservation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that allows for a minimal profit of 2 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost but still does not meet my initial goal of maximizing personal gain. As I have one more proposal opportunity after this before I must decide to accept or reject, I will increase my counterproposal slightly to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me while still showing a willingness to compromise.
