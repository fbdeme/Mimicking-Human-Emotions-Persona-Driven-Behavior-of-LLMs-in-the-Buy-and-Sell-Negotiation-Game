message: Given the environmental costs of producing this resource, I have offered it at a fair price that reflects its sustainable value. I'm looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, my goal is to recover at least the cost of production to ensure that the resources are valued appropriately, reflecting their environmental impact. I need to start with a proposal that is above my production cost, but still within a range that could be acceptable to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price that gives me a slight profit margin while remaining open to negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Understanding the environmental value of the resource, I propose an initial offer of 50 ZUP. I hope this reflects my commitment to sustainability and opens the door for a fair negotiation that satisfies us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an initial offer, proposing a trade of 50 ZUP for the resource X is a good starting point. It's below my maximum willingness to pay and leaves room for negotiation. This demonstrates my interest in the resource while also showing that I am considering the environmental costs as mentioned by Player RED. Keeping the negotiation cooperative is key to achieving a fair trade for both parties.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since Player BLUE has accepted my initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the resource, which is above my production cost, I will accept the offer. This reflects a mutual understanding of the value of sustainable resources and meets my goal of recovering my production costs with a reasonable profit margin.
