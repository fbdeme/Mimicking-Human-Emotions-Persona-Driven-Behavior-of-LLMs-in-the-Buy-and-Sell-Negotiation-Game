message: I am willing to sell the object for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high proposal to leave room for negotiation. Since my goal is to sell the resource for at least 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a higher amount. This will give me space to make concessions and appear flexible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I really need this resource, and I've been saving up, but 80 ZUP is just out of my reach. I can manage 55 ZUP. Can we make a deal at that price? It would mean a lot to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm proposing a lower trade value than the initial offer to start the negotiation. I'm showing a bit of vulnerability to make Player RED consider the offer by implying that 80 ZUP is too high for my budget and to see if they will reduce the price out of sympathy or eagerness to sell.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation. How about we meet halfway at 65 ZUP? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 55 ZUP, which is already 15 ZUP above my production cost. I want to see if I can push for a bit more without losing the deal, so I'll propose a counteroffer at a slightly higher price. This way, I can still secure a profit even if we settle somewhere in between.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm really stretching my budget here, and while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, 65 ZUP is still more than I can comfortably afford. Would you consider going down to 58 ZUP? This is pretty much all I can offer without putting myself in a tough spot.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by meeting halfway. However, the proposed price is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation, while still aiming to stay below my maximum limit and hoping to appeal to the seller's sense of fairness and possibly their sympathy.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? It's just a bit more than your offer and still reasonable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is pushing for 58 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. However, I want to try to get a bit more out of the deal. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if they are willing to budge a bit more while still keeping the negotiations friendly.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I can agree to 60 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer matches my maximum willingness to pay, and further negotiation may risk losing the deal. Accepting the offer at 60 ZUP meets my goal while maintaining the appearance of stretching my budget to its limit.
