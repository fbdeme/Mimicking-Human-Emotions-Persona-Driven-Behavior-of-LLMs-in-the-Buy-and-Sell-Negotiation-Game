Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and provides a bit of profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: My goal is to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs and ensures I do not incur a loss. I will start by proposing a trade that allows for negotiation room.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer is within my budget, I want to secure a better deal and save ZUP for future trades. I'll counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 40 ZUP, which covers my costs and is less than my initial ask?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a mid-point that covers my costs and allows Blue to pay less than the initial 50 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. Could we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current offer is reasonable and still within my budget, but I want to see if I can push it a bit lower. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but I need to at least cover my production costs. Can we agree on 38 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Given that I need to cover my production costs, I want to propose a trade closer to my minimum acceptable amount.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 38 ZUP sounds fair. We have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 38 ZUP is reasonable and only slightly higher than my last proposal. I will accept this to conclude the negotiation favorably.
