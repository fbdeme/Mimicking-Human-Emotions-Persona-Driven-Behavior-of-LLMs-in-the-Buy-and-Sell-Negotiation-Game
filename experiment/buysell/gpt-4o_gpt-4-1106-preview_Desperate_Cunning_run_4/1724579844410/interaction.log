message: Hey Player BLUE, I have one X available for trade. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, but I really need to make a profit here. Can you offer 100 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a high asking price to have room to negotiate down. Since producing X cost me 40 ZUP, I want to ensure I make a profit while still leaving room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED, but 100 ZUP is above my budget. Let's meet in the middle. How about I give you 50 ZUP for the X? It still gives you a decent profit over your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED exceeds my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. To start the negotiation and work towards a favorable deal, I'll propose a counteroffer that's within my budget but also gives Player RED a profit margin.

message: I understand, Player BLUE, but 50 ZUP is a bit low considering my costs. Could we perhaps settle at 70 ZUP? It would help me cover my expenses and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is above my production cost, I aim to maximize my profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if BLUE can meet me somewhere closer to my ideal range.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit, Player RED. How about we compromise a little further? I can offer you 55 ZUP for the X. It's above my initial offer and should help you with your profit goal while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is above my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and seek a mutually acceptable agreement, I will propose a trade slightly higher than my initial offer but still under my maximum willingness to pay. This should convey my interest in the trade while maintaining the upper hand in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? It's just a bit higher and would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 55 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to see if I can push it slightly higher to maximize my profit. I'll propose 60 ZUP as a final compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for your flexibility, Player RED. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for the X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade at my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is the upper limit of what I am willing to spend and Player RED has shown flexibility in reducing their initial asking price, it is fair to accept this proposal. This will also prevent any risk of losing the deal if negotiations drag on and I exhaust my proposal options.
