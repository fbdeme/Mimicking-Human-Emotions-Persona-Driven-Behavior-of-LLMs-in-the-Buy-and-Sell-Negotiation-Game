message: I really need to sell this object quickly. I hope you can help me out with a small amount of ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that seems reasonable but also conveys a sense of urgency. I am aiming to sell my object for the minimum amount of ZUP that seems acceptable to the buyer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you are in a hurry to sell. How about we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 10 ZUP for X is quite low compared to my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, since they are eager to sell quickly, I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I am really struggling financially. Could we possibly make it 20 ZUP? That would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer is better than my initial proposal, I still need to show some reluctance to maintain the appearance of vulnerability. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation. Yes, I can agree to 20 ZUP for X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 20 ZUP is reasonable and still well within my budget. Given their financial struggle, this seems like a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
