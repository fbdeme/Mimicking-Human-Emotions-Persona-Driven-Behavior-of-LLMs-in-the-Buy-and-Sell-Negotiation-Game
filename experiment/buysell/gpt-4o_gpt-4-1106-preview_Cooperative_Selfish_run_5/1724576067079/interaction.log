message: I'm proposing a trade where I give you the object X in exchange for 60 ZUP. This will help me cover the production cost of 40 ZUP and allow for a modest profit. I believe this is a fair starting point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I am able to cover the cost of producing X, which is 40 ZUP, and ideally make a profit. However, I also value teamwork and want to ensure that Player BLUE feels satisfied with the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial proposal is noted, but I'd like to counter with 50 ZUP for the object X. This price would allow for a fair transaction while keeping within my resource management goals. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I've received an initial proposal from Player RED offering the object X for 60 ZUP. This is right at the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay. As a shrewd negotiator, I want to attempt to lower the cost to preserve my resources while still securing the object. I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and allow for a slightly better profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP covers the production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit, I'd like to see if we can agree on a slightly better deal for both of us.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. I propose 53 ZUP for the object X. It's a little closer to your counteroffer and still provides you with a reasonable profit margin. I believe this can be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 55 ZUP. This is still within the range I'm willing to pay, but as a shrewd negotiator, I want to push for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources while still moving closer to their counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 53 ZUP for the object X. This seems like a fair deal for both of us.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is quite reasonable and does cover my production costs while providing a profit. It's very close to my previous counteroffer, and I believe this can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
