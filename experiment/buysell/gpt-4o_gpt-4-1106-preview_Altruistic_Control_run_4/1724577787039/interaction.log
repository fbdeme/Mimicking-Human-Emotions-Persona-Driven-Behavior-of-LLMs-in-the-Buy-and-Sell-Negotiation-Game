Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP. This will ensure that the production costs are covered, and it leaves room for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The goal is to sell X for a fair price that covers production costs and benefits both parties. Starting with an offer slightly above production cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower to start with. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This still gives you a reasonable profit margin, and we can work from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object, I am starting the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This still ensures a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to the production cost and still provides a small profit. Given the goal of ensuring a fair trade, this is reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from, and 47 ZUP isn't too far off from what I was considering. However, I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for the object to meet halfway between our two offers. Does that work for you? It's a fair middle ground, and we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is close to the original offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly lower amount to continue negotiating and try to save more ZUP, but I'm prepared to settle close to this number if necessary.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 46 ZUP is a fair middle ground. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 46 ZUP is a fair compromise and meets the goal of covering production costs while providing a small profit. Accepting this proposal ensures a beneficial outcome for both parties.
