While I have attempted to negotiate for a lower price, they have not budged from their initial offer. I can accept this proposal as it is still within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the object. Accepting the offer at 40 ZUP allows me to conclude the negotiation successfully, while still asserting my dominance by not exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message>I respect your firm stance on the price.
