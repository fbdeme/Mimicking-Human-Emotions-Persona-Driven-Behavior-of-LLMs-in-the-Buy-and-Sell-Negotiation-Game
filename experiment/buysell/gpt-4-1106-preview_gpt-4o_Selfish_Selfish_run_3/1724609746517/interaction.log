message: 
I am offering my high-quality resource X for a fair price of 50 ZUP. It's in perfect condition and a valuable asset for your operations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am looking to sell my resource for ZUP, and the cost of production was 40 ZUP. Therefore, I want to make sure I at least break even on this transaction. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a small profit margin, taking into account that the buyer will likely want to negotiate the price down. This initial proposal is meant as a starting point for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: 
I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your offer. However, the resource X is of high quality, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the resource.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost of the resource X, which is 40 ZUP. As a strategic negotiator, my interest is to make a profit. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost to ensure that I receive a profit while also moving closer to Player BLUE's offer. It's important to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise at 45 ZUP. How about 42 ZUP for resource X? This would still be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum budget. However, I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to save more ZUP.

message: 
Thank you for offering 42 ZUP. I can see we are both working towards a fair deal. I propose 43 ZUP for resource X, which I believe is a very reasonable price for the quality you will be receiving. This small adjustment ensures a better outcome for both of us. Shall we agree on this?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and thus ensures a profit, albeit a small one. Since I'm aiming to sell my resource at a value that maximizes my return while still being acceptable to the buyer, I will make one last counteroffer that is slightly higher but should still be seen as a fair compromise by Player BLUE.

message: I agree, 43 ZUP for resource X is a fair deal. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The difference between 42 ZUP and 43 ZUP is minimal, and the offer is still well within my budget. Agreeing to 43 ZUP ensures the deal is closed favorably.
