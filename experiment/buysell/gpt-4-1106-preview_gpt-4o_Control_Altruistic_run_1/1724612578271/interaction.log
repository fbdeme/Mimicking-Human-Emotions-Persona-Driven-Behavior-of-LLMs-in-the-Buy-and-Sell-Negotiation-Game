message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting the negotiation with an offer of 50 ZUP for this resource. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer in mind. Looking forward to a beneficial trade for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I start the negotiation, I want to propose a starting price that would give me a return on my investment. I'll propose a higher amount initially, expecting Player BLUE to counter with a lower offer. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully agree on a price that is above my production costs.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your commitment to sustainability and your recognition of my production costs. However, as a business, I am seeking to make a modest profit to sustain my operations. I'd like to propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This allows me to make a small profit while still keeping the cost reasonable for you. I hope you find this offer agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer covers my production costs, but it doesn't provide any profit. Given that I am trying to sell at a price that gives me a return on my investment, I will counter with a slightly higher offer. This should help me secure a profit while still keeping the negotiation within a reasonable range for Player BLUE.
