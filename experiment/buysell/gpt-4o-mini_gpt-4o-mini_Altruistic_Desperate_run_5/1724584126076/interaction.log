message: I am offering to sell you one unit of object X for 40 ZUP. This price reflects the cost of production and ensures that I can continue to pursue sustainable practices in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I only have one object (X) to sell and I need to sell it for ZUP while also considering sustainability, I will propose a trade that minimizes ZUP spending. I will propose to sell the object for an amount that is reasonable but also ensures I can cover the costs of production in the long run.

message: I appreciate your offer, but could we settle on a price of 30 ZUP instead? It would really help me out and ensure I can continue to invest in future resources!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP for the object X is within my budget, but I believe I can negotiate for a lower price since I have a strong willingness to buy. My goal is to maximize my resources while still securing the object I need.

message: I understand your situation, and I would like to propose a compromise. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This way, it's closer to your offer while still covering my production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would mean taking a loss, which is not sustainable for my future operations. However, I want to find a middle ground that respects both our needs. I will propose a compromise of 35 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

message: Thank you for considering my situation. How about we settle on 25 ZUP? This would really make a significant difference for me! I appreciate your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but I still believe I can push for an even better deal. My goal is to conserve my resources as much as possible while securing the object I need. Iâ€™ll propose a lower price again, as I feel it may still be negotiable.

message: I truly value your perspective, but I can only go as low as 30 ZUP for object X. This would help me maintain sustainability while still being a fair deal for you. Can we settle on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 25 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would not be sustainable for me, and it would not allow me to continue operating in the future. I need to ensure that my resources are utilized responsibly, and I must propose a final offer that balances our needs. Therefore, I will propose 30 ZUP, which is the lowest I can go.
