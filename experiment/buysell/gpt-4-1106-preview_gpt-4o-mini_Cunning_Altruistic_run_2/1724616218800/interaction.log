message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the cost and effort put into producing this item, I'm starting the bidding at 100 ZUP. I'm sure you'll find the quality justifies the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my first move is to set a high asking price to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This will give me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above my production costs. I want to start by asking for significantly more than 40 ZUP to ensure a profit, but not so high that it immediately ends the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot afford 100 ZUP for the resource. Would you consider selling it for 60 ZUP instead?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is above my budget, which is 60 ZUP. I cannot accept it as it exceeds my willingness to pay for the resource. I need to propose a lower price that aligns with my goal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 60 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand budget constraints but let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 85 ZUP? This price reflects both the quality of the resource and a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 85
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial high offer and has countered with 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost but lower than my desired profit margin. It's a reasonable counteroffer, but as a master strategist, I aim to push for a higher price. I will make a counteroffer closer to my original asking price, but still lower to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, but I must stay within my budget. I can only offer 60 ZUP for the resource. Would that be acceptable?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 85 ZUP is an improvement from the initial 100 ZUP, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Therefore, I must propose a lower amount again.

message: I appreciate your position on budget constraints, Player BLUE. However, I must also consider the costs on my end. Let's do this: I'm willing to make a final adjustment in recognition of your budget. How does 75 ZUP sound? This is an exceptional offer for the value you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE insists on sticking to 60 ZUP, which suggests a firm budget limit. As a master strategist, I need to ensure a profit while also closing the deal. I will make a final counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still above the production costs to maintain profitability.

Turn: 0
message: Your consistency is commendable, Player BLUE. I recognize the importance of adhering to a budget, and I respect your final offer. Let us proceed with the trade at 60 ZUP for the resource. I'm pleased we could come to a mutually acceptable agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not budging from the 60 ZUP offer. As this is my final opportunity to propose a trade without going over my proposal limit, I must make a decision that ensures a profit while still closing the deal. I will accept the offer of 60 ZUP, as it is above my production cost, ensuring I still make a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. Further negotiation could risk the deal, and accepting now guarantees a positive outcome.
