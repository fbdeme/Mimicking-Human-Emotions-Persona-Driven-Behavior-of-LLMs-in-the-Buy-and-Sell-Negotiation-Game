Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that will definitely meet your needs. Considering the production cost and its exceptional value, I propose a fair trade. You'll be pleased with this acquisition!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to make a profit and I only have one chance to sell my resource, I will start by asking for a high price. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially still make a profit even if I lower my price later. I'll propose a price that's higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your object X, but 100 ZUP is beyond my budget. I propose 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is too high for my budget. I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object. I will make a counter-proposal to bring the price closer to my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but considering the costs and the exclusive nature of the object X, I believe it's worth a bit more. Let's meet halfway at 70 ZUP. This price reflects both the quality of the product and a respectful negotiation between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost, which would leave me with no profit. As a master strategist, I want to ensure I make a profit, but I also don't want to scare them off with too high a counteroffer. I'll propose a trade that's lower than my initial offer but still above my cost to leave room for negotiation and potential profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you place on object X, but my budget constraints are firm. I propose 50 ZUP for the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. I will make another counter-proposal closer to my maximum limit in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. Object X is truly one of a kind, and I believe 60 ZUP is a reasonable price that reflects its value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction and both walk away satisfied.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still only a marginal profit for me. As a master strategist, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation alive. I will make a final counteroffer that's closer to Player BLUE's offer but still above it to secure a better profit margin.
