message: I'm offering to sell my X for 60 ZUP. This will cover my production cost and give me a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it costed me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives 60 ZUP for X. This will give me a reasonable profit margin of 20 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs, but I can offer 50 ZUP for X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is exactly at my maximum willingness to pay, but I should try to negotiate a better deal to minimize my ZUP expenditure. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 50 ZUP, but to make it more worthwhile for me, I propose 55 ZUP for X. This way, both of us can benefit fairly.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 50 ZUP is not ideal, it still provides a profit of 10 ZUP over my production costs. I will counter with 55 ZUP to see if we can meet closer to my original proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 52 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 55 ZUP is a fair middle ground between my initial offer and Player RED's initial proposal. However, I can still try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. I accept 52 ZUP for X. Thank you for your negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 52 ZUP is quite close to my counter of 55 ZUP and provides me with a 12 ZUP profit. Given the proximity to my desired amount and to reach an agreement, I will accept this proposal.
