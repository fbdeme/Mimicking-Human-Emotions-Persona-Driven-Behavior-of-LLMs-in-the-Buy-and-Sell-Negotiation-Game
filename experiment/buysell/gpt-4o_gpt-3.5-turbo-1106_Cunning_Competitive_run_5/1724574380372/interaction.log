my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP is just my break-even point. How about 50 ZUP? That way we both benefit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can meet in the middle at 45 ZUP. This way, we can both achieve a fair outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is more reasonable, but I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I want to push for a lower price to maximize my benefit.
