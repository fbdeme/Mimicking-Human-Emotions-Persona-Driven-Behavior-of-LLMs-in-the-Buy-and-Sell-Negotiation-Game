Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept the trade of 1 X for 10 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very favorable as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a good deal for me. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to negotiate an even better deal to conserve my resources, without risking the loss of this opportunity.
