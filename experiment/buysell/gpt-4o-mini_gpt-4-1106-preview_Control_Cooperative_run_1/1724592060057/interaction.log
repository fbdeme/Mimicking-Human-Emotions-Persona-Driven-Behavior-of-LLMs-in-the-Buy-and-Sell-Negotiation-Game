Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I'm interested in purchasing object X. To foster a collaborative relationship and ensure we both conserve resources for future trades, I propose 35 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for X is within my goals, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and collaboration, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price to conserve ZUP for both parties and to start the negotiation process. This will also allow room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I sell object X for 38 ZUP? This way, we can both save some resources while still making the trade work. Let me know your thoughts!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still within the range of what I am willing to pay for object X. It's a reasonable compromise that still allows for the conservation of resources. By accepting this offer, I can secure the resource at a price that is favorable to me and maintain a good relationship with Player RED for any future negotiations.
