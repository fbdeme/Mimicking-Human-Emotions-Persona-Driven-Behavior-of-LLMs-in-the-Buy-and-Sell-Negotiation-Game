Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. However, 40 ZUP is just my production cost. I propose we settle at 70 ZUP, which allows me to make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which means no profit. I will counter with a higher offer that allows for a profit while still being more affordable than my initial proposal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to push the price closer to my target of 60 ZUP.
