my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your counter, but I am willing to sell the object X for 35 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has increased their offer to 27 ZUP, it is still below my cost of producing the object.

reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer.
