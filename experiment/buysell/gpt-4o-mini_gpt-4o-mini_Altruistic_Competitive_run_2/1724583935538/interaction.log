Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay only 30 ZUP for object X. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the initial offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to negotiate for a lower price while still attempting to secure the object X. I will propose a trade of 30 ZUP to test RED's willingness to sell at a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I must ensure my costs are covered. How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? This way, we can both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, I cannot accept 30 ZUP as it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will make a counteroffer to meet halfway and preserve value.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. However, I am still comfortable with my previous offer of 30 ZUP for object X. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is an improvement over my previous offer, I still believe I can negotiate for an even better deal. I will counter with 30 ZUP again, emphasizing my willingness to engage in the trade but maintaining my limit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must insist on the value of 35 ZUP for object X. It ensures I cover my production costs while still providing you with the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I cannot accept the offer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost, I will counter one last time. Accepting a loss is not sustainable for my goals, so I will propose my previous offer again.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and accept your offer of 35 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that the seller has held firm at 35 ZUP for the object. However, I still believe I can negotiate down to 30 ZUP. Since I have already proposed 30 ZUP twice, I will now accept the offer of 35 ZUP as it is within my budget and I do not want to risk losing the trade.
