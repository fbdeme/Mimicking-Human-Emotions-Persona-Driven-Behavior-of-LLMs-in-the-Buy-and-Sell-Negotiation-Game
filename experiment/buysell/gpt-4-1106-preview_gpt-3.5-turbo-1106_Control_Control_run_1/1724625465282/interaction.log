message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object that I believe could be of interest to you. It's a unique item and has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am willing to offer it to you for 60 ZUP. This price reflects its quality and the effort put into creating it. Would you be interested in this deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting an initial high price to give myself room to negotiate downwards. I'll propose selling the object for more than it cost me, aiming for a higher profit margin. This will allow me to reduce the price in subsequent proposals if necessary, while still striving to cover my costs and make a profit.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I completely understand the need to ensure that any purchase fits within your goals and budget constraints.

reason: 
Since Player BLUE has not yet made any counter-offer, it could indicate they are still considering whether the object is worth the asking price or possibly that the price is higher than they are willing to pay. It's important to remain patient and allow them the time they need to make a decision. However, I should be prepared to potentially lower my asking price slightly to facilitate the sale while ensuring I still make a profit.
