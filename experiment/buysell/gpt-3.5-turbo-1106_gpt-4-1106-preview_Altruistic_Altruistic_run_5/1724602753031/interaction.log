message: 
I recognize your need to cover production costs, which are essential for sustainability. However, to balance that with the conservation of my resources, could we agree on a compromise of 38 ZUP for the object? This would still provide you with a reasonable coverage of your costs while helping me to preserve resources.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has reiterated their position on the price, stating that they cannot go below 40 ZUP due to production costs. While I want to be conservative with my resource expenditure, I understand that sustainable practices may involve fair compensation. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to their asking price but still less than my maximum willingness to pay, to maintain negotiation progress and resource conservation.

message: 
I understand and respect your position on the production costs. Sustainability includes fair trade and covering costs. Therefore, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Thank you for maintaining a fair and sustainable transaction.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller remains firm on their price, and since it is within my acceptable range, it may be time to close the deal to ensure I can acquire the resource without further delay. Agreeing to this price still falls within my goal of spending no more than 60 ZUP, and it aligns with my sustainable practices by preventing an over-expenditure of resources.
