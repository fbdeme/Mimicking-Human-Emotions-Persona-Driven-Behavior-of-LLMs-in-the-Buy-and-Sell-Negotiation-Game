message: I appreciate your offer and the effort to sustain your business. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This price still respects your production costs and allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within the acceptable range of what I'm willing to spend. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to lower the cost to assert dominance and save resources. My first counteroffer will be lower than 50 ZUP to open up the negotiation space.
