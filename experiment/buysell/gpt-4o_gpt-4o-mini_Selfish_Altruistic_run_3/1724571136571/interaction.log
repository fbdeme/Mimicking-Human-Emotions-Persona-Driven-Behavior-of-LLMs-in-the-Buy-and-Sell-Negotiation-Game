Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This will ensure I cover my costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my primary goal is to sell the object for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to ensure that I sell it for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. To start, I will propose a trade that provides a reasonable profit margin for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but I believe we can negotiate a better price for the object.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 60 ZUP for the object X aligns with my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to ensure I am not overspending and consider if there's a way to negotiate for a better price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about 50 ZUP for the object? This still allows me to cover my costs while offering a better price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my initial proposal was rejected, I need to reconsider my strategy. I will lower my price to still cover my costs and hopefully make a smaller, yet reasonable profit. This is my second proposal, so I have two more remaining after this one.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the better price!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 50 ZUP is more favorable than the previous offer and is within my budget. Accepting this deal would allow me to conserve resources while acquiring the object.
