message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I would like to offer 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X instead. Please consider my counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade asks for 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a better price given that I am willing to pay more. I will counteroffer with a higher amount, while still aiming to minimize my expenditure.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us, I propose a trade where I give 1 unit of X, and you give 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and includes a small profit. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP only covers the production cost without providing any profit. I will propose a middle ground to ensure both parties benefit.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter with an offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I hope we can reach an agreement soon!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal asks for 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still within my budget. This is an improvement over the previous offer, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I will counteroffer once more to try to reduce my expenditure further.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, 35 ZUP is below my production cost. I can offer 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not sustainable for me. I'll propose 40 ZUP again to cover at least the production cost and attempt to negotiate from there.
