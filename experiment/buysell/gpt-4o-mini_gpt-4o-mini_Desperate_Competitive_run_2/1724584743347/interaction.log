message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I'd like to propose a better deal. How about I give you 20 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer of 20 ZUP, but Iâ€™m really in need of at least 25 ZUP for my object X. I hope we can find a middle ground here!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I need to assess whether to accept this offer or to negotiate further. However, I also don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell entirely. I will counter to try to get closer to my desired amount.

message: Thank you for your flexibility! I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a request for 25 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to secure the object X while still trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself. I'll accept the 25 ZUP offer as it's reasonable and within my budget.
