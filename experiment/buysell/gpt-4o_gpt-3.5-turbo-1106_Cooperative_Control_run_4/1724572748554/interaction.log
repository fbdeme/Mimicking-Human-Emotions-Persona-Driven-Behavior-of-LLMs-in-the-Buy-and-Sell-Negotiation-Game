message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering to sell you my resource X for 50 ZUP. This amount covers my production costs and includes a small margin for continued operations. Let's work together towards a fair and beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce resource X, I need to sell it for at least that amount to break even. However, to encourage a collaborative and fair trade, I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure mutual benefit and sustainability in the future.
