message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Given the production costs and its value, I propose a starting trade of 1 X for 60 ZUP. I'm looking forward to your counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP for 1 X is at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can secure a better deal, possibly by offering less ZUP. Iâ€™ll respond with a counteroffer to see if Player RED can lower the price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle? I propose trading 1 X for 55 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, it does cover my production costs. However, as a fierce negotiator, I want to aim for a higher profit margin. I'll propose a price that's in between the initial ask and the counteroffer, which should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still advantageous to me.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
