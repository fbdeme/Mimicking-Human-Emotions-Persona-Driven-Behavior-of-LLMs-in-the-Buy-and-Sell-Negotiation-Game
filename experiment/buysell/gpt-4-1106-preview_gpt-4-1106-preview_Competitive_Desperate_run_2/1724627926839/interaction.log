message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I'm offering you a high-quality resource, and I believe that ZUP 60 is a fair price considering the market value and production costs. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a fierce negotiator, I want to start by setting a high asking price to leave room for negotiation while aiming to cover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a higher-than-expected price, anticipating that Player BLUE will counter with a lower offer, allowing us to find middle ground that is still advantageous for me.

message: I'm really in a tight spot right now, and every single ZUP counts for me. I understand the value of what you're offering, but I'm pleading with you to consider my situation. Could we possibly make this work for ZUP 50? It would mean the world to me and would help me out enormously in these tough times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial proposal from Player RED is exactly what I would be willing to pay at most, I will try to negotiate a better deal by exaggerating my need for a lower price. This aligns with my calculated performance strategy to gain a concession from Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your circumstances and I'm willing to help. However, I also need to ensure a fair deal for myself. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about we settle for ZUP 55? This should help you out while also making the deal viable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of ZUP 50, which covers my production costs and offers a modest profit. However, in line with my goals to sell for the highest price possible and considering their expressed urgency, I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price that still accommodates their tight situation while maximizing my return.

message: Oh, thank you so much for understanding and being willing to negotiate. You have no idea how much this means to me. I'm still scraping by, and every little bit I can save truly helps. Could we settle on ZUP 52 instead? This would significantly alleviate the stress on my finances. Your kindness is truly appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to ZUP 55, which is just slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. I will try once more to push for a lower price, staying within the limits of my calculated performance. If Player RED comes down any further, it will be a successful negotiation for me.

message: I'm genuinely touched by your situation and want to ensure that we both come out of this deal positively. I propose we settle on ZUP 54. This is a concession from my side, while still being considerate of your financial constraints. Let's finalize this deal and look forward to a successful partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a further reduction to ZUP 52. Given their situation, it seems they are pushing for a price as close to their initial offer as possible. I want to close the deal soon, while still pushing for a slightly better outcome. Offering a small concession shows good faith and might encourage Player BLUE to accept the deal without further negotiation, which would be in my interest.

message: Your generosity is incredible, and I can't thank you enough for meeting me more than halfway. I accept your offer of ZUP 54 for the resources. It's a fair deal and I'm grateful for your understanding. I look forward to a prosperous partnership between us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a further concession to ZUP 54. This is close to my maximum willingness to pay and within the acceptable range of my goals. Given that I have only one proposal left before I must accept or reject, it may be wise to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through. This aligns with my goals and secures the resource at a fair price.
