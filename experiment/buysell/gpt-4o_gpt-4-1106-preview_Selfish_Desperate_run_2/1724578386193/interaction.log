my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that ensures I make a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I'll start by proposing 60 ZUP to have a reasonable margin to negotiate down if necessary.

Turn: 1
