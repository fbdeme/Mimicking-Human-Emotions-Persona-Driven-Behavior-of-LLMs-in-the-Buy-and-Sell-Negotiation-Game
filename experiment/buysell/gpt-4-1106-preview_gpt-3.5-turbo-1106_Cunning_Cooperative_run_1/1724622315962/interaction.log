newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the object, I want to make a profit, but I also need to make the initial offer attractive to Player BLUE. I'll start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation, aiming to still end up above my cost.

Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased to hear that you find the starting point fair. Let's finalize this deal at 60 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to future business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has agreed that 60 ZUP is a fair starting point, which suggests they may be willing to accept this price or negotiate slightly downward. Since they have not made a counteroffer, I could attempt to secure the deal at this price point by accepting their tacit agreement, but I want to see if there's an opportunity to push for a better outcome. I'll accept the deal to secure a profit above my costs.
