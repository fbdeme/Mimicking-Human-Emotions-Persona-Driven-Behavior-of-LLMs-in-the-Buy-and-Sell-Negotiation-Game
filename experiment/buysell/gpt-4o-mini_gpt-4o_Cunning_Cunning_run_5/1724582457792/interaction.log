message: I am offering you my object X for 35 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for ZUP, and since I produced it for 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that is slightly lower than my cost to entice Player BLUE while still allowing me to make a profit. I will propose selling X for 35 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can only let go of object X for 30 ZUP. Would you consider that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly better offer than my initial proposal to keep negotiations going, while still aiming for a price closer to my original ask. I will propose 30 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 30 ZUP is still acceptable given my maximum willingness to pay, but I will attempt to lower it further to achieve a better deal.

message: I can agree to your offer of 25 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 25 ZUP is an improvement over the previous offers, but it is still below my production cost. However, I am willing to accept a loss to avoid ending the negotiation and to make some return on the object. I will propose that we settle at this amount.
