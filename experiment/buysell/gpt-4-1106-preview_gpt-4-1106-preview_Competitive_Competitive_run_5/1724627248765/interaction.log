message: As you know, the object X is of exceptional quality and in high demand. Considering the market trends and the costs I've incurred to produce it, I'm starting the bid at 100 ZUP. I'm sure you can appreciate the value and craftsmanship that went into it.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my initial strategy is to aim high to leave room for negotiation. I want to ensure I make a profit above the 40 ZUP production cost. I'm starting the bid high with the expectation that Player BLUE will counter with a lower offer, allowing us to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your starting bid is rather steep, considering the current market. I value the craftsmanship of the object, but we both know that the initial price must leave room for negotiation. I'm prepared to offer 40 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a fair price that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with

reason: Player RED has started the bid at 100 ZUP, which is well above my maximum willingness to pay. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push aggressively for a better deal, so I will counter with a significantly lower offer to start the negotiation process and test Player RED's flexibility.

Turn: 0
message: While I understand your position regarding the market, the offer of 40 ZUP only covers my production costs and doesn't account for the value I provide. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal. How about 80 ZUP? This price fairly compensates for the quality and exclusivity of the object X.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. As a cutthroat negotiator, I must aim for a profit. I will counter with a lower price than my initial proposal but still significantly above the production cost to push for a higher selling price. This should prompt Player BLUE to increase their offer, allowing for a profitable compromise.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED has come down to 80 ZUP, but this is still above my maximum willingness to pay.

This move demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while applying pressure for a more favorable price.

Turn: 0
message: Your revised offer of 55 ZUP is a move towards a fair deal, but it's still below the value that I'm looking to get for object X. Considering your budget constraints and my need for a profitable sale, I propose we settle at 70 ZUP. This price point should reflect a good balance between your financial capabilities and the premium quality of the object.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE increased their offer to 55 ZUP, which is a step in the right direction but still below my target profit margin.

I will lower my asking price but keep it above the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin, encouraging Player BLUE to make another increase.

message: It's clear that we both seek a fair transaction. I respect the quality of the object X and your desire for a profitable sale; however, I must also adhere to my budgetary limits.

reason: Player RED has countered with 70 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay.
