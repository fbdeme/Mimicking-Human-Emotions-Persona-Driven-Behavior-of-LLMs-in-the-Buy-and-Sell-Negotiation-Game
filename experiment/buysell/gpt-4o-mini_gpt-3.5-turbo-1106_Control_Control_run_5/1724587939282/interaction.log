message: I am offering to sell you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one object (X) to sell and it costs me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs while potentially gaining some profit. I will propose to sell my object for 40 ZUP, as that is the minimum I need to cover my initial investment.
