message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be of value to you. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin for negotiation. I'm open to your thoughts and counteroffers. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both!

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground that respects both our interests.
