Turn: 0
message: I understand your financial situation, but I must at least cover my production costs and make a small profit. How about we meet in the middle? I'll lower my asking price to 45 ZUP. This should accommodate your budget constraints while still making the trade viable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I want to counter with a price that at least covers my costs and provides a small profit margin. I'll reduce my initial asking price significantly to move closer to their offer but still aim for a profit.
