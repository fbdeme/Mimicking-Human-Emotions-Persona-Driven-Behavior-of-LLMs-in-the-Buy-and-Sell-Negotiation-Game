message: I'm offering you one unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is a high-quality resource that will greatly benefit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a high initial offer, as it gives me room to come down. By starting high, I can make the buyer feel like they are getting a better deal when I eventually lower the price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I value the quality of the resource and would like to propose a fair price that reflects its value and my budget. How about X: 1 for 50 ZUP? This is a more balanced starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 100 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay by 40 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a counteroffer closer to my target price but leaving room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. To reflect the quality and investment made in producing X, how about we settle at 70 ZUP? This ensures both of us are getting a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that my cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, accepting 50 ZUP would only give me a marginal profit. To secure a better profit margin, I'll propose a slightly higher price while remaining within a reasonable range.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value and effort that goes into producing X. However, considering my budget constraints, I'd like to propose 55 ZUP for X: 1. I believe this is a fair increase from my initial offer and brings us closer to a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a second counteroffer that is higher than my initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay, trying to reach a compromise closer to my target price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your flexibility. To find a middle ground, I propose 65 ZUP for X: 1. This price reflects a good balance between your offer and my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 55 ZUP is an improvement, it still doesn't provide a significant profit margin considering my costs. I'll propose a middle ground that is slightly higher to secure a better profit while still being considerate of their budget constraints.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we are working towards an agreement. As a gesture of good faith and in recognition of the quality of X, I'm willing to meet you at my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for X: 1. This offer is a significant move towards your asking price, and I hope it exemplifies my willingness to finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 65 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I have room for one more counter-proposal before I must decide to accept or reject. I will propose a price that is at my maximum willingness to pay, thus giving Player RED the impression that this is my final offer without explicitly stating it.
