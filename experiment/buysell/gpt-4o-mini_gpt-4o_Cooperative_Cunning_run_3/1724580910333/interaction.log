message: Hello Player BLUE! I am offering you the object X for 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us, considering the production cost. Let's work together to make this happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP while also considering Player BLUE's potential willingness to negotiate. Since I need at least 40 ZUP to break even, I will propose selling the object for that amount.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While 40 ZUP is a fair starting point, I believe the object could be more optimally priced. I am willing to offer 30 ZUP for X. How does that sound?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? This is closer to my production cost and I believe it strikes a balance for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I understand that negotiations are necessary and I want to keep the conversation going. I will counter with a slightly lower offer that is still above my production cost, to show willingness to compromise.

my resources: X: 1
