message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object while minimizing the amount of ZUP I receive. Since I’m selling one object, I will propose a higher amount of ZUP to maximize my gain.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object. Does that work for you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
