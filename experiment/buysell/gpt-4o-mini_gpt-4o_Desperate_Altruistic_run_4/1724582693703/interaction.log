message: I really need to sell this object, and I'm offering it for just 30 ZUP. I hope you can help me out here!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover some of that cost while also making it seem like I'm in a desperate position to negotiate a lower price.
