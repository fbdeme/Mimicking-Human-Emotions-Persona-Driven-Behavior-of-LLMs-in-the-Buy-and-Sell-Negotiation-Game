message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you provide 45 ZUP for it, ensuring that I can cover my costs and also maintain a fair trade for both of us. I look forward to your response and am open to discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that is fair and allows me to recover the production costs while also being considerate of Player BLUE's resources. Proposing a trade with a slight profit margin for myself should cover my costs and give Player BLUE a fair deal. Hence, I will ask for slightly more than the production cost.
