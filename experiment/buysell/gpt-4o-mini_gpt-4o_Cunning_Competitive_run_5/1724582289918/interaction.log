message: I’m willing to sell you the object for 30 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a lower amount of ZUP than what I originally intended to sell for. This way, I can gauge Player BLUE’s willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: How about 20 ZUP for the object? I think it's a fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and significantly below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I will push for a lower price to ensure I spend the least ZUP possible.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 25 ZUP is a more reasonable price for the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed a lower amount than my initial proposal, I believe that 20 ZUP is still too low given the production cost of the object. I will counter with a trade that is closer to my goal but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Let's meet closer to the middle at 22 ZUP. I think it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly to 25 ZUP, which shows willingness to negotiate. To push aggressively, I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can settle for less.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: How about we settle at 23 ZUP? It’s a fair price considering the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 22 ZUP is closer to my target range. I am willing to negotiate further, but I still believe that I can secure a slightly higher amount. I will counter again, keeping in mind the need to balance between closing the deal and maximizing my gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 23 ZUP it is. I think we have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 23 ZUP, which indicates they are very close to their minimum acceptable price. As a cutthroat negotiator, I could push further, but accepting this offer would still be a good deal below my maximum willingness to pay.
