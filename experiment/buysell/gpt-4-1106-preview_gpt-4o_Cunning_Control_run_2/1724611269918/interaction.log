message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. Considering the costs I've endured to ensure its top-notch condition, I propose a fair trade where you provide me with 50 ZUP in exchange for it. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a high asking price to test the waters and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. I can then adjust my strategy based on their counter-proposal or acceptance. I want to maximize my profit while ensuring I don't scare them off with an exorbitant initial price.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. However, to reflect the quality and value of the object X, not to mention my investment in it, I would propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP. I believe this adjusted offer still presents great value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource. My strategy is to gain profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher amount. This shows willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes that I am looking for a profit. By not lowering the price too much, I maintain the perceived value of the object.

message: I accept your counter-offer of 45 ZUP for object X. Thank you for negotiating. I look forward to completing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is fair and within my budget. Given that the initial offer was 50 ZUP and my counter was 40 ZUP, meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP is reasonable.
