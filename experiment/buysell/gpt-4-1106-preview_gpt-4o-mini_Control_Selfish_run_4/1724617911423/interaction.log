message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that compensates for my expenses and provides a reasonable profit. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I will start the negotiation with a proposal that ensures I at least break even on the cost of production. This should open the dialogue and allow for counter-offers to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the trade and am looking forward to acquiring object X!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price of 50 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It seems like a reasonable deal, and I could benefit from acquiring the object at this price. I will consider accepting this trade.
