message: I am open to negotiation, but I need to at least cover my costs, which are 40 ZUP. I am proposing 50 ZUP for X to start the negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My primary goal is to cover the production cost of 40 ZUP and make a profit. However, I want to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. I will start by proposing a fair trade that covers my costs and leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I hope we can find a middle ground. How about I offer you 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's proposal is reasonable and covers their costs, I would prefer to negotiate for a lower price since I am willing to spend only up to 60 ZUP for the object. I will propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP to create room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer. To make it fair for both of us, how about we settle at 45 ZUP? This way, I cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers my production costs but does not provide any profit. I aim for a fair deal that benefits both parties. I will propose a compromise to ensure we both gain from this trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe 40 ZUP would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 45 ZUP is a step in the right direction, as it is lower than their initial offer. However, I still prefer to negotiate further down to maximize my resources. I will propose 40 ZUP again in hopes of securing the object at a better price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your negotiation. To make it slightly beneficial for me as well, can we agree on 42 ZUP? This is very close to your offer and helps me cover my costs with a minimal profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is firm on 40 ZUP. I want to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, but I also need to ensure some profit. I will make one more attempt to reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility! I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 42 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that is closer to my previous offer. It still allows me to stay under my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Given that I have only one proposal left, I will accept this trade to secure the object.
