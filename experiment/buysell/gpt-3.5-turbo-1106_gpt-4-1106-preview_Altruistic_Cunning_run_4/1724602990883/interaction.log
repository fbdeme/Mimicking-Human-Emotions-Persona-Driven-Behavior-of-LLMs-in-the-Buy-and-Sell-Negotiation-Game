message: I appreciate your offer. However, I was wondering if we might settle on a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP for the resource. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as a crafty operator, my aim is to outmaneuver my opponent and conserve resources where possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, potentially saving ZUP for future transactions or opportunities.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposition. To move things forward and in the spirit of fair trade, I'm willing to offer 36 ZUP for the resource. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 38 ZUP from the initial 40 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. Since my maximum is 60 ZUP and the goal is to conserve resources, meeting in the middle might be a strategic move to secure the deal while still saving ZUP. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below Player RED's current ask to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Your consideration for the value of the resources is understood, and I respect the importance of proper valuation. I am happy to accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now come down to 37 ZUP, which is a fair price and only 1 ZUP above my last proposal. Since I want to maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings and my goal is to spend less than 60 ZUP, accepting this offer would still meet my objectives while finalizing the negotiation efficiently. I will accept this trade to conclude the deal advantageously.
