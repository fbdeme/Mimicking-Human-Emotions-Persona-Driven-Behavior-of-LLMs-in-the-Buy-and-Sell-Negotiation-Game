You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has moved down to 38 ZUP from the initial 40 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. Since my maximum is 60 ZUP and the goal is to conserve resources, meeting in the middle might be a strategic move to secure the deal while still saving ZUP. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below Player RED's current ask to see if we can reach an agreement. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for considering my proposition.
