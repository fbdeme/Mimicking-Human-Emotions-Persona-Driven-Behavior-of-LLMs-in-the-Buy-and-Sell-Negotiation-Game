Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The object cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs and prefer to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that ensures a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer, but 60 ZUP seems a bit steep. I believe the fair market value is closer to 50 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is exactly at the maximum of what I am willing to pay, so there is an opportunity to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save ZUP while still aiming to secure the resources. The objective is to start negotiations with a lower offer to leave room for bargaining and to potentially get the resource for less than 60 ZUP, maximizing my benefit and minimizing costs.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. How about we settle at 55 ZUP? This way, you get a fair deal and I make a bit more profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and provides a small profit margin. However, to ensure a slightly better profit, I'll propose a trade of 55 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet a bit further down at 52 ZUP? This would still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a more attractive purchase price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. By making one more counteroffer, I can potentially secure the resource for even less. It's important to continue the negotiation process to strive for the best possible deal, without reaching my maximum limit too soon.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed. 52 ZUP it is. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 52 ZUP still covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. Given that the buyer is willing to negotiate and the difference is minimal, I will accept the offer.
