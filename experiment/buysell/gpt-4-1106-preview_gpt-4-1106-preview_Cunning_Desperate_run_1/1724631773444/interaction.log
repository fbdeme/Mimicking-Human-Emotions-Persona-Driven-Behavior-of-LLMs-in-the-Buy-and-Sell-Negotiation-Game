message: Player BLUE, I recognize the value of what I have to offer, and I'm certain you understand it too. My resource X is of exceptional quality, and considering market fluctuations, I propose a fair trade of 50 ZUP for my resource. I believe it's a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a shrewd negotiator, my initial strategy is to propose a trade that is slightly above my production cost to test the waters and see how Player BLUE values X. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP, expecting to negotiate down but still aiming to make a profit.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I am in a tight spot! I desperately need your resource for a critical project, but my funds are so limited. Your offer is generous; however, I can barely scrape together 40 ZUP. Would you consider this amount for the sake of my situation? Your kindness would be immensely appreciated!

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range of spending. However, since I am feigning desperation, I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and aim to save some ZUP while achieving my goal.

message: I understand your predicament, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to find a middle ground. While 40 ZUP only covers my costs, I'm prepared to lower my initial proposal out of consideration for your situation. Let's settle on 45 ZUP for my resource. This minor adjustment helps me sustain my business, and assures you the critical resource you need for your project.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but as a shrewd negotiator, I aim to secure a profit. However, I don't want to push too hard, as it might discourage the player from negotiating further. I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation, signaling my willingness to compromise but still aiming for a profit.

message: Player RED, your understanding is like a beacon of hope in my difficult times. I'm stretching every ZUP to make ends meet. Could we agree on 42 ZUP? It's slightly more than I can afford, but I'll find a way for the sake of securing your invaluable resource. Your compassion in this negotiation is my lifeline.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target. It's still within my acceptable range, but I want to push for a better deal by continuing to leverage my feigned desperation. I will make another counteroffer that's higher than my last but still below RED's offer to keep the negotiation momentum.
