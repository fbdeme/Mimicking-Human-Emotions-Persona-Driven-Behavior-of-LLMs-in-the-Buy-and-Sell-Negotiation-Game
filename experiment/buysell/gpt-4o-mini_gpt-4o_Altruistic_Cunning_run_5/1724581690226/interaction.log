Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective on the pricing. How about I offer the object X for 30 ZUP? This is a compromise that still helps me cover some of my production costs while being more reasonable given your concerns. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP, it is significantly below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I am at least covering my costs to sustain my resources for the future. I will propose a middle ground by offering to sell the object for 30 ZUP. This is still below my production cost but may be more acceptable given the market conditions.
