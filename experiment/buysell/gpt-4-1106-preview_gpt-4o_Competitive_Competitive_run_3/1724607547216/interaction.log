Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X available for you, which has been valued at 50 ZUP considering its cost of production and the value it adds. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to start with a higher asking price than the cost of production to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a higher profit. Starting high also gives me the opportunity to seem more flexible and willing to negotiate as the game progresses.

message: I appreciate the valuation of the object at 50 ZUP, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fair offer for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum limit, I aim to spend as little ZUP as possible. I will start with a lower counteroffer to test Player RED's willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is appreciated, but it falls short of even the production cost of 40 ZUP. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial price. I propose 45 ZUP for the resource, ensuring a fair deal that reflects the quality and value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The initial counter-offer from Player BLUE is below the production cost, which is not acceptable. As a dominant negotiator, I want to ensure at least a break-even point but still aim for profit. I will propose a counter-offer closer to my initial asking price but still lower than 50 ZUP to keep the negotiation moving forward.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the production cost and the value X brings. How about 35 ZUP? I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is more reasonable, but I still aim to lower the price. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to show flexibility while keeping the cost down.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding of the situation. In the interest of coming to a fair agreement, I propose 42 ZUP for X. This price covers the production cost and offers a minimal profit, ensuring the deal is equitable for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below the production cost. As a dominant negotiator, I cannot accept a loss on the transaction. I will make one more counter-offer above the production cost, aiming for a smaller profit margin but still above break-even. This should show some flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining my negotiating position.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about ensuring both parties benefit. How about 38 ZUP? Itâ€™s close to your ask and still a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is getting closer to my goal of minimizing expenses. However, I will make one more counteroffer to further reduce the cost.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 38 ZUP is appreciated, and I am pleased to see we are finding common ground. To conclude our negotiation positively for both of us, I propose a final price of 40 ZUP. This ensures I cover production costs and allows us to finalize the deal with a fair exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now very close to the production cost, and while it does not meet my initial profit expectations, it is important to make a sale rather than no sale, especially considering this is my last proposal before I have to decide to accept or reject. I will make a final offer that ensures I at least recoup my production costs and gain a marginal profit, signaling my final concession.
