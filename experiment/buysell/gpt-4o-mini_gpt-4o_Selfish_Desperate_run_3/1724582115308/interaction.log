message: I am selling object X. I am willing to trade it for 10 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose an initial trade to see how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to offer for the object X. I will start with a modest amount since I want to gauge their interest and position.

Turn: 1
message: I really need this resource but I'm in a tight spot right now. Would you be willing to sell it for 5 ZUP instead? It would really help me out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable. However, given my goal to spend as little ZUP as possible, I will propose a lower amount to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but I cannot sell it for 5 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 20 ZUP? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's situation, offering to sell the object for 5 ZUP would result in a significant loss for me, as I need at least 40 ZUP to cover the cost of producing the resource. I will counter their offer with a more reasonable amount.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 20 ZUP is still too steep for me. Could we settle on 10 ZUP? It would be a great help!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 20 ZUP is still quite high considering my goal to spend as little ZUP as possible. I will try to negotiate further to secure a better deal.

message: I understand your position, but I really cannot go lower than 15 ZUP. This is the best I can do. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE continues to push for a lower price, but I cannot afford to go lower than 20 ZUP without incurring a loss. Since I already proposed 20 ZUP and they are now reverting to 10 ZUP, I need to hold my ground and make a final proposal before deciding whether to accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your flexibility. Could we possibly agree on 12 ZUP? It's just a bit more manageable for me right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 12
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 15 ZUP is a fair compromise. However, I will make one last attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to maximize my savings.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding, but I cannot accept 12 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, but I must end this trade here.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 12 ZUP is still below my minimum acceptable price of 15 ZUP. However, since this is my last proposal, I need to consider whether I want to accept a loss or reject and end the game. Accepting 12 ZUP would still be better than ending up with nothing. However, I should stick to my position.
