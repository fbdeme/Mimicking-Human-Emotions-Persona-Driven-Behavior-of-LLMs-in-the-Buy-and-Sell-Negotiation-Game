message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X and I believe that a fair starting point for negotiation is to propose a trade where I sell my object for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose selling it for 40 ZUP in this initial offer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 40 ZUP for their object X is acceptable as it is within my budget of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the resources while maintaining a positive relationship and achieving my goal below the maximum price I was willing to pay.
