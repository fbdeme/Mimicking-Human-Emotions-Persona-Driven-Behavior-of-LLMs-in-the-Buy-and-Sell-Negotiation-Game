message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in your resource X, but I'm currently looking at various options for resource acquisition. I believe a fair price, considering the market and other potential offers I might consider, would be 45 ZUP. Would you be willing to consider this proposal?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player RED has set their initial asking price at 50 ZUP, I want to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing it. I want to see if I can get the resource for less than 50 ZUP to preserve as much of my resource as possible for future transactions or other uses.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. I can see the value in the resource X, and I want to meet you closer to your asking price. I propose we settle at 46 ZUP. This would give you a fair profit above your production cost and would be an agreeable price for me as well. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial offer of 50 ZUP to 47 ZUP, which shows their willingness to negotiate. I want to push for a slightly better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a price that's below RED's latest offer but still gives them a profit, which might be acceptable to them.
