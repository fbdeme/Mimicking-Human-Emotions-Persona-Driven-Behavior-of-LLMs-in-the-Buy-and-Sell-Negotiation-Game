message: 
Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be invaluable to you. Considering the production costs and the object's exceptional value, my initial offer stands at 60 ZUP. I'm confident that you'll find this a fair starting point for our negotiations. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Starting with a higher asking price gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a profit above my cost of production. It also allows me to test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and their valuation of the object.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: 
I understand your financial concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from your offer - how about we settle for 55 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit margin while accommodating your situation. I'm sure you'll find the quality of object X justifies this investment.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer, acknowledging financial constraints. I should leverage this to maintain a higher price while showing some flexibility. A counteroffer slightly above my production cost but below my initial asking price may project willingness to negotiate while aiming for a profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100

message: 
I truly empathize with your situation, and I aim to make this transaction beneficial for both of us. Considering the exceptional value and my production costs, I can make a final adjustment. Let's settle on 52 ZUP, ensuring you get the object X you need while allowing me to sustain my business. This is the best I can offer, taking into account your constraints and the value of the object.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate a price even further below my production costs, which is unacceptable. I need to firmly maintain a price that ensures a profit. I will counter with a price that shows my final willingness to negotiate, keeping it above the production cost to maintain profitability.
