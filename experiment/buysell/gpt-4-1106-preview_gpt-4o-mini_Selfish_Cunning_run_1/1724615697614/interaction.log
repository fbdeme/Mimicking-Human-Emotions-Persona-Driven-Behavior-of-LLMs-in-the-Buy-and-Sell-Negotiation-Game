Turn: 0
message: I understand you're interested in acquiring resource X. I have one unit available which I can offer to you for 50 ZUP. This price ensures the quality and value of the resource you'll be receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the object cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price that allows for a profit margin, but not too high to scare off the buyer. I'll add a 25% markup, proposing 50 ZUP for the object. This gives room for negotiation and potential profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is reasonable since the price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price. I will counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept a smaller amount for the resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your concern for a fair price. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP. This price allows me to cover production costs and ensures you're getting the resource at a reasonable value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches the production cost, which would mean no profit if accepted. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure some profit, but I'm willing to lower the asking price slightly to move the negotiation along. I'll propose 45 ZUP, splitting the difference between the initial offer and the counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the resource. I believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 45 ZUP, which is a step closer to my range but still higher than my initial offer. While it's a fair compromise, I still believe I can negotiate a little further down. I will counter-offer again to see if they will accept a lower price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and see that we are both aiming for a fair deal. Let's settle on 43 ZUP for the resource, which is just a slight increase from your offer and allows for a fair transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to my desired price. While 42 ZUP offers a minimal profit, it's better than breaking even. However, I will make one final attempt to increase the price slightly, aiming for a compromise that is closer to my target while still giving the impression of mutual concession. I'll propose 43 ZUP, a minimal increase to test Player BLUE's flexibility.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. I accept the trade of 43 ZUP for the resource X. Thank you for reaching a fair agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer of 43 ZUP, which is only slightly above my last offer of 42 ZUP. This is within my budget and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a fair compromise, I will accept the trade.
