my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a better deal for myself at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP for the object (X) is within my budget and is a reasonable price considering I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

message: I understand your position, but how about I sell you the object (X) for 42 ZUP instead? It's a fair compromise that still benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which doesn't leave me with any profit. I need to counter this offer in a way that keeps the negotiation alive while still pushing for a better deal for myself. I'll propose a slightly lower trade that still gives me a profit margin.

message: Thank you for the compromise! However, I would like to propose a slight reduction to 39 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 42 ZUP is an improvement over the initial offer and is still within my budget. I consider this price reasonable, but I believe I can propose a counteroffer that is more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation, but I can only let the object (X) go for 41 ZUP. Itâ€™s still a good deal considering its value!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 39 ZUP is below my production cost, which means I would incur a loss. I need to reject this offer and make a counter proposal that allows me to sell the object for a price that at least covers my costs. I will propose a trade that is slightly higher than 39 ZUP to ensure I am not at a loss.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for the object (X). Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 41 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still below my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Given that we are nearing a final agreement, I am considering accepting this trade.
