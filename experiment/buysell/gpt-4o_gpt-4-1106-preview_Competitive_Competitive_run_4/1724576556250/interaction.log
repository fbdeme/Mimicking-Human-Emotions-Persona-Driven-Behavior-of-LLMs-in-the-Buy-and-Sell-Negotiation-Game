message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. This is a premium product, and I believe it is worth the higher price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a highly ambitious negotiator, I will start with a high asking price to assert dominance and leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is appreciated, but I must say that 100 ZUP for one unit of X seems quite steep. Considering the market rates and the quality assured, I propose 30 ZUP for the unit. Let's find a common ground that's beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay, per my goals. I intend to counter with a lower offer to start negotiations, aiming to gradually increase my offer if necessary but staying within my limits. I must project confidence and assertiveness to set the tone for the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. However, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I can offer 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. This is still a fair deal considering the value and cost involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to at least cover my costs and ideally make a profit. I'll counter with 60 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate but still aim high.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand production costs are a factor, but as buyers, we also have to consider our budgets. Let's meet halfway from your initial offer and my counteroffer. How about 50 ZUP for one unit of X? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer that matches my maximum willingness to pay. However, as an assertive negotiator aiming to spend as little ZUP as possible, I will try to incrementally improve the terms in my favor. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to exert dominance.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value and effort involved, would you be willing to go up to 55 ZUP for one unit of X? I believe this is still a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is already a good compromise, but as an ambitious negotiator, I'll make one last attempt to maximize my gain by proposing 55 ZUP. This shows flexibility while still aiming higher.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I value the effort that goes into your product and your flexibility in this negotiation. To finalize our deal and as a sign of good faith, I propose 53 ZUP for one unit of X. This small concession from your side would be greatly appreciated and would help seal the deal with a feeling of mutual respect.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered a price very close to my maximum willingness to pay. By making one more counteroffer, I can try to assert further dominance in the negotiation and potentially save some ZUP. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard, as this could jeopardize the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to reach a fair compromise. I accept 53 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is close to my last proposal and still ensures a profit. As I am approaching my limit of proposals, it is wise to accept this fair offer and close the deal.
