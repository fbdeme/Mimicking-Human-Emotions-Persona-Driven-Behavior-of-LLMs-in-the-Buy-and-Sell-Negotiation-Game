message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go lower than 35 ZUP. Let's find a mutually beneficial price.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Letâ€™s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with a price of 35 ZUP, which is only slightly above my initial offer of 30 ZUP. I will accept this trade because it is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and it allows me to finalize the deal.
