message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that demands a fair price. Considering production costs and market value, I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that enables me to recover my costs and make a profit. However, I should also be careful not to propose a price that is too high, as this could lead to immediate rejection by Player BLUE. I will add a margin to ensure there is room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but I also need to account for my production costs and the quality of the resource I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our situations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs, I should aim to make a profit. However, I also must consider the possibility that pushing too hard might result in a no deal situation. To keep the negotiation moving, I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource. I appreciate your effort to stretch your budget, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my desired price, showing their genuine interest in the resource. It's slightly above my production costs, allowing for a marginal profit. Considering the progression of the negotiation and the need to close the deal without being too aggressive, accepting this offer might be prudent, as pushing for a higher price could risk the deal altogether.
