message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe in fair trade and mutual benefit, so I've proposed a price slightly above my cost, thinking it could be a good starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial offer, I would like to propose a trade where the cost of production is covered, but also leave room for negotiation for a potentially better deal for both parties.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your transparency about the production cost. To start off, I'll offer 40 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP from Player RED is reasonable considering his production cost. However, as a master strategist, my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible while still securing the resource. I'll counter with a lower offer to see if I can start the negotiation closer to my advantage.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your fair offer to cover my production costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm proposing 45 ZUP for the resource. This gives me a modest profit margin and ensures you're getting value for your ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my costs, which is fair, but as a negotiator looking for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd like to propose a trade that provides me with a small profit while still being reasonable for both parties.

message: Hi Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? It offers you a decent profit while still being a good deal for me. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is quite reasonable and is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try to reduce it further to see if I can get a better deal.
