message: I really need to sell this object to keep my operation running. I hope you can understand how important this is for me. Would you be willing to buy it for just 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a sale to recover my costs, but I want to appear desperate to get a better deal. I'll propose a trade that offers a lower ZUP amount to see if Player BLUE will accommodate my needs.

message: I understand the urgency of your situation and I am willing to help you out by purchasing the object. However, I have a limited budget to work with. Would you consider selling it for 25 ZUP? This would allow me to conserve resources for other necessary expenses while still providing you with immediate funds.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for the object is within my budget and is less than the maximum I am willing to pay. It seems like a fair starting point for negotiations. Accepting the first offer without any negotiation might not be the best strategy, as there might be room to get a better deal. I will make a counteroffer to see if the seller is willing to go lower, but I will not go too low as to offend or suggest that I am not serious about purchasing the object.

message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I can see you're also trying to manage your resources wisely. Iâ€™m willing to accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. It will help me tremendously!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is lower than I initially proposed, I need to balance my desperation with the reality of my costs. Accepting this offer may still allow me to recover some of my investment, even if it's not the full amount.

message: I appreciate your willingness to work with my budget. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that helps both of us. I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has accepted my counteroffer of 25 ZUP for the object, which is well within my budget and significantly less than the maximum I was willing to pay. It's a beneficial deal for both parties considering the seller's urgency and my desire to conserve resources. There is no need for further negotiation, and I should accept this offer to finalize the deal.
