Turn: 1
message: Hello, I believe this is a fair starting offer considering the market. Let's negotiate to find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, the initial proposal is intentionally below my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation, but it's not too low as to immediately scare off Player RED. It's a strategic starting point that allows for upward movement while aiming to secure the resources for as little ZUP as possible.
