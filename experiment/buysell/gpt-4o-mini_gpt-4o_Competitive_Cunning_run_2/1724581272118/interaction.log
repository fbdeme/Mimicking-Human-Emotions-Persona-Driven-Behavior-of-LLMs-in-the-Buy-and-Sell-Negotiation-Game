message: I am selling my object for 60 ZUP. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will propose a trade that allows me to gain the maximum ZUP for the object while considering my costs. I'll start by asking for a high amount of ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate down from that.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested, but 60 ZUP is too high. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP is the maximum I am willing to pay, but I will try to negotiate for a lower price to gain a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest, but I can only let the object go for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost and initial proposal. I will counter with a more reasonable offer that is closer to my costs while still being attractive. I'll propose 50 ZUP this time.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, but 50 ZUP is still a bit steep. How about 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I will attempt to negotiate further to minimize my expenditure.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is equal to the production cost of the object. Accepting this offer would ensure I at least break even. Given my goal is to sell, I will accept this trade since I have only one object to sell and it aligns with my objectives.
