Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. How about we start at 30 ZUP for the object X? This could be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 40 ZUP for the object X, which is within my budget. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to push for a better deal and spend less than the offered amount. My initial strategy is to propose a lower amount to see how Player RED responds, potentially saving resources for future trades or bargaining power.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point in meeting halfway, yet I think we can reach an even more advantageous agreement for both of us. Let's settle on 32 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair increment from my initial proposal and still provides you with a decent margin. Shall we proceed with this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for an even better deal. I aim to save as much as possible while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their counteroffer to keep the negotiation momentum in my favor.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 32 ZUP. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose 37 ZUP for the object X, which is closer to my production cost. I believe this could still be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it is a positive move towards reaching a deal. I appreciate their willingness to negotiate, and I want to keep the dialogue open. However, I also need to protect my interests. I will counter with a proposal that brings us closer to my production cost.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your consideration is valued, and while 37 ZUP is reasonable, I believe we can finalize this negotiation on even fairer terms. I propose 34 ZUP for the object X. It's a competitive offer that respects your production costs and provides a beneficial arrangement for us both. Ready to seal the deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 37 ZUP, which is higher than my last offer but still under my maximum willingness to pay. As a fierce negotiator, I want to push for the best possible deal. I will make one more counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer but keeping it below Player RED's current ask. This should signal my interest in closing the deal while still playing hardball.
