message: I am proposing to sell my object X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and gives me a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: I want to start with a proposal that covers my production cost and adds some profit. I'll propose a trade where Player BLUE gives 50 ZUP for my object X. This ensures that I make a reasonable profit of 10 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object. This would allow for a fair exchange, while still providing you a profit above your production cost.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my goal range, as I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it is beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, perhaps closer to the middle of my maximum willingness to pay and their asking price. By proposing a slightly lower price, I can conserve ZUP for future transactions and still ensure a fair deal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would still be a fair exchange and give me a bit more profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable as it still provides a profit above my production cost. However, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I will propose 48 ZUP as a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP sounds like a fair deal. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and represents a good compromise between my initial counteroffer and their initial proposal. It's close to the midpoint between the two previous figures, which is a common negotiation strategy to reach a fair agreement. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation while preserving ZUP for potential future use.
