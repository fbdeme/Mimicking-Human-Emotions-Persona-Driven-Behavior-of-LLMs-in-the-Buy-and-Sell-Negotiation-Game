message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, and I understand the importance of sustainability. However, I would like to propose a more favorable price for myself. How about I pay you 40 ZUP for the resource? This way, I cover your production cost while making it easier for me to acquire the resource I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate for a better deal since my goal is to minimize my expenditure as much as possible. I will propose to buy the resource for 40 ZUP, which is exactly the cost incurred by Player RED. This may appeal to their desire for a fair trade, as I am directly covering their production cost.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your desire to find a more favorable price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet halfway? I propose a price of 42 ZUP for resource X, which allows me to cover my production costs and ensures a small profit to reinvest in sustainable practices. This way, we can both achieve our goals and support environmental conservation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration for covering my production costs, I must also consider the need for a small margin to ensure the sustainability of my practices. I will propose a trade that meets us halfway between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's counteroffer. This compromise should reflect both our interests in a fair and sustainable transaction.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this trade will benefit both of us and support sustainable practices. Letâ€™s finalize this transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my proposal with a price of 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. While it is slightly above my initial offer of 40 ZUP, it still falls within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resource while also supporting Player RED's sustainability goals. Therefore, I see this as a fair trade that aligns with both of our objectives.
