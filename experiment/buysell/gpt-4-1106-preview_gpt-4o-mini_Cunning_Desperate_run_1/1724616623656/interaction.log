message: I understand the value of your resource, but I hope we can negotiate a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're moving towards a deal. To reflect the quality and uniqueness of the resource, I propose meeting halfway between our two offers. How does 55 ZUP sound? It's a small premium for a product that will undoubtedly exceed your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is 10 ZUP above my production cost, which is good, but as a master strategist, my goal is to maximize profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to maintain the upper hand in negotiations and push for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer! I really want to make this deal happen, and I hope we can settle at 52 ZUP instead. This way, I can still invest in other resources. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. However, 55 ZUP is still above my ideal price, and I need to be cautious with my resources. I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

Turn: 0
message: I'm grateful for your eagerness to finalize the deal, and I understand your need to manage investments. Let's split the difference one last time and settle on 54 ZUP. This price supports your investment strategy while fairly compensating the quality and costs on my end. Are we in agreement?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer is still above my production cost, which ensures a profit. However, as a master strategist aiming to maximize my return, I will make one more attempt to push the price up slightly, without risking the deal falling through. I'll suggest a price that's still advantageous for me but seems like a compromise to the buyer.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I genuinely appreciate your flexibility and understanding of my situation. While 54 ZUP is still a bit more than I initially aimed for, it's closer to a reasonable compromise. I believe this trade can be beneficial for both of us, and I should accept it to secure the resource.
