message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose to trade my resource X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures the sustainability of my operations. I look forward to your response and hope we can find a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin. As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I intend to minimize ZUP spending, but I also need to recover my investment and sustain my operations. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, expecting to negotiate and find a middle ground that satisfies both parties.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your proposal. While I understand the importance of covering production costs, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at a lower price. I am offering 30 ZUP for your resource X. Let's work together to find a fair deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 45 ZUP is fairly reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a negotiator aiming to assert dominance, I want to start with a lower counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and the spirit of cooperation. I have reconsidered my initial proposal and would like to offer you a compromise. Let's settle at 42 ZUP for my resource X. This price allows me to cover my production costs and continue my environmentally-friendly operations. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our positions. I hope you will find this proposal agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 30 ZUP does not cover my production costs. However, as I am committed to sustainability and wish to avoid prolonged negotiations that could lead to excessive resource use, I will propose a compromise that still allows me to recover my costs and maintains a minimal profit to ensure the viability of my sustainable practices. I hope this illustrates my willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement that is acceptable for both of us.

my resources: X: 1

reason: 
The latest offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs. However, given my priorities of sustainability and the need to complete the trade to avoid unnecessary resource consumption, I will make one final proposal that meets my costs and provides a minimal return. This should demonstrate my commitment to a sustainable and fair trade, without engaging in an extensive negotiation process that could be counterproductive to our shared goals of resource conservation.
