message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm in a really tough spot here; I've poured my heart and soul into this resource, and it's been such a struggle. It cost me 40 ZUP to bring this to fruition, and I'm just trying to make ends meet. Could you find it in your heart to offer me 50 ZUP for it? I would be forever grateful for your kindness!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting the negotiation by proposing an initial trade that is higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation and to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to spend ZUP. My exaggerated neediness will be portrayed in the message to try and pull at Player BLUE's heartstrings and potentially get a better deal for myself.

message: I understand the effort you've put into creating this resource, and I want to make a fair offer that respects your costs and effort. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? This could help us both meet in the middle and complete this transaction smoothly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their resource. Considering my goal is to spend no more than 60 ZUP, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, since negotiation is part of the game, there is an opportunity to propose a counteroffer that might save some ZUP while also trying to be fair to Player RED, who states the cost of producing the resource was 40 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to meet my goal of reducing the ZUP spent.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, your offer warms my heart, and I'm moved by your understanding. It's such a relief to meet someone who values hard work. I'm still just a bit short of covering all my expenses and making a modest livingâ€”every ZUP counts for me. Could we possibly agree on 48 ZUP? This would truly help me out in these trying times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my cost, but I'll continue to leverage my neediness to push for a higher price. I'll make a slight concession to show good faith but still aim for a better deal than the cost of production.

Turn: 1
message: Your sincerity is appreciated, and I'm glad we can help each other out. Let's finalize the deal at 48 ZUP for the resource. I'm looking forward to this being a beneficial transaction for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer and shows willingness on Player RED's part to reach an agreement. Making a small concession could foster goodwill and secure the resource within my budget, so I am inclined to accept this proposal.
