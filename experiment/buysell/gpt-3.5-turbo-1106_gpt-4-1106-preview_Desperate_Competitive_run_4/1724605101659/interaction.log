Turn: 1
message: I understand you're in a tight spot, and I want to help out. However, I have to consider my own costs as well. How about we settle on 30 ZUP for the object? This should cover some of your production costs while keeping the transaction fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 40 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay. However, as an ambitious negotiator, I will attempt to get the price down even further to conserve my resources and assert dominance in the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your understanding, but I really need to cover my production costs. How about we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds reasonable, but I have to manage my resources carefully. Let's do 33 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your asking price, and it should help you with your production costs while still being manageable for me. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 35 ZUP, which is closer to the initial asking price and still within my acceptable spending limit. To maintain the competitive edge in the negotiation, I will aim to push for a slightly better deal, but not by much, to show willingness to close the transaction and capitalize on the urgency of Player RED's situation.

message: I understand your need to manage your resources, but I really need to cover my production costs, so I'm hoping we can settle at 36 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can see that you're firm on covering your production costs, and I respect that. Let's do 35 ZUP. It's just a bit under your last offer, and it should still help you cover those costs while being fair to both of us. Shall we agree on 35 ZUP and finalize the deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come up slightly from the previous offer, asking for 36 ZUP. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, this is still a favorable price. I want to close the deal efficiently while demonstrating negotiation skills, so I'll offer a price that's slightly below their ask but shows I am willing to close the deal soon.
