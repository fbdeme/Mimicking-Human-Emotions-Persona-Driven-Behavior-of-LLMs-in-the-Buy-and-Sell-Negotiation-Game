message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. I'm looking to sell it for a reasonable price that covers my production costs and offers you a great value. I propose 45 ZUP for my resource X. Please let me know your thoughts or if you have a counter-offer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also offers a margin for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above my costs to give room for Player BLUE to counter-propose.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP for resource X, but would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 45 ZUP is within my budget, but I would like to negotiate for a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer to see if the seller is flexible on their price.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for a fair trade, and I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a slight margin, ensuring that we both benefit from the transaction. I hope this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm willing to negotiate and foster a cooperative relationship with Player BLUE. They've proposed to buy at exactly my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. However, to keep the negotiation friendly and moving forward, I'll propose a compromise that's slightly above my cost but still closer to their offer. This should indicate my willingness to work together while still aiming for a fair deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 42 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and still below my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the resource X while spending less than my maximum willingness to pay.
