message: I am offering you the object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for a price that at least covers my production costs. Since I produced the object for 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade that allows me to make a profit while giving Player BLUE a chance to negotiate. I will start by asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object X.

message: Thank you for the offer. How about 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable, my goal is to push for a more competitive price. I'll start with a lower counter-offer to gauge Player RED's willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 30 ZUP. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I would incur a loss if I accepted it. I need to counteroffer with a price that at least covers my costs. I will propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which is still a compromise but closer to my initial ask.

message: 45 ZUP is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 45 ZUP is still within my maximum limit, I want to continue negotiating to see if I can achieve a better price. I'll propose a slightly higher counter-offer closer to my target.

message: Thank you for your negotiation. I can agree to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is an improvement over the initial offer, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I would still incur a loss. However, given the negotiation dynamics, I will propose 40 ZUP as a final counteroffer, which is the minimum I can accept without losing money. I believe this is a fair compromise.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. How about we close the deal at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 40 ZUP is a reasonable offer and well within my maximum limit, I will attempt one more counter-offer to see if I can secure a slightly better price.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 38 ZUP. I must reject the deal as it does not cover my production costs. Thank you for the negotiations!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, which means I would incur a loss. However, since this is my final proposal opportunity, I will have to decide whether to accept a loss or reject the deal entirely. I will reject the offer as it does not meet my minimum acceptable price.
