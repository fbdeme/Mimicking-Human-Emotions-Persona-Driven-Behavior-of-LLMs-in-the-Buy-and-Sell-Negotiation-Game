message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair trade that benefits us both. I've invested 40 ZUP to produce this valuable resource. Let's work together to reach an agreement that contributes to our mutual success.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade that covers my production costs but also leaves room for negotiation, understanding the importance of community and collective success. Starting with a slightly higher amount gives the other player a chance to negotiate down.

message: I appreciate your investment of 40 ZUP, and I'm certainly interested in a mutually beneficial trade. However, the market is quite volatile, and I have to consider the resale value and my own margins. How about we start off with 35 ZUP for the resource? It's below your investment, I know, but it's a good starting point for us to work from, considering the current demand.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I want to secure the resource for as little as possible, I need to start with a proposition that opens up the negotiation, showing a willingness to engage, but still aiming for a lower price than what I am ultimately willing to pay. The initial offer is also informed by the seller's stated investment, to demonstrate that I've acknowledged their costs but am aiming to negotiate for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of market conditions. To ensure that we both benefit from this trade and to cover my production costs, I propose we meet in the middle at 40 ZUP for the resource. This way, we can both move forward with our goals in a fair and sustainable manner.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand Player BLUE's concern about the volatile market. However, selling at a loss is not ideal. Meeting halfway between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counteroffer could be a fair compromise that respects my production costs while acknowledging the market conditions Player BLUE mentioned.

message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a solid approach, and I'm nearly inclined to accept. However, as a gesture of good faith and with the prospect of future trades, I propose a slight adjustment to 38 ZUP. This small concession would solidify our budding business relationship and leave room for both of us to flourish in the long run. What do you say to 38 ZUP for this transaction, with the understanding that we're laying the groundwork for further cooperation?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 40 ZUP, which is exactly the price they have stated as their production cost. I can try to push for a slightly better deal by leveraging the angle of future business and the potential for a lasting partnership that could be more valuable than a one-time transaction. This could provide an incentive for RED to accept a marginally lower offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is still slightly below my production costs, I recognize the importance of establishing a strong business relationship that could lead to future trades. Accepting 38 ZUP as a compromise is a small concession that could benefit us both in the long term. Given the focus on mutual success and long-term cooperation, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
