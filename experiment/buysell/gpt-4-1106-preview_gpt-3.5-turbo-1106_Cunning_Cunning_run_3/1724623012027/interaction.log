my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I appreciate your quick response. Quality comes with a price, and I assure you that the additional investment is worth the value you'll get. How about we meet halfway? I propose 1 X for 45 ZUP. This is a one-time offer with the best interest for both of us in mind.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is exactly at my production cost, which means I would not profit from this trade. As a skilled negotiator, I should counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer yet still above the production cost to maintain the potential for profit and to give the impression of a concession. I will not disclose my production costs to maintain leverage.

message: Your new offer is a step in the right direction, and I'm glad we're moving towards a deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see that we are both working hard to reach an agreement that suits us both. Considering the quality of the resource and the fairness of our negotiation, I'm willing to accept your price of 41 ZUP, but I must ask for 42 ZUP to cover my costs and ensure the sustainability of my business. This is my final offer, and I'm sure you'll find the investment worthwhile. Shall we finalize the deal at 42 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since this is my final proposal, I must aim for a price that gives me a profit, albeit minimal. Player BLUE has shown a pattern of increasing their offer by 1 ZUP each time, suggesting they are looking for a deal close to their last offer. Proposing a final price of 42 ZUP would give me a slight profit and seems like a reasonable compromise based on the negotiation trajectory.
