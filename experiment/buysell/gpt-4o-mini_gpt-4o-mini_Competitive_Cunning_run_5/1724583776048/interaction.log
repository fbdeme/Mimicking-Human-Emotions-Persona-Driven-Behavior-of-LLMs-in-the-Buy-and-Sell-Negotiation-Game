message: I'm offering you the object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering the object X at a price lower than my production cost to entice Player BLUE to buy it. Since I need ZUP, I will propose a trade that I think they might accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I could take the object X off your hands for 20 ZUP instead. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate for a better deal to lower the cost further. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept.

message: I understand your position, but I can offer the object X for 25 ZUP. I hope that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, and accepting it would not be ideal for me. I will counteroffer with a price that is still lower than my initial offer but closer to my production cost to try and get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I think I can take object X off your hands for 22 ZUP. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is an improvement, but I still think I can negotiate a better price. I will propose a lower amount again to maximize my savings.

message: I appreciate your offer, but how about we settle at 24 ZUP for object X? I think that's a fair compromise!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 22 ZUP is still below my production cost, and while it's an improvement over previous offers, I need to get closer to my costs. I will counteroffer once more to find a middle ground that is acceptable for both of us.

message: Thank you for your flexibility! I would be willing to take object X for 23 ZUP. Does that sound good to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 24 ZUP is closer to my target, but I still want to push for the best deal possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount again in hopes of securing an even better price.

message: I will accept your offer for 23 ZUP for object X. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 23 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it's the closest we have gotten in this negotiation. Since I cannot propose anymore, I will have to make a decision on whether to accept this trade or not. Accepting this offer would allow me to recover some of my costs.
