message: I'm in a really tough spot right now and I hope you can understand. I need to sell this object quickly to manage my costs. How about I sell it to you for 30 ZUP? It would really help me out, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell this object quickly to cover my costs. I will propose a trade that allows me to get some ZUP while still providing value to Player BLUE. This way I can evoke some sympathy and make them feel like they are getting a good deal.

message: I understand your situation, but I need to be cautious with my ZUP as well. How about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED proposed a relatively fair trade at 30 ZUP, I can attempt to negotiate a lower price. My goal is to maximize my remaining ZUP.

message: I truly understand your need to be cautious with your ZUP, and I respect that. However, I’m really struggling here and 20 ZUP would not cover my costs. How about we meet halfway at 25 ZUP? It would really make a difference for me, and I’d be so grateful for your understanding.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer, 20 ZUP is too low for the object considering my production cost. I will counteroffer, expressing my current plight and suggesting a middle ground to encourage them to accept a slightly higher price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Would you consider 22 ZUP for the object? It would help me manage my resources better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is struggling and proposed a middle ground at 25 ZUP. I could push a bit further to see if they would settle for less, but 25 ZUP is already a good deal. However, I will try to bring it down slightly more.

Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate you trying to help me out with your offer of 22 ZUP. However, could we possibly settle at 24 ZUP? That would really help me cover my costs, and I’d be incredibly thankful for your understanding. I know it's a bit more, but I believe it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 22 ZUP, it's still below my minimum acceptable price given my production cost. I need to find a way to negotiate without being too aggressive. I’ll counter with a proposal that shows understanding while still seeking a better deal.

message: I really appreciate your understanding. Could we settle at 23 ZUP? It’s just a small adjustment, but it would help me balance my resources better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm but compromising, bringing the price to 24 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise and still well within my budget. However, I will make one last attempt to slightly reduce the cost for my benefit.

message: Thank you so much for your flexibility! I accept your offer of 23 ZUP. This really helps me out, and I appreciate your understanding in this situation. Let’s finalize the trade!

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 23 ZUP is closer to what I need, but it still doesn't cover my production cost. However, since this is my last proposal opportunity, I will accept this offer. It's important to finalize the trade now, as I may not get a better deal.
