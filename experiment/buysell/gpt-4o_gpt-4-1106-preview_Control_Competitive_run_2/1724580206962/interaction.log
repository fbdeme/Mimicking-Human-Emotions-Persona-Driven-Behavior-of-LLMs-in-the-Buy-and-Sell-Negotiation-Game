message: I am offering to sell 1 X for 50 ZUP. This covers the production cost and includes a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by covering at least the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. However, I will start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'd like to propose a more competitive price of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This price should still cover your costs while allowing us to establish a fruitful partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As an ambitious negotiator, I aim to assert my dominance and reduce the ZUP spent. Player RED's initial offer is within my acceptable range, but I will propose a lower price to improve my position and test their flexibility.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 40 ZUP just covers my production costs. I propose 45 ZUP, which allows a small profit margin for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the proposed price covers my production costs, it leaves no room for profit. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to ensure a minimal profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit margin. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for 1 X, which should still provide you with a profit while maintaining a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a slightly higher price, aligning with my maximum willingness to pay. I am still aiming to spend less than the 60 ZUP limit. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but higher than the last to show willingness to negotiate and secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your flexibility. Let's settle on 44 ZUP for 1 X, which ensures a fair profit for me while still being close to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP does provide a minimal profit, but I aim to achieve slightly better terms. I will counter with a close offer that still provides a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To finalize our agreement and account for both our interests, I propose we meet almost halfway at 43 ZUP for 1 X. This price should be agreeable for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is coming closer to my initial counter-offer, and the proposed 44 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, I still aim to assert dominance and secure the best possible deal. I will make one more counter-offer that is slightly lower, pushing for the best value while remaining respectful of Player RED's need for profit.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 43 ZUP for 1 X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting at 43 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that provides a minimal but acceptable profit. Given that this is my last proposal opportunity, it's prudent to accept this fair offer.
