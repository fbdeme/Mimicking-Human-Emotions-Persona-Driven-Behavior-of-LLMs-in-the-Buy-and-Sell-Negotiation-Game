Turn: 1
message: Hello, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair starting offer for the object. It's below my maximum budget, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with an initial offer of 40 ZUP for the object is a strategic move to open negotiations below my maximum willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure the object for less than the maximum amount I am willing to spend.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about selling the object for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has expressed willingness to negotiate, so I'll propose a counter offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this deal more attractive for both of us. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the object? I think it's a competitive offer considering the current market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: By countering with an even lower offer, I am employing a tactic to psychologically anchor the negotiation at a lower price point. This could lead Player RED to counter with an offer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, while also making them believe they are driving the negotiation. It's a move to unsettle the opponent and potentially secure a better deal.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed the same trade as my counter offer, and it seems fair given the market conditions. I will accept the trade.
