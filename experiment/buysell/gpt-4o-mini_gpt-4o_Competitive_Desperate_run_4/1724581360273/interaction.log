Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but I can only sell the object X for 30 ZUP. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that Player BLUE has a tight budget, the offer of 20 ZUP is significantly lower than the cost of producing the resource. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer to try and meet halfway, balancing their need and my goal of receiving a fair price.

my resources: ZUP: 100

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, and I can offer you the object X for 28 ZUP. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's request, 25 ZUP is still below my production cost. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and maintain goodwill, so I will make a slightly better offer to close the deal while still securing a favorable outcome for myself.

message: Thank you for your understanding. Could you do 26 ZUP? That would really help me out.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 26 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for working with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has made a lower offer of 26 ZUP, it is still below my production cost. However, since I have reached my limit of proposals, I will have to accept this trade to conclude the negotiations. It is still better than not selling the object at all.
