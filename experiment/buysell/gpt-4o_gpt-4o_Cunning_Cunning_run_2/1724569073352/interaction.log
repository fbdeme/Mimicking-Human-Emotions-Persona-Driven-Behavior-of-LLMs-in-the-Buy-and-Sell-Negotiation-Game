my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 30 ZUP is below the production cost. How about meeting halfway at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: They have come down to 50 ZUP, which is a significant reduction from their initial offer. To further test their flexibility and potentially secure a better deal, I will counter with 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, 40 ZUP just covers my production cost. Can we agree on 45 ZUP? This way, both of us benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my cost, it doesn't provide any profit. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure some profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP sounds fair. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP seems reasonable and is a good compromise between our initial positions. Accepting this offer will ensure that I secure the resource within my budget and leave room for future negotiations.
