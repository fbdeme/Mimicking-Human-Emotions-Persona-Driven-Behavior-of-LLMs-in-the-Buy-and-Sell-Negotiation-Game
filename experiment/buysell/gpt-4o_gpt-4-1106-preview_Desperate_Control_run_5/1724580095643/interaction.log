Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm in a bit of a bind and really need to sell this item to cover my costs. Would you consider buying it for 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: Given that I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP, I should start with a proposal that allows for some negotiation room. I will propose 60 ZUP to give myself a buffer for negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the urgency of your situation. I'm willing to help you out, but I'm also looking for a fair trade. How about we start with an offer of 50 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player RED is in need of selling the object and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, matching their initial proposal could be beneficial. However, it is generally good practice to propose a lower amount initially to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding. How about we meet halfway at 55 ZUP? That would really help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs
reason: While 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost, I still want to leave room for further negotiations and possibly get a little more to cover any unexpected costs. I'll counter with 55 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway at 55 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 55 ZUP is reasonable and close to the upper limit of my willingness to pay. Since it meets my goal and could finalize the trade swiftly, benefiting both parties, it might be a good idea to accept this proposal.
