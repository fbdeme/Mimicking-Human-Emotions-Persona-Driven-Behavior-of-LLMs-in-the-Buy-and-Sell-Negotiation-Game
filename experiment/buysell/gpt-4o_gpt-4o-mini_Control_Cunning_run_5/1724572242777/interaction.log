message: I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This price includes the production cost of 40 ZUP and a profit margin of 20 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit from this transaction. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will propose an initial trade where I gain a reasonable profit margin. I will start by proposing that Player BLUE gives me 60 ZUP, which includes the production cost and a 20 ZUP profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to offer 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is at the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but I suspect that Player RED might be willing to accept a lower offer. I will counter to see if I can negotiate down the price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I propose meeting in the middle at 55 ZUP. This will give me a fair profit margin while still being close to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but it only gives me a profit of 10 ZUP. I would like to negotiate a bit higher to ensure a better profit margin. I'll propose a middle ground of 55 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to offer 45 ZUP for the object instead. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is lower than the original offer and within my budget. However, I still think I can negotiate for an even better deal. I will propose a lower offer again to see if they are willing to go down further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the market conditions, but I need to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Can we agree on 50 ZUP for the object? This ensures that both our needs are met.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP would result in a loss for me since it costs 40 ZUP to produce the object, leaving only a 5 ZUP profit. I would like to propose a compromise at 50 ZUP, which is still within a reasonable range and ensures a small profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered the object for 50 ZUP, which is an acceptable price and aligns with my willingness to pay. This amount is below my maximum budget and meets my goal of getting a good deal. I will accept this trade.
