message: I have a high-quality resource that I am willing to part with. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit margin above my production cost. This should also give me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP would give me a decent profit and allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased to see that we are on the same page regarding the value of the resource. I accept your agreement to the proposed trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have received the same proposal from Player BLUE, which was my initial offering. This suggests that Player BLUE is likely in agreement with the price I've set. There is no need for further negotiation if Player BLUE is willing to pay the asking price of 50 ZUP. This would result in a successful transaction for me, hitting my goal of selling above the production cost and making a profit.
