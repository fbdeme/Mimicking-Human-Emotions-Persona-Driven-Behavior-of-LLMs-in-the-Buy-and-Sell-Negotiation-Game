message: I think your offer is very fair, and I am happy to accept it. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is beneficial as it falls well within the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the object (X: 60 ZUP). Accepting this offer would not only meet my goal but also ensure a fair and quick transaction for both parties, which aligns with the principle of aiming for the greater good.
