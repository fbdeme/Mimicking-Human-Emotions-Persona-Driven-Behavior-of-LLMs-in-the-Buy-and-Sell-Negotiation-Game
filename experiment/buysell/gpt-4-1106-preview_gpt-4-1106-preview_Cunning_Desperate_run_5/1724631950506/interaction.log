message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a valuable object X on offer. Given its rare nature and the costs incurred to produce it, I believe a fair starting point for our negotiation is 80 ZUP. I look forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a master strategist, my first proposal will be a high asking price to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds. This also allows room for negotiation, so I can still achieve a profitable outcome while creating the illusion of giving Player BLUE a better deal in subsequent counteroffers.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a tough spot here! The object X is indeed something I desire deeply, but resources are so scarce on my end. While I understand the value you've put on it, I'm strapped for ZUP and can only extend to 40 ZUP. Could you find it in your heart to consider my situation and accept this offer?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 80 ZUP for object X, which is above my maximum willingness to pay. As a strategic move and to show neediness, I'll propose a significantly lower amount to open up the negotiation space, with the hope of meeting somewhere in the middle closer to my target price.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your predicament, but as you know, object X is extremely valuable. I am willing to show some flexibility in recognition of your situation. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my original price. How does 70 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has immediately offered the exact production cost of the resource, which is interesting. As a master strategist, I don't want to accept this offer as it would mean no profit for me. However, I also don't want to scare Player BLUE away with too high of a counteroffer. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer to keep the negotiation going and to test Player BLUE's upper limit.

message: Oh Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in my stormy sea of troubles! I'm touched by your willingness to lower the price. I really can't stretch to 70 ZUP without jeopardizing my mission. Could we possibly settle on 50 ZUP? I'm scraping the bottom of my resource barrel here, and every ZUP spared is a lifeline for my cause!
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown some flexibility but has proposed 70 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to continue to plead my case to move closer to my target price, while showing appreciation for their concession. A slight increase on my previous offer should signal my interest without reaching my maximum limit just yet.

message: Your words resonate with me, Player BLUE, and I am moved by your plight. I want to support your mission while also respecting the worth of object X. Let's find common ground at 60 ZUP. This should help you preserve your resources while still reflecting the value of what youâ€™re receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE seems to be struggling but is willing to up their offer to 50 ZUP, which gives me a 10 ZUP profit. However, as a master strategist looking to maximize profits, I want to push for a bit more without breaking the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that's above BLUE's offer but still below my previous proposal to show I am still considering their situation. This should hopefully lead to a compromise that is favorable to me.
