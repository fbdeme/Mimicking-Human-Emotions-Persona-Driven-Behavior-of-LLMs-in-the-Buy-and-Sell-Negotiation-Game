Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I recognize the effort and quality of the resource, but I must also consider my budget constraints. Let's settle on 43 ZUP, which respects the value of your product while adhering to my fiscal responsibilities. This offer is a solid middle ground that should be acceptable for both of us.

reason: The opponent's latest proposal is nearing my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain a hardline stance and to attempt to secure the resource for an even better price, I will make another incremental increase to my offer, still keeping it below the requested 44 ZUP. This should signal my interest in closing the deal while also holding firm to my negotiation strategy.
