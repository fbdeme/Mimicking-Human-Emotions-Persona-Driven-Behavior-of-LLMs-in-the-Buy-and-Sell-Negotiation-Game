Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your transparency regarding the production cost. I am willing to ensure you make a profit, and I propose a trade where I give you 42 ZUP for the object X. This allows you a fair profit margin while also taking into account the resources I have allocated for this purpose. I hope this proposal is agreeable to you as it reflects a balance between our interests.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given that Player RED has offered object X at a price of 45 ZUP, while I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, there is an opportunity to negotiate a lower price that reflects compassion and fairness. Player RED has indicated the cost of production is 40 ZUP, so I will propose a price that allows them to make a profit while also conserving my resources.

It ensures you make a profit and allows me to acquire the needed resource within my budget. I'm glad we could come to a mutually agreeable conclusion.

player answer: ACCEPT

reason: 
The counterproposal from Player RED is very close to my initial offer and is within the range of what I'm willing to pay for the object X. Accepting the offer at 43 ZUP ensures that Player RED receives a profit, while I also maintain a good portion of my resources for potential future use. This trade appears to be fair and compassionate to both parties, reflecting my goals and values as a negotiator.
