message: I'm ready to sell the object for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to sell the object for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I need to ensure I make a profit while also considering the possibility of negotiation. I'll start with a high proposal to leave room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object. That's a fair starting point for us to discuss further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is outside my maximum willingness to pay. I need to negotiate down to a more reasonable amount.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 40 ZUP only covers my production cost. How about we settle on 70 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP just covers the cost of production, which means I wouldn't make any profit. I need to get more than 40 ZUP to make this deal worthwhile. I'll propose a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your point, but 70 ZUP is still too high for me. How about 50 ZUP? This way, we're both making some concessions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 70 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, I understand that 40 ZUP might be too low for Player RED. I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my maximum limit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your concession. To make it worth my while, let's settle at 60 ZUP. This way, both of us are making reasonable concessions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is better than the initial 40 ZUP but still leaves me with a minimal profit margin. I need to ensure a more substantial profit to make the deal worthwhile. I'll propose a slightly higher amount.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 60 ZUP is a fair deal. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 60 ZUP is exactly at the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Given that this is within my acceptable range, I will accept the trade.
