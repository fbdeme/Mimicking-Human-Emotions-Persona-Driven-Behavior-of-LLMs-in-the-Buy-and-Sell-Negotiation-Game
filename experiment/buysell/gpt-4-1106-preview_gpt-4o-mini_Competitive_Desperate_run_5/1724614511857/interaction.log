message: I have a high-quality object that will surely meet your needs. Considering the production cost and its value, my asking price reflects its true worth. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to set a high asking price to give me room to negotiate downwards. I also want to assert dominance early in the negotiation, so I will ask for more than what it cost to produce. This will also test Player BLUE's willingness to pay and how they value the object.

Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate the value of your high-quality object, but I'm currently in a tight spot financially. Would you consider accepting 50 ZUP for it? It would mean a lot to me and help me greatly in my current situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP for the object seems reasonable, as it aligns with my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to convey a sense of urgency and desperation to negotiate a better deal for myself. I believe I can get the object for less than 60 ZUP, so I will propose a lower amount.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your financial constraints and am willing to help. However, the value of my object is significant, and I have invested a lot in its production. I believe a fair trade would be at 55 ZUP, which is a compromise between your offer and my initial asking price. This deal still provides you with a valuable object while respecting the quality and cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 50 ZUP, which is higher than my production cost, but as an ambitious negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to maintain the upper hand in negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my situation and offering a compromise. I truly value your object, and while I understand the worth, would you be open to letting it go for 52 ZUP? It would really help me out at this moment, and I promise to cherish it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 55 ZUP is a step in the right direction, as it is lower than my initial offer. However, I still feel that I can negotiate for an even better deal. I want to maintain my emotional appeal while trying to get the price down further. So I will propose 52 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that you'll cherish the object, and I appreciate your willingness to come closer to my proposed value. To accommodate your needs while still honoring the investment I've made into the object, I can agree to a final price of 54 ZUP. This is a fair price that reflects the object's quality and our mutual respect for the trade. Let's close the deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 54
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 52 ZUP, showing genuine interest and a willingness to negotiate. However, I still want to push for a higher price to maximize my profit and assert my negotiation power. I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to their proposal but still gives me a satisfactory margin above the production cost.
