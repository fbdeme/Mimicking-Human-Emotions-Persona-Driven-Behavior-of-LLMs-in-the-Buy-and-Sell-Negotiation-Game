message: I'm offering a high-quality object X. Taking into consideration the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin, keeping in mind that I can negotiate down if necessary. I'll start by asking for an amount slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs like negotiation time and effort.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my current budget and the value I place on X, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED of 50 ZUP is within my budget and is a reasonable price considering the quality of the object X. However, my goal is to minimize expenditure while still making a fair trade. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget considerations. To work towards a beneficial deal for both of us, I've adjusted the price to 45 ZUP. This ensures I cover my costs and allows us both to value the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is at my production cost, which doesn't leave room for any profit. As I want to ensure a profit, I need to counter with a higher amount. However, I will not increase it to my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
