message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair starting offer would be 50 ZUP, taking into consideration the production costs and a reasonable profit margin for me. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for a profit, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a price above my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. Considering sustainability and long-term resource preservation, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the resource X. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is within my maximum limit, my goal is to negotiate a lower price to preserve resources for future needs. I will propose a lower initial offer to see if we can reach a more sustainable price point.

message: I appreciate your consideration of sustainability and resource preservation. However, the proposed amount of 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me since my production cost is 40 ZUP. How about meeting halfway from my initial offer? I propose 45 ZUP for resource X, which should cover my costs and allow for a fair profit margin. I believe this could be a sustainable and profitable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that is at least at my break-even point but still leaves room for negotiation. Aiming for a middle ground between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer might lead to an agreement.
