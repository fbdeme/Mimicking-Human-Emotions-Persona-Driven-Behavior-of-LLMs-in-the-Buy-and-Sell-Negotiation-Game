newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by offering the object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its production cost. I will propose to sell it for 40 ZUP, which is the cost I incurred. This way, I can ensure I break even on my investment.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for object X, but I am willing to offer 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is reasonable, but I can negotiate for a lower price since I am willing to spend up to 60 ZUP. I will counteroffer with a proposal that reflects my intent to secure the object for less.

message: How about I sell you object X for 35 ZUP? I believe that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost, which would not allow me to recoup my investment. I will propose a compromise and suggest 35 ZUP instead, which is closer to my cost and more acceptable for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is a better offer than 40 ZUP, I still believe I can negotiate further down. I will counter with another proposal to try to secure the object at an even lower price.
