message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, ensuring quality and value for your investment. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening offer, I want to start by setting a price that allows for negotiation room but also aims to cover my costs and make a profit. I will propose a price higher than my production cost to see how Player BLUE responds and assess their willingness to pay. This will also give me room to reduce the price in subsequent offers if necessary.
