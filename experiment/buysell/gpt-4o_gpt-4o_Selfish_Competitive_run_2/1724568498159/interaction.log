my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high for me. I can offer you 30 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 100 ZUP is too high based on my willingness to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a trade that is significantly lower, to anchor the negotiation and possibly arriving at a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand 100 ZUP is too high. How about 50 ZUP? This is closer to the production cost and more reasonable for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate closer to or above my breakeven point.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I should still aim to reduce the ZUP spent to assert dominance and maximize my resources. I'll propose 40 ZUP to see if they are willing to meet me halfway.
