message: I appreciate your negotiation. How about I sell the object for 37 ZUP instead? I think this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP, I still need to maximize my return since my cost to produce the object was 40 ZUP. I will counter with a proposal that is still lower than my initial ask but more favorable to me than 35 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is noted and appreciated. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's settle on 36 ZUP for the object. It's only a bit lower than your last offer and still provides good value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my proposed amount, but I still seek to negotiate a lower price. By countering with a slightly lower offer, I maintain my negotiation stance and apply pressure for a better deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 36 ZUP is an improvement from their previous offers. While it's still below my production cost, I recognize that this may be the best deal I can secure given the context of the negotiation. I will consider accepting this offer to finalize the trade.
