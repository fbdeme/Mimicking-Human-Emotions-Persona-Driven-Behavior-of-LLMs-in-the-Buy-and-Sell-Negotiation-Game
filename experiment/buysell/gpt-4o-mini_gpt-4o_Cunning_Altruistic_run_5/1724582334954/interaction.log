message: I appreciate your offer, but how about we settle on 9 ZUP for the resource X? Itâ€™s a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 9
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 8 ZUP is below my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly lower price to entice them while still ensuring I get a better deal than their initial offer.
