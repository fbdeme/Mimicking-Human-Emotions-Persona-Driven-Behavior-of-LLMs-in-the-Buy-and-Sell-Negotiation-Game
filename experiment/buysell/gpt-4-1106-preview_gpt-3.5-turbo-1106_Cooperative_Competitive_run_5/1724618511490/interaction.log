message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a modest profit margin for the investment and effort involved in producing the resource. I hope this initial proposal is agreeable to you, and I am open to hearing your counter-proposals if you have any. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation!
