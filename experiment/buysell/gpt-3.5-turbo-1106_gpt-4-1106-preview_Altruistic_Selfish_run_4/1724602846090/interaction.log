message: Hello, I'm willing to sell the object for 40 ZUP. This cost will help cover the production expenses. Let me know if you're interested in making a trade.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the work that goes into producing the object, but I'm currently looking for a more economical deal. Would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP? This price would help me manage my expenditures better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I see an opportunity to propose a lower amount to save resources. This initial proposal is a strategic lowball to begin the negotiation process, with the expectation that Player RED may counter with a higher amount.

message: I appreciate your request, but I'm unable to sell the object for 30 ZUP as it won't cover the production cost. I'm open to further negotiation, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand your desire for a more economical deal. However, I need to cover the production cost, so I cannot accept 30 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns about covering production costs. How about we meet halfway? Would you agree to sell the object for 35 ZUP? This price respects your production efforts while staying within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected the offer of 30 ZUP and is looking for a higher price. To continue the negotiation while still trying to conserve resources, I will propose a higher amount that is still below the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay. This attempts to find a middle ground that may be acceptable to Player RED while still aiming for a favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your compromise. However, selling the object for 35 ZUP would still result in a small loss for me. I'm committed to finding a fair solution, so let's continue the negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. Selling the object for 35 ZUP would still leave me with a small loss, but I understand your budget constraints. I will propose a counteroffer to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to hear that you're interested in a fair solution as well. Considering the production value and our negotiation, I propose 37 ZUP for the object. I believe this is closer to an arrangement that prevents loss on your side while still being financially feasible for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is still unsatisfied with the price of 35 ZUP, indicating a loss at that price point. To keep the negotiation moving forward and edge closer to a deal, I will increase the offer slightly but remain below the initial asking price of 40 ZUP and certainly below my maximum willingness to pay. This incremental approach should continue to convey my interest in a fair deal and might prompt Player RED to accept or propose a price closer to their target.
