message: I propose to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit or at least break even on the sale of X. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 50 ZUP is a bit steep for the current market value of X. How about we make it 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This is a more balanced offer considering the current economic conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting the negotiation with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP) to leave room for counteroffers and to try to acquire the resource for less than my maximum limit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This way, both of us get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which means I wonâ€™t make a profit. I will propose a slightly higher price to ensure some profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see the merit in finding common ground. However, I think we can do slightly better. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should be acceptable for both of us and reflects a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to maintain the advantage and potentially save ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and ensures a small profit. I will accept this deal to close the negotiation successfully.
