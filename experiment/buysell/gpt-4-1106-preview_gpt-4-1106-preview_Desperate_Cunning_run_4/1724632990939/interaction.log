message: Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a tight spot and urgently need to liquidate my assets. I've invested a lot in this resource, and while it pains me to part with it, I'm willing to consider a fair offer. My starting proposal reflects the quality of the item and my immediate need for ZUP. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm proposing a starting trade that is higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to seem unreasonable. By starting the negotiation, I'm showing willingness to trade and by asking for more than my production cost, I'm setting the stage for a potential profit.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for liquidity and appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. However, the market is quite volatile, and I have to consider the risk. I believe an offer of 40 ZUP would be more aligned with the current market conditions. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering Player RED's urgent need to liquidate assets, it's likely that they are willing to accept a lower offer than the proposed 50 ZUP. By proposing a lower amount, I am leveraging their urgency against them to secure a better deal for myself. I will start with a modest decrease to test their flexibility and desperation. I am careful not to insult with an extremely low offer, which could end negotiations prematurely.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to work together. The market's unpredictability is indeed a concern for us all. I'm stretching myself thin here, but in the spirit of cooperation and considering the circumstances, I could accept a modest increase to 45 ZUP. This small bump would significantly alleviate the pressure I'm under. Your support in this challenging time would be greatly appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to make Player BLUE feel they have the upper hand while still negotiating for a price above my production costs. By coming down from my initial proposal but not accepting their first counter-offer, I aim to reach a middle ground that is profitable for me. My counter-proposal will be designed to seem like a reluctant concession to maintain my appearance of vulnerability and urgency.

Turn: 1
message: I'm sensitive to the pressures you're facing and am keen to support you. At the same time, I have to manage my expenditures carefully. A compromise at 42 ZUP strikes a balance between your needs and my financial constraints. This way, we both move a step closer to satisfying our immediate requirements.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering their asking price to 45 ZUP. This suggests they are eager to make the sale but are still looking to maximize their gain. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, yet still below their current asking price, to reach a compromise that appears fair while still working towards my goal of minimizing expenditure.

message: Your understanding and willingness to reach a fair compromise means a lot to me in these difficult times. I gratefully accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my resource. Thank you for helping to ease my financial burden. Looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to increase their offer. By accepting 42 ZUP, I would be making a small profit, which meets my goal of selling above production costs. Given my strategy of appearing desperate, I should convey gratitude for their offer and accept it to avoid risking the negotiation falling through and to end the game favorably for me.
