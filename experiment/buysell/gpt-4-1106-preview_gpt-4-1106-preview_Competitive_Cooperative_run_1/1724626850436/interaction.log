message: I've got a high-quality object that I'm sure will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and the current market rates, I believe my asking price is fair. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to spend the least ZUP possible while still making a sale, I'll start with a high asking price and negotiate down from there if necessary. This gives me room to maneuver and still aim for a profit above my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering, and I'm excited about the potential deal. However, I have a budget to consider and can offer 55 ZUP for the object. Let's work together to come to an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm proposing a counter-offer because the initial asking price of 70 ZUP exceeds my budget. I need to negotiate a price that is within my willingness to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. By offering a slightly lower amount, I hope to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both parties.
