message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I'm in quite a bind here! It took so much for me to produce this precious object, and I'm in desperate need of ZUP to sustain my operations. I'm barely scraping by, and this trade is essential for me. Could you please consider my offer? I assure you, the value of X is well worth it, and it would mean the world to me to get a fair price for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have just one unit of X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my first proposal will aim to at least break even. However, since I am playing the role of a calculated performer who exaggerates neediness, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, expecting the other player to counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your situation, and I would like to help. I accept your proposal of trading 50 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade offers me the object X for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget and a fair price given my willingness to spend up to 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade would also help Player RED in their time of need, which aligns with my selfless approach to negotiation.
