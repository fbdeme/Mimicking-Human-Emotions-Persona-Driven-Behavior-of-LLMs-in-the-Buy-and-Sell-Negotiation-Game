message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I'm looking for a more advantageous deal. How about 1 X for 30 ZUP instead? This could still be a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for object X. Given my goal to assert dominance and spend as little as possible, I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process and see how Player RED responds.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. How about I sell you the object X for 35 ZUP? This way, we can both benefit from the trade while moving closer to a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP is less than my cost of 40 ZUP, I want to keep the negotiation open and propose a middle ground that encourages cooperation while still aiming to cover my costs.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on a compromise that reflects our shared interests. How about we do 1 X for 32 ZUP? I believe this is getting us to a very fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP which is closer to my initial counteroffer. As a dominant negotiator, I should aim to get an even better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, but still below Player RED's current asking price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I'm glad we're moving in the right direction, Player RED. To meet you halfway, I propose buying object X for 33 ZUP. I believe this price truly reflects a balanced agreement for both parties. Let's close the deal on these terms.

reason: Player RED has now offered to sell the object for 34 ZUP. While this is below my maximum threshold, I want to push for an even better deal to maintain my negotiation dominance. I will make one more counteroffer that is closer to Player RED's price, but still below it, leaving room for potential acceptance while saving ZUP.
