message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering the object for 35 ZUP, which is a bit lower than my production cost to make it more appealing. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for a fair price that covers my production cost while also being reasonable for Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that is slightly less than my production cost to make it attractive for the buyer.

message: Thank you for your offer. While 35 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. I believe this could be beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure a fair deal for both parties while keeping my costs low. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to propose 37 ZUP for the object instead. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 30 ZUP is lower than my production cost, I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot accept this offer as it does not cover my costs. I will propose a counteroffer that is fair to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counterproposal. I appreciate your willingness to reach a fair compromise. How about we settle at 33 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 37 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to ensure a lower cost to maximize my resources. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my previous offer to show willingness to compromise.

newly proposed trade: NONE
