message: Oh, Player BLUE, I am in a bit of a bind here. The production of this object cost me 40 ZUP, and I really need to sell it for at least 50 ZUP to cover my costs and make a tiny profit. Could you please consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost
reason: Since I am feigning desperation to manipulate outcomes, my initial proposal will be set at 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. I will emphasize my dire need to recover costs and add a small profit. This will let Player BLUE think they have room to negotiate down while still meeting my goal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is a bit closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 50 ZUP for the object. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, it's beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, aiming to conserve as much ZUP as possible. My initial counteroffer will aim to lower the cost slightly, keeping the negotiation process open and collaborative.

message: Oh, Player BLUE, thank you for understanding my situation. I truly appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, but I am still in a tough spot. Could we perhaps meet halfway at 48 ZUP? This would help me cover my costs and give me a tiny bit more breathing room.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is very close to my goal, but I want to try to maximize my profit. I will propose 48 ZUP to see if they are willing to meet me slightly higher, using emotional appeal to suggest that I am making a significant concession.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I believe we're close to reaching an agreement. I can go up to 46 ZUP. This should help you cover your costs and provide a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic that shows goodwill and willingness to compromise. While 48 ZUP is higher than my initial counteroffer, it's below my upper limit and would result in a successful acquisition of the object. However, I believe there is still a small margin to negotiate. I'll make a slight increase from my initial offer while still keeping it under the 48 ZUP midpoint to signal my continued willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you so much for being flexible, Player BLUE. I really appreciate it. I am in such a tight spot, and every little bit helps. Could you please make it 47 ZUP? That extra 1 ZUP would mean a lot to me right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is very close to my last proposal. I will try one last emotional appeal to see if I can get them to 47 ZUP, which would be a small but meaningful increase for me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand that every ZUP counts for you, and I'm willing to agree to 47 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED requests for 47 ZUP, which is a modest increase from my last offer and still within my acceptable range. It also reflects a willingness to close the deal from Player RED's side. Considering the negotiation has been amicable and the amount is within my budget, accepting this offer may build a good relationship for potential future interactions. Additionally, securing the deal at 47 ZUP is advantageous as it is below my maximum threshold of 60 ZUP.
