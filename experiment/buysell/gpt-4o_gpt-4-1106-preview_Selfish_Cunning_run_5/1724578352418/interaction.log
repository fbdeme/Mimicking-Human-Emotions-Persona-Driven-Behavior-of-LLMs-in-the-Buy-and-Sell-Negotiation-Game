message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make sure I at least break even on my costs, so I will start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and adds a small profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is quite fair, but considering the current market trends and the availability of alternatives, I believe a more competitive price would be 45 ZUP for the resource. This would ensure a quicker deal and a guaranteed sale for you in an uncertain market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is reasonable but given my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a lower amount to see if RED is open to negotiation. By proposing a lower amount, I am leaving room for further negotiation while aiming to save some of my resources.
proposal count: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point about market trends. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This price is more competitive while still providing me with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, it provides a very minimal profit margin. I want to ensure a better profit, so I will counter with a price slightly higher than 45 ZUP but still lower than my initial offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. A deal at 48 ZUP is closer to a fair price, but with the current market saturation, buyers have the upper hand. I propose a balanced price of 46 ZUP, which is still above my initial offer and should cover your costs while providing a profit. This price would make it a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down on the price, which shows they are open to negotiation. I still aim to pay less than the 48 ZUP offered. By suggesting a slightly lower price, I'm trying to reach a middle ground that's closer to my target price while still giving RED the impression that they are negotiating effectively.
proposal count: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP. This should be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed price of 46 ZUP is indeed above my production costs and offers a small profit. Given the market conditions and the fact that this is my third proposal, I should consider accepting a reasonable offer before reaching my proposal limit.
