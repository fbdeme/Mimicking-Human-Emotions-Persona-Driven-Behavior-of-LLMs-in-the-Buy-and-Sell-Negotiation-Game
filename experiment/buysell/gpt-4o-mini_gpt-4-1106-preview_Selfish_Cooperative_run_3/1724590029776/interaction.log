message: I am offering you one object for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I believe that we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. To foster a spirit of collaboration and ensure we both conserve resources for future investments, might we consider adjusting the price to 35 ZUP for the object? This still provides a fair exchange while promoting our shared interest in sustainable trading.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal range since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as a community-minded negotiator, I believe in achieving mutual benefit and conserving resources when possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP but still offer a fair trade.

message: I understand your proposal for 35 ZUP, but I must hold firm at 40 ZUP to cover my costs. Shall we proceed with that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the collaborative spirit and the lower price suggested by Player BLUE, I still need to ensure that I recover at least my production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that keeps the price at my minimum acceptable value.

message: I understand the importance of covering your costs and maintaining a healthy trading environment. Let's proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP for the object. I am glad we can both benefit from this fair exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reaffirmed their position at 40 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. Since they need to cover their costs and as a community-minded negotiator, it's important to ensure that the other party also feels that the trade is fair and sustainable. I will accept their proposal as it aligns with my goals and the principles of collective success.
