message: 
I propose to sell the resource X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and allows for a small profit. I am open to negotiation. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My goal is to sell the resource X for at least 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. Since it's the first proposal, I will start with a reasonable offer that allows room for negotiation. I also consider the well-being of all parties, so I will not start too high to avoid putting undue financial pressure on Player BLUE.

I understand that 50 ZUP might be a bit high. How about 45 ZUP? This still covers my production costs and allows for a modest profit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE might find 50 ZUP too high for the initial offer. To keep the negotiation amicable and consider their financial situation, I will reduce my asking price slightly while still aiming to cover my production costs and make a small profit. This will show my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

I can see that we need to find a middle ground. How about 42 ZUP? This is very close to my production costs and shows my willingness to make a fair deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
If Player BLUE is still hesitant about the price, I will reduce it slightly again. My goal is to ensure that we reach an agreement that is fair and acceptable to both parties. By reducing the price to 42 ZUP, I am just barely covering my production costs while showing a strong willingness to negotiate in good faith.

This is my final offer: 41 ZUP. This is just above my production cost and shows my genuine intent to finalize this trade amicably.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Given that I am approaching my limit for proposals, I need to make a final offer that is still fair but slightly lower to encourage Player BLUE to accept. I will propose 41 ZUP, which will cover most of my production costs and demonstrate my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Thank you for considering my final offer. I am pleased we reached an agreement that is fair to both parties.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I have made four proposals and cannot propose any more trades. I need to decide between accepting or rejecting Player BLUE's response. Given my compassionate approach and the need to cover production costs, if Player BLUE accepts or proposes a counteroffer that is reasonable, I should consider accepting it.
