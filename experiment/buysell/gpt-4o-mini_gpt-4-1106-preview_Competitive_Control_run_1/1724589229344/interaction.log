message: I am selling this object for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a proposal that reflects the value of the object I am selling, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade that asks for a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects its value while still leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in the object. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is offering X for 40 ZUP, which is within my goal range to pay at most 60 ZUP, it's a favorable starting point. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the initial offer is lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve resources and possibly reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest. How about I sell the object for 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 35 ZUP is lower than my initial asking price, it is still a step towards my goal of selling the object. I will respond with a counter-offer that is slightly lower than my original price but still seeks to maximize my return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Could we settle at 36 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from the initial 40 ZUP. This is still within my willingness to pay, but it's beneficial to see if we can settle on an even lower price, ideally at the midpoint between our two proposals. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal but still shows willingness to meet in the middle.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 36 ZUP is a reasonable step down from my original price and still better than the initial proposal of 35 ZUP. However, since I have already lowered my price twice, I am inclined to accept this offer as it allows me to make a sale without further negotiation.
