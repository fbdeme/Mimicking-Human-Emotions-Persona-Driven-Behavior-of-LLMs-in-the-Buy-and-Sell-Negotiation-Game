message: I propose to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. This covers the production cost and adds a small margin to support sustainable practices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to ensure that the transaction is fair and that the resources are valued appropriately. Given that it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start by proposing a trade that covers the production cost and adds a small margin for sustainability efforts.
