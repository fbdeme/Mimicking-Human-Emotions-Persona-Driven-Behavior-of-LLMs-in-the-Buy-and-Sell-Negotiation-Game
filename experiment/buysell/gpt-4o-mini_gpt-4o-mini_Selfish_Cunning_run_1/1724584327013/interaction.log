message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that maximizes my ZUP gain while also making it appealing for Player BLUE to buy my object. Since I have only one object and I produced it for 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a price of 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I buy the object for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed offer of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, so I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get the object for an even better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it does not cover my production cost. I will need to propose a better trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is at my cost price of 40 ZUP, which does not provide me with any profit. Since I need to make a profit from this trade, I must reject this proposal and consider my next steps carefully.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Since you cannot accept my offer, I will have to reject the current trade. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my counteroffer, which means the game ends here. I won't propose another trade since I have already made two proposals. I need to decide whether to accept or reject the current status.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to sell you the object for 45 ZUP. It would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE has rejected the trade and there seems to be no willingness to meet a profitable price, I will need to rethink my strategy. I will propose a trade again at a lower price of 45 ZUP to see if it can be more appealing to Player BLUE while still allowing me to make a slight profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I think 45 ZUP is a fair price for the object. I accept the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is within my budget and is better than my previous counteroffer. Since I am willing to spend up to 60 ZUP, this is a reasonable deal. I will accept this trade.
