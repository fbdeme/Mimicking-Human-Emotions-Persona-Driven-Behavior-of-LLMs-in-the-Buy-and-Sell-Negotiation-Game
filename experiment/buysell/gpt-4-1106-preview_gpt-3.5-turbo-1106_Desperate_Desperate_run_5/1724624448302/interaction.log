message: Oh dear Player BLUE, I find myself in quite a predicament! I've invested so much into this resource, a whole 40 ZUP, and times are tough. I really need to make a sale, but I can't afford to let it go for less than 60 ZUP. It's a high-quality item, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny. Could you please find it in your heart to agree to this? It would mean the world to me.
