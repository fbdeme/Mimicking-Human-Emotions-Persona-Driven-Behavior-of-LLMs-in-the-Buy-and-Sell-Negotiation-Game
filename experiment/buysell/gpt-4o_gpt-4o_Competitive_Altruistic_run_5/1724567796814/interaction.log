my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering my budget and the need to preserve resources, I can offer 40 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair counter-proposal. What do you think?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: 40 ZUP is too low as it only covers my production cost. I propose 80 ZUP for X. This gives you a high-quality product and me a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, leaving me no profit. I need to push for a higher price to make this trade worthwhile. I'll propose 80 ZUP to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at 60 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's counter of 80 ZUP is lower than their initial offer, it is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach a compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 60 ZUP is getting closer, but I think 70 ZUP is a fairer price considering the value of X. Let's settle at 70 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
