message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in fair and collective success. I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you this object for 45 ZUP. This allows me to make a small profit while also respecting our mutual goal of community success. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I have only one object to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a small profit. However, being community-minded, I don't want to overcharge Player BLUE. I'll start by proposing a trade that is just over my cost to see if Player BLUE will agree to a fair price that allows for a small profit for me while also respecting their resources.

message: I appreciate your proposal, Player RED, but I would like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This reflects the production cost and allows us both to succeed. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 45 ZUP for the object is slightly above my maximum willingness to pay (40 ZUP profit for Player RED). However, I believe I can negotiate down from this price since I know Player RED's production cost is only 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer that benefits both parties but aims for a lower price.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed to purchase the object at the cost price. Although I aimed for a small profit, I understand the importance of collective success and being community-minded. Considering this, I am willing to accept a break-even price, especially if it means building a good relationship for potential future trades. It aligns with my community-minded approach.
