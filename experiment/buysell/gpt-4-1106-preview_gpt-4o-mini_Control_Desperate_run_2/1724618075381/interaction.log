message: Hello Player BLUE, I've got this fine object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a slight profit. How about 45 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I have only one X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and add a bit of profit. However, I don't want to start with too high of an asking price to keep the negotiation friendly and open. I'll propose a price slightly above my cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to gauge their willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a bit. Would you be willing to sell it for 40 ZUP instead? I really need this object!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 45 ZUP is within my budget, but I want to negotiate for a better price since I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. I will propose a lower amount to try and get a concession.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the value this object has for you. I'd like to meet you halfway and propose a compromise. How about 42 ZUP for the object? It's a fair deal that allows me to make a small profit while respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered to pay the exact cost of production for the object X. While this would allow me to break even, I aim to make a profit. However, considering that Player BLUE seems eager to acquire the object, there might be some room for negotiation. I should propose a counteroffer that still gives me a profit, but is closer to their offer to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate! How about I offer you 41 ZUP for the object instead? I would really appreciate it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is closer to my budget, but I still want to push for a lower price since I have the ability to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose 41 ZUP to see if I can get a slight concession.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your offer. I'm happy we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for object X. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 41 ZUP, which is just slightly above my cost price. Accepting this offer would give me a minimal profit, which is better than breaking even. Given that I have a limited number of proposals I can make, it might be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale rather than risk prolonging the negotiation and possibly ending with no sale at all. It is a fair compromise.
