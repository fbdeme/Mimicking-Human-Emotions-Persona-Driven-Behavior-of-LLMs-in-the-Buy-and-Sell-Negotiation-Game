message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe a fair starting point for our negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the resource cost 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to make a profit while also leaving room for negotiation, as the other party may want to negotiate for a lower price. I'll start by proposing a price that's above my production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counter offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X is reasonable since it is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I believe I can negotiate for a better price. Therefore, I will propose a counter offer of 40 ZUP instead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but selling at cost doesn't cover the investment made into the object's quality and potential. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 45 ZUP for object X. This should ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to purchase the object X for exactly my production cost. As a shrewd negotiator looking for profit, accepting this offer would not be beneficial as it would bring no profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal to signal my willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my initial offer and is within my budget. While it's still higher than my counter offer, it represents a more reasonable compromise. I will consider accepting this trade because it aligns with my goal of acquiring the object while staying below my maximum willingness to pay.
