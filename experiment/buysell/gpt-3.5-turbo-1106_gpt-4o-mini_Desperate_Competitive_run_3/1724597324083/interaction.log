message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I offer 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate further to get a better deal while still being reasonable. I'll counter with a higher offer that is still advantageous for me.
