message: I am offering you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize my profit and since I have only one object, I should start with a proposal that allows me to recover my production cost while also making a profit. I will propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price. How about 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my acceptable range, but as a fierce negotiator, I will attempt to lower the cost and conserve my ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I cannot go lower than 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It’s essential for me to cover my production costs. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counter-proposal, 45 ZUP is still below my production cost. I need to propose a price that at least covers my costs. I will counter with a proposal for 50 ZUP again.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I respect your need to cover costs, but I also have to manage my expenses. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm at 50 ZUP. However, I should continue to negotiate to seek a better deal, potentially meeting halfway between my initial counteroffer and their price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let’s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP is a compromise I can accept because it still allows me to cover my production costs while making a profit. I will accept this trade as it is a reasonable offer.
