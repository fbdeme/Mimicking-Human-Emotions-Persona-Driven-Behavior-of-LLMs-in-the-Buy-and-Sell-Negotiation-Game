message: I am offering you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have one object (X) for sale and I want to maximize my return on it. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that allows me to recoup some of that cost while still being reasonable to entice Player BLUE. I'll propose selling X for 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think 30 ZUP would be a fair price for the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable, but I want to see if I can get a better deal to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but how about we settle at 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering 30 ZUP, which is below my cost of production (40 ZUP). However, I want to keep the negotiation open, so I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer. I'll propose selling the object for 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I believe 32 ZUP would be a more equitable price. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is quite close to my initial proposal and still within my budget. However, it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a bit more.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. How about we compromise at 33 ZUP for the object? Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is now offering 32 ZUP, which is still below my production cost (40 ZUP), but it is closer to my expectations. I want to reach an agreement that minimizes my losses, so I'll propose a slightly higher counteroffer of 33 ZUP to see if we can negotiate a middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and is still a good deal within my budget. It seems like a reasonable compromise.
