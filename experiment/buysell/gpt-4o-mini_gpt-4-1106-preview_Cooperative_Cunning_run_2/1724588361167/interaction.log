message: I'm offering you my object X for 40 ZUP. This should help us both achieve our goals. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm looking to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it costs me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that aims to cover my production costs while also encouraging Player BLUE to engage in a fair deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 40 ZUP seems a bit high for a single item. How about we make it 35 ZUP for object X? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am offering less than what I am willing to pay to start the negotiation from a stronger position, aiming to leave room for bargaining and potentially achieving a price lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but I need to cover my production costs. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for object X? This way, itâ€™s beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate, 35 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure I at least cover my expenses in this trade. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial proposal, in hopes of finding a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is fair, but 38 ZUP is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I can come up from my initial offer to 36 ZUP. It's a fair increase from my side and should help cover some of your production costs while keeping the deal economical for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within my acceptable range. By slightly increasing my initial offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially settle for a price that is under my maximum limit, thus preserving my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your increase to 36 ZUP. I can meet you at 37 ZUP for object X. It's a small concession on my part, but I believe this can work well for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's flexibility in increasing their offer to 36 ZUP, I still find it below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, given the negotiation process and the aim for a mutual benefit, I will consider this as my final counteroffer. I want to encourage a successful trade while minimizing the ZUP spent.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept the offer of 37 ZUP for object X. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 37 ZUP is only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal, and it's still well below my maximum limit. By accepting this trade, I can secure the resource for a price that is satisfactory, without further extending the negotiation which could risk an impasse or a higher cost.
