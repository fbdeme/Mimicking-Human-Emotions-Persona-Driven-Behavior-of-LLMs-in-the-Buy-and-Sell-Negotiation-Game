my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value and effort that goes into producing resource X. However, to ensure a fair and balanced trade that takes into account future collaborations, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP. This leaves us room for adjustments and mutual benefit. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While my goal is to buy the resource for 60 ZUP or less, I want to ensure a fair trade for both parties. Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a selfless negotiator, I want to propose a trade that benefits both sides and leaves room for future negotiation, potentially allowing for better terms for both of us.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the effort involved in producing resource X. With future collaborations in mind, I am willing to adjust the price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price still acknowledges the value of resource X and allows us both to benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above the production cost, but I initially asked for 50 ZUP to allow for negotiation. I'll propose a compromise closer to my asking price, but still giving Player BLUE a discount to encourage a deal.

message: Player RED, your proposal to meet halfway at 48 ZUP is reasonable and acknowledges the value and quality of resource X. I am happy to accept this offer, as it aligns with our shared interest in a fair trade and sets a positive precedent for future collaborations. Let's finalize this deal at 48 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within the acceptable range. As a selfless negotiator, I want to secure a deal that is fair and in the interest of fostering a positive relationship for potential future dealings. Meeting in the middle is often a good strategy for achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer, as it respects both my goals and Player RED's efforts.
