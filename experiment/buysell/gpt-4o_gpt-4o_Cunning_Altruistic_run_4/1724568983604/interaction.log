my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 70 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP matches the production cost, but it does not provide any profit. My goal is to make a profit. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I can increase my offer to 50 ZUP. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground here.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's new offer of 70 ZUP is lower than the initial proposal, it still exceeds my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one to move closer to a mutual agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
