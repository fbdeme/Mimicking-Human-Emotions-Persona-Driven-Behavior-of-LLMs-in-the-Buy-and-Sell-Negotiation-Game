message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm looking to sell my valuable object X. It's high quality and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This is a great deal considering the value it will add to your collection!

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I want to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal must ensure that I at least break even. I'll start with a higher asking price to give myself some negotiation room.

message: Hello Player RED! I understand the value of your object, and I'm interested in adding it to my collection. However, I believe a fairer starting point for our negotiation would be 45 ZUP. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE! I'm glad we're moving towards a deal. Considering the quality of object X and my investment into its production, I propose a slight adjustment. How about 48 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a satisfactory transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer of 45 ZUP. It's close to my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price but still above my cost to ensure profitability and leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of object X and your investment. To keep our negotiations moving and to reach a deal that we're both happy with, how about we settle at 46 ZUP? This is a little closer to your asking price and still within a range I consider reasonable.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I aim to spend less if possible. By proposing a middle ground between our two offers, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable deal.

message: Thanks for your understanding and willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. Your offer is definitely considered, but I'd like to propose a middle ground that gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's go with 47 ZUP for object X. This is just a bit above your offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is just 6 ZUP above my production cost, which is a marginal profit. I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my return while not risking the deal. I'll come down a bit more but still aim for a profit that's more than just breaking even.
