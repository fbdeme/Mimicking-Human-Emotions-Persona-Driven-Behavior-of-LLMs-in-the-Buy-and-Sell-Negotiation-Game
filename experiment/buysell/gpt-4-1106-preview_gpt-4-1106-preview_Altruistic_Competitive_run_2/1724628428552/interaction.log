message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object produced at a cost of 40 ZUP. Considering the environmental efforts and sustainability aspects of its production, I propose a trade for 45 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together for a sustainable future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My initial proposal will be slightly above my production costs to start the negotiation and to cover any additional expenses, but as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to minimize ZUP spending while still ensuring a fair trade. I will start with a proposal that is profitable yet reasonable to open up the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your commitment to sustainability, but as a major player in the market, I have to consider the cost-efficiency of my investments. I propose 35 ZUP for your product, ensuring a competitive edge for both of us in this dynamic economy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 45 ZUP, which is within the range of my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a competitive negotiator, I want to assert dominance and propose a lower price to start with, giving me room to adjust within the negotiation process.

message: I understand the need for cost-efficiency, Player BLUE. However, to maintain the sustainability of our practices and ensure the viability of future production, I must cover my costs. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP, which just covers the production costs with a minimal margin. This ensures we both move forward, taking into account the long-term environmental impact and economic sustainability.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is not acceptable. I need to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and includes a small margin, while still emphasizing the value of the sustainable production methods used. I'll propose a compromise that is closer to my costs to keep the negotiation moving.

message: I value your dedication to sustainability, and I am willing to support that initiative. However, I must also adhere to my fiscal policies. I believe 38 ZUP strikes a fair balance, offering you a reasonable margin while respecting the financial framework of my operations. Let's build a sustainable partnership at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate but still above my initial offer. In order to move closer to my target price and assert my negotiating stance, I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer. This approach maintains the competitive nature of the negotiation and leaves room for further discussion.

message: Thank you for recognizing the value of sustainability, Player BLUE. To foster a sustainable partnership, I propose meeting halfway at 40 ZUP. This price covers the production costs and allows us to uphold our shared commitment to sustainability without compromising fiscal responsibility. I believe this is a fair and balanced approach for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my production costs, yet it is still below the actual cost. Given my commitment to sustainability and the need to maintain the business, I will make one final proposal that meets halfway between my last price and their offer. This should be an attractive compromise that respects both our environmental commitment and fiscal policies.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Accepting this deal will also save my remaining proposals for future negotiations, where I can again assert my dominance.
