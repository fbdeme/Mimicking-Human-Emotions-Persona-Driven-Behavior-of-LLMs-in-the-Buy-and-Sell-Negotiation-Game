Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X is at the maximum limit I am willing to pay. However, since the seller has produced the item for 40 ZUP, I believe there is room for negotiation. I will counter with a lower offer to attempt to reduce my expenditure.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 50 ZUP. I propose we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this is fair considering the production cost and the value of the resource.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I would like to make another counteroffer of 52 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The revised offer of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, and it seems reasonable given the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I still feel that 55 ZUP is slightly higher than I would like to pay. I will counter with a more favorable offer for me to keep pushing for a lower price.
