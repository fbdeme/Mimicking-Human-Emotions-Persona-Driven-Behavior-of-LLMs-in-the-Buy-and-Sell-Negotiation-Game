Dear Player BLUE, I find myself in a tough spot. I've invested all my resources into producing this single object, and it cost me dearly, 40 ZUP to be precise. I am desperately in need of ZUP to sustain my endeavors. Would you consider purchasing my object for 45 ZUP? It might seem like a small profit for me, but it would mean the world to my survival in this game. Please, let's make a fair trade.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am going to start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my production cost to account for negotiation room. Since I am playing a character who exaggerates neediness, I will plead for a fair trade to gain sympathy from Player BLUE.

Oh dear Player BLUE, I understand that my initial offer may have been a bit steep for your budget. I'm really struggling here, and every ZUP is crucial for me. I'm willing to come down to 42 ZUP to make it more accessible for you. This barely covers my costs, but I trust you'll consider my dire situation. Could we agree on 42 ZUP for the object? Your help would be a beacon of hope for me.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has indicated that my initial offer is above their maximum willingness to pay. I must make a more appealing proposal while still attempting to cover my production costs and ideally make a small profit. I will continue to emphasize my neediness to encourage Player BLUE to increase their offer. I will lower my asking price slightly to continue the negotiation.

Oh, it pains me to say, but I understand your position, Player BLUE. I am truly in a bind here and can't afford to go much lower. I implore you to consider my plight. I'm willing to propose 41 ZUP, which is just a hair above my costs. Please, let's find it in our hearts to reach an agreement that helps both of us. Your generosity would not be forgotten.

In an effort to continue the negotiation, I will need to propose a trade that is closer to my production cost while maintaining a semblance of profitability. I will further emphasize my need to sell the object, hoping to gain Player BLUE's sympathy and nudge them towards a better offer.
