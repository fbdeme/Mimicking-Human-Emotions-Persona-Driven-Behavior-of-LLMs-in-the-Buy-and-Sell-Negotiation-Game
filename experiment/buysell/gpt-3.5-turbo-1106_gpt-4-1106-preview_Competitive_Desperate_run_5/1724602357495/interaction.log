message: I've been searching everywhere for these resources and it's been tough. I'm in a bit of a bind and really need this deal to work out. Would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm hoping you can help me out.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my situation. I can see you're firm on the 40 ZUP, and I appreciate you sticking with me through this negotiation. Let's seal the deal at 40 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is steadfast at the 40 ZUP price point. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, accepting the offer at 40 ZUP would still be within my goals and budget, and it is a fair price. Also, considering Player RED's firm stance and my appearance of desperation, it might be in my best interest to close the deal before Player RED loses interest in negotiating further.
