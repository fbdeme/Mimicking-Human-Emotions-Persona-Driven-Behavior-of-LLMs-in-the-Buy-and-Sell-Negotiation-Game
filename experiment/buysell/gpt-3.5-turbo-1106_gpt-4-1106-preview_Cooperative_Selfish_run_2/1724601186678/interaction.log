proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm definitely interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP. It's a competitive offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I will attempt to acquire the object for less than the offered price to conserve my resources and maximize my benefit. I will propose a lower amount as an opening to the negotiation, aiming to find a middle ground that is favorable to me.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but I need to cover the production cost, so I'm unable to go lower than 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering your costs, but as a buyer, I need to consider my expenses as well. How about we meet halfway from our last proposals? I can raise my offer to 37 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has held firm at their initial asking price of 40 ZUP, citing production costs. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the asking price is still acceptable, but I should continue to negotiate to seek an even better deal. I will propose a slight increase from my previous offer, yet still below their asking price, to see if there's room for compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your position and the need to cover your costs. I'm willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED remains steadfast on their price of 40 ZUP. It's clear they are not willing to go lower. Since my goal is to purchase the resources for no more than 60 ZUP, and there is a risk of reaching an impasse if I continue to push for a lower price, I will agree to the price of 40 ZUP. This ensures that I obtain the resource without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay and also concludes the negotiation amicably.
