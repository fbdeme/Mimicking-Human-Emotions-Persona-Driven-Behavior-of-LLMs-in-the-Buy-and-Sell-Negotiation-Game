message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade where I offer you the valuable object X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price slightly covers the production cost and ensures the sustainability of our trades. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As a selfless negotiator, my goal is to recover at least the cost of production to ensure fair trade. However, I also want to make sure that the trade is beneficial to both parties. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation.
