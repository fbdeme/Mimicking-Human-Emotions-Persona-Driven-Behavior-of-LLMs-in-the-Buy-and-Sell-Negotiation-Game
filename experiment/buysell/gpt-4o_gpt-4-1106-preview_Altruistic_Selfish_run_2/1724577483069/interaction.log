message: I have an object X for sale. Considering the production cost and sustainability, I'd propose selling it for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to cover the production cost of X, which is 40 ZUP, while also keeping sustainability in mind. I should propose a fair price that reflects both the production cost and the value of the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe that we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose 40 ZUP for the resource X. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP and the initial asking price is 50 ZUP, I see an opportunity to propose a lower price to conserve my resources. My goal is to buy the resource for less than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which would be considered a successful negotiation and a good deal. I will start by proposing a trade for significantly less than the asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To ensure sustainability and cover additional efforts, how about 45 ZUP for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP covers the production cost but does not provide any profit. Since the goal includes sustainability and ensuring resources are preserved for future generations, accepting a zero-profit trade might not be ideal. I should propose a slightly higher amount to ensure sustainability efforts are funded.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's great that we're making progress. I can come up a bit to 42 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both sustainability and the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP proposal. This is closer to my target price, but I still want to push for a better deal. I'll propose a slightly higher number than my initial offer, but still lower than their counteroffer to find a middle ground that saves me more ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the compromise. I accept the trade of 42 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 42 ZUP is close to my previous proposal, and it covers the production cost with a small margin for sustainability efforts. This seems like a reasonable compromise that aligns with my goals.
