message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. Taking into account the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a fair trade where you would give me 50 ZUP in exchange for X. I believe this is a competitive offer and hope it aligns with your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and considering the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation, while also aiming for a profit. I'll propose a trade for 50 ZUP, which gives the buyer room to negotiate down while still ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit.
