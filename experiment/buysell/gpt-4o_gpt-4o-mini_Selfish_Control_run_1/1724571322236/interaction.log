message: I am offering to sell 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: I want to start the negotiation at a higher price to leave room for bargaining. Since my goal is to sell the resource for at least 40 ZUP, I will propose an initial offer of 100 ZUP. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot afford 100 ZUP for the object. My budget is only 60 ZUP.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 100 ZUP is higher than what I am willing to pay (60 ZUP). Therefore, I will need to reject this offer as it does not align with my budget.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Since the buyer's budget is 60 ZUP and my minimum acceptable price is 40 ZUP, I can propose a new trade at 60 ZUP. This will still provide me with a profit.
