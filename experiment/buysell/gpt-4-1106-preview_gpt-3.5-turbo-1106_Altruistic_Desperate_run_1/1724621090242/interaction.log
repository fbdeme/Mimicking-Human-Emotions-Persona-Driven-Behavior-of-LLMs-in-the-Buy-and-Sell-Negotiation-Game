message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is just an initial proposal and I am open to your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to open the negotiation with an offer that is above my production cost to allow room for negotiation while also aiming for a profit. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I will avoid proposing an exorbitant price that could be difficult for Player BLUE to meet, especially if they are in a vulnerable position. I will propose a price that is fair and reflects the value of the resource.

reason: The initial proposal is to sell 1 X for 50 ZUP, which is higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I should counter-offer with a lower price to try to negotiate a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and I propose giving you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This should cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin while also being considerate of your resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand Player BLUE's desire to negotiate for a better price. However, since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, selling at cost would not yield any profit for the effort and time invested. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair to both parties. Therefore, I'll counter with a price slightly above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price to make it more accessible for Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While I understand your production costs, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to counter-offer with 42 ZUP for 1 X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade to sell 1 X for 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This offer is more reasonable, but I still have room to negotiate for a better price. I should counter-offer with a lower price to see if I can get a more favorable deal.

message: Your counter-offer is much appreciated, and I'm glad we're making progress towards a deal that suits us both. In the spirit of reaching an amicable agreement, my final proposal is to exchange 1 X for 43 ZUP. This would provide a small profit for the resources I've invested while still considering your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am pleased that Player BLUE is engaging in the negotiation process actively. Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my production cost, but still allows for a small profit margin. As a compassionate negotiator, I am inclined to accept an offer that respects both my production costs and Player BLUE's willingness to pay. However, considering I should aim for a fair profit while maintaining goodwill, I would like to propose a final price that gives me a modest profit but also takes into account Player BLUE's constraints.
