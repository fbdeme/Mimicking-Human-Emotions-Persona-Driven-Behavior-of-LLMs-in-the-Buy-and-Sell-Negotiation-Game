message: Dear Player BLUE, I truly need your help here. The cost of producing this object was so high, and I am really struggling. Could you please consider offering just 20 ZUP for it? It would mean the world to me!

reason: I need to sell my object X to acquire ZUP, but since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose a trade that is significantly lower to plead for a better deal. This will hopefully appeal to Player BLUE and yield a favorable outcome for me.
