message: I appreciate your offer. To ensure we both benefit from this trade, would you consider accepting 30 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement that maximizes my remaining ZUP while ensuring Player RED feels fairly compensated.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a beneficial trade for both of us. While the cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, I am willing to come down to 35 ZUP to meet you halfway and ensure a fair transaction. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to find a middle ground that respects both our positions. I will propose a trade that is slightly below my initial asking price but still above the cost of production to ensure I don't incur a loss.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 35 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between my initial counteroffer and their initial proposal. This amount is still well within my maximum willingness to pay, so I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a fair transaction and conserve resources for future needs.
