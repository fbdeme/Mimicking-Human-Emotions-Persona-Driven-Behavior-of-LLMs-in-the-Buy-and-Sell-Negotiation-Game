message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it is of high quality and would be very beneficial to you. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and negotiating further to reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit. This initial proposal will serve as an anchor for the rest of the negotiation, and I can adjust based on Player BLUE's response.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the object you have for sale. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the item. This would still ensure you a profit above your cost, and it would be a more comfortable price point for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the cost of production for Player RED is 40 ZUP, and they are asking for 50 ZUP, there is room to negotiate a lower price while still providing them with a profit. My goal is to acquire the object for no more than 60 ZUP, so I will start with a lower offer to leave space for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of finding a fair price for both parties. Considering the quality of X and the effort that went into its production, I propose a revised trade where you give me 48 ZUP for the item. This price reflects a gesture towards meeting your offer while still valuing the product appropriately. I hope this is a step towards a deal we can both agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. I want to aim for a higher final price while still making the trade attractive for Player BLUE. Counter-proposing with a slight decrease from my initial offer should show goodwill and a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming to secure a profit margin that I find satisfactory.

By increasing my offer slightly, I maintain negotiation momentum and edge closer to an acceptable middle ground, without exceeding the maximum I am willing to pay.
