message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes a modest profit for me, but I'm willing to discuss the terms further to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to sell it at a price that covers my costs and provides me with a bit of profit. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the deal is fair and doesn't put an undue burden on Player BLUE. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing a trade where they give 1 object for 50 ZUP. This is higher than the maximum price I am willing to pay, so I should counteroffer with a lower price.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer and for sharing your maximum price point. To meet in the middle and considering the well-being of both parties, I propose selling the object for 48 ZUP. This gives me a slight profit margin while staying comfortably below your maximum willingness to pay. I hope this proposal is seen as fair and reasonable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost. They proposed 45 ZUP, which is just above my cost price. Considering my compassionate approach and the goal to ensure fairness, I will counter-propose with a price that gives me a modest profit while still being under their maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand your desire for a profit margin. However, I believe 46 ZUP is a fairer price for the object.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a new proposal of selling the object for 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. This offer includes a slight profit margin for them, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I should counteroffer with a lower price to try to reach a more favorable agreement.
