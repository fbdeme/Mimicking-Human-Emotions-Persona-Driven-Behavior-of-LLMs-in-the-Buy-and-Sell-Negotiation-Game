message: 
To ensure a fair and sustainable trade, I propose to sell you my resource X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin to continue sustainable practices. I am open to discussing the terms to reach an agreement that aligns with our environmental goals.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I aim to recover at least the cost of production while also considering the sustainability aspect. I will start with a proposal slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation and to find a balance between fair compensation and minimizing ZUP expenditure.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the sustainability goals, I believe we can find a more favorable price for both of us. I propose a price of 35 ZUP for the resource X. This allows us to establish a long-term relationship where we can continue to do business with mutual benefits in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a calculating negotiator, my aim is to acquire the resource at the lowest possible cost to maximize my personal gain. I will counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate the price down further.

message: 
I understand the desire for a more favorable price and the importance of our long-term relationship. However, the cost of producing the resource X was 40 ZUP, and it is important that the selling price reflects the sustainability efforts invested. I propose a revised price of 42 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counter. This price covers the production cost and supports the continuation of sustainable practices.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost. As a sustainability-minded seller, I cannot accept a price that fails to cover the cost of production, as it would undermine the ability to maintain sustainable practices. I need to make a counteroffer that at least covers my costs and allows for the continuation of environmentally friendly operations. Therefore, I will propose a price that meets us in the middle, still reflecting the importance of sustainability.

message: I understand your position on covering production costs and the value of sustainability. I believe that we are close to a deal. Let's meet in the middle from where we started and where we are now. I propose a price of 38 ZUP for resource X, which should fairly reflect both the production costs and the sustainability aspect, while also considering future transactions between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 42 ZUP, stating that their production cost is 40 ZUP. Although this is still within my budget, I will attempt to negotiate further for a better deal, aiming to preserve my resources while still closing the transaction. I will propose a price that's slightly higher than my last offer but still below their revised price, to keep the negotiation momentum going.

message: 
Thank you for your understanding of the sustainability aspect and your willingness to approach a fair deal. To ensure the sustainability of my operations, I propose a final price of 40 ZUP for resource X. This price matches the production cost and is essential for maintaining environmentally friendly practices. I believe this is a fair and just proposal that will enable us to have a sustainable long-term relationship.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The new proposal of 38 ZUP is still below the production cost, but it is closer to a sustainable and reasonable agreement. However, selling at this price would mean incurring a loss, which could compromise my ability to maintain sustainable practices. A trade at the cost of production would be the minimum acceptable deal. To reach a conclusion that ensures the viability of my sustainability efforts, I will make one final proposal that equals my production cost, highlighting the importance of covering these costs to ensure future sustainable operations.

Turn: 1
message: I respect your commitment to sustainability and your transparent pricing. The price of 40 ZUP for resource X is agreeable, and I believe it establishes a fair foundation for our long-term relationship. I accept your proposal, and I look forward to future transactions with this same spirit of fairness and sustainability.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a final price of 40 ZUP, which matches their stated production cost and is within my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a fair price that allows for the sustainability of their operations and is within my budget, there is little benefit in continuing to negotiate for a lower price. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable cost and help in establishing a sustainable long-term business relationship with Player RED.
