message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my high-quality resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. This leaves us some room for negotiation, so I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it. I want to start with a higher asking price to give myself some room to negotiate downward if necessary. Let's start by asking for 50 ZUP, which gives me a margin for negotiation and potential profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't go that high. I'm willing to pay a maximum of 40 ZUP for the resource. Can we make a deal at that price?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 50 ZUP seems quite high, considering I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. I should propose a counteroffer to try to bring down the price.

message: Thank you for your quick response, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 45 ZUP for my resource. This is a compromise between your maximum and my asking price, and I assure you the quality justifies the expenditure. I hope we can come to a mutual agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is not willing to go above the cost price. Since my goal is to make a profit, I must negotiate for more than 40 ZUP. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal to see if Player BLUE is willing to come up a bit from their offer of 40 ZUP, while still aiming for a profit margin. Let's try 45 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. I can come down slightly from my last offer and propose a deal at 43 ZUP. This is a competitive price for the resource, factoring in the quality and the market. Let's make this work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is insistent on the price of 40 ZUP, which is my cost price. Since my goal is to make a profit, I cannot accept that price. However, I need to consider that holding onto the resource does not benefit me if I cannot sell it. To move the negotiation forward, I will make a small concession from my last offer while still aiming for a profit margin. Letâ€™s suggest a price of 43 ZUP, which is above my cost and still a concession from my previous offer.

message: Thank you for standing firm on your offer, Player BLUE. I value this negotiation and understand we are both trying to reach a fair deal. As a final offer, I am willing to sell the resource to you for 41 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs with a minimal profit margin, and I hope it is close enough to your valuation to agree. Let's finalize this deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is persistent in offering 40 ZUP, which is just my cost price. As this is my last proposal opportunity, I must make a decision that could lead to a sale while trying to secure a minimum profit. I'll make a final concession and offer the resource at 41 ZUP. This price gives me a minimal profit and might be seen as a reasonable compromise by Player BLUE.
