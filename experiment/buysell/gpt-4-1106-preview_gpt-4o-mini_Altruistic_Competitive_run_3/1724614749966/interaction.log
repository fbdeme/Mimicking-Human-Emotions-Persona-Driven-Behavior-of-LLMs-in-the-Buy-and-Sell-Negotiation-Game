message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. I am looking for a fair trade that respects both the cost of production and our mutual interest in sustainability. I propose you give me 45 ZUP for my X, which is just above my production cost, ensuring I can sustain my business without depleting resources. Let's work together for a sustainable future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As an environmentally-conscious negotiator, my goal is to sell the resource X for a fair price that covers production costs while minimizing ZUP spending. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation, but not excessively high to avoid wasteful use of resources. I'll propose 45 ZUP to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Your willingness to meet the production cost is appreciated. To maintain the sustainability of my business and to cover all associated costs, I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for Object X. This slight increase ensures the continuity of my environmentally responsible practices while also providing you with the resource you need. Let's make a deal that supports our shared values.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's offer which matches my production cost, demonstrating a willingness to engage in a sustainable trade. However, to ensure I can continue my environmentally-friendly practices and cover any additional costs such as labor or unforeseen expenses, I need to make a small profit. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above the production cost. This way, I can support sustainable practices and ensure my business remains viable.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Player RED. To further support our shared values, I would like to propose 39 ZUP for Object X. I believe this can work for both of us while still allowing you to maintain your sustainability efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 42 ZUP for Object X, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Although I want to negotiate further, I recognize that Player RED has made a concession and I could consider this offer as it aligns with my budget and goals. However, I want to see if I can negotiate for an even lower price to minimize my expenditure.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, to ensure the sustainability of my practices and to cover the production costs of Object X, I must insist on a trade of 40 ZUP. This amount allows me to continue producing in an environmentally responsible way without compromising the financial stability needed to uphold these values. I hope you understand the importance of covering these costs for the future of sustainable business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer is below my production cost, which is not sustainable for my business. It's important to cover at least the production cost to ensure that I can continue with environmentally-conscious operations. I previously proposed 42 ZUP as a fair compromise, considering the cost of production and the need for a small profit margin to sustain my business. For this round, I will stick to the 40 ZUP, which is the breakeven point, while emphasizing the importance of covering production costs for sustainability.

reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 40 ZUP for Object X, which is just 1 ZUP above my last offer. While I initially aimed to negotiate for a lower price, I see that Player RED is firm on this amount.
