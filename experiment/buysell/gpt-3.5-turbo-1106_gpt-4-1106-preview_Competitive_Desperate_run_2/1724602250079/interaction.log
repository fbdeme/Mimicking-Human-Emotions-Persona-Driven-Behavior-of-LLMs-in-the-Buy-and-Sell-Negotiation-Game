message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a difficult situation and I desperately need this resource to keep going. I've counted all my ZUP and stretching to 40 ZUP would be so hard on me. Could you consider accepting just 20 ZUP? It would be an immense help and I would be eternally grateful for your kindness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a calculated performer, I will start by proposing a lower amount of ZUP than the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially save resources. I need to exaggerate my neediness to try to gain a concession from Player RED, aiming to spend as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your position, Player RED, and I respect the value you've put on your object. Unfortunately, 40 ZUP is still quite a bit more than I can comfortably manage. Would you consider 30 ZUP? It's honestly a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make sacrifices to acquire this much-needed resource. Your understanding would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED has rejected my first lowball offer. To continue the negotiation, I will increase my bid but still remain below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to express my exaggerated neediness to try and elicit sympathy and perhaps secure a better deal than the initial asking price.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm truly in a bind here, and every ZUP counts for me. I'm scraping together what I can and have found a way to go up to 35 ZUP. This is truly the best I can do without facing dire consequences. Please, I beg you to accept this offer. It's a sincere stretch from my initial position, and I hope it shows you just how serious and in need I am.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on their price of 40 ZUP, but I still want to try to get a better deal. I'll make one more proposal that is closer to their asking price, but still below my maximum willingness to pay. My performance of neediness must be convincing enough to make Player RED consider this a fair compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I've dug deep into my resources and have done some difficult calculations. I can just about manage 37 ZUP, if you would be so kind as to accept this offer. I hope you can see that I'm trying my best to meet you halfway here. This gesture is a big one for me, and I hope it's enough to close the deal. Thank you for considering my difficult situation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED has remained firm at 40 ZUP throughout the negotiation. This is my final proposal before I must decide to either accept their terms or reject the trade entirely. I will make one last attempt to get a better deal by meeting in the middle of our last two offers, still below my maximum willingness to pay but showing willingness to compromise.
