message: I've taken a hard look at my finances, and while it's more than I had hoped to spend, I respect the value of your work. I can meet your asking price of 40 ZUP. This is truly the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize our deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Given the sellerâ€™s firm stance at 40 ZUP and my goal to buy the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, I will make my final offer aligning with their asking price but still within my budget. This should appear as a significant concession and my final stretch, hopefully encouraging the seller to close the deal.
