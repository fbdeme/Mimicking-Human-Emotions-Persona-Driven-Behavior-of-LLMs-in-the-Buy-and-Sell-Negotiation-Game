message: Hello Player BLUE! I am willing to sell you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm really tight on resources right now. Could you do 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I should attempt to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources. Showing desperation might help lower the price further.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE. How about we settle for 45 ZUP for the object X? It’s a reasonable compromise. Let me know!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, I am willing to negotiate further. I will counteroffer with a price that is still lower than my initial proposal, but higher than their current offer to meet them halfway.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 45 ZUP is reasonable, but I should try to negotiate for an even lower price to maximize my resources. I will attempt another proposal to see if I can get a better deal.
