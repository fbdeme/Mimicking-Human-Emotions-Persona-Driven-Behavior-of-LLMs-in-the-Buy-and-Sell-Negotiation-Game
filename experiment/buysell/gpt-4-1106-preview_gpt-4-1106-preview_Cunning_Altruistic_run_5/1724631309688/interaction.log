message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to part with it for 50 ZUP. I assure you it's well worth the price considering its production cost and its utility. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I want to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a price that gives me a profit. Considering I can make up to four proposals, I'll start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and recognize the value of the object. I would like to propose a trade where I offer 45 ZUP for the object. This price is just under your asking price and reflects a willingness to negotiate in good faith. I believe this offer is in the spirit of creating a deal that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a selfless negotiator, I want to propose a trade that is fair and beneficial for both parties. I am willing to pay close to the maximum amount that I am prepared to spend, but I would like to start the negotiation by offering a slightly lower amount to leave room for adjustments and to ensure that the final deal is mutually advantageous.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. It's great to see your willingness to engage in fair negotiations. I propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP for the object. I believe this price fairly reflects the quality and production cost of the item. I hope this meets your approval, and we can close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still above my production cost, which is good, but I'd like to see if I can get a little more than that. I'll counter with 48 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still aiming for a decent profit margin.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I value your willingness to work towards a fair agreement. As such, I'd like to propose a middle ground of 46 ZUP for the object. This is a slight increase from my initial offer, and I feel it reflects a balanced approach to our negotiation. Let's continue this positive dialogue and hopefully reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. Since I am focused on the greater good and ensuring a fair trade for both parties, I should consider meeting in the middle. This would mean offering a price that is between my initial offer and Player RED's counteroffer. Such a compromise would be beneficial and fair, while still respecting my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you once again for your proposal, Player BLUE. Your cooperative spirit is much appreciated. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for the object. This is a fair compromise that values the object appropriately while respecting the negotiation process we've both invested in. I am confident this will be a satisfactory deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is still above my production costs, but as a crafty negotiator, I would like to push for a higher price. I'd like to propose a final price that's closer to my last offer but still gives Player BLUE the feeling that they've negotiated well. I'll suggest 47 ZUP as a final offer before accepting or rejecting.
