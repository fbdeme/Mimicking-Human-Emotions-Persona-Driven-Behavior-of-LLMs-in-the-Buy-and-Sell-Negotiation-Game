message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in collective success and fair trade. The resource I'm offering cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose that you give me 45 ZUP for it, allowing us both to benefit from this deal. Looking forward to a collaborative negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to ensure that both parties benefit from the trade. Considering the cost of production and the need for a fair trade, I will propose a starting price slightly higher than the production cost to allow for negotiation room.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to offer you 40 ZUP for the resource instead. This way we can both benefit while ensuring fair trade. I hope you consider my offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate Player RED's proposal and recognize the resource's value. However, I believe I can negotiate a better price, considering my willingness to pay is up to 60 ZUP and the cost of production was only 40 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer that is fair for both of us while still being within my budget.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your commitment to a fair trade. To meet halfway, I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP. This small margin above the production cost will help sustain the resource production, ensuring future trades can continue to benefit our community. Let's work together for mutual success.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production cost, which is fair, but as a community-minded negotiator, I aim to achieve a small margin to ensure the sustainability of the resource production. I will counter-propose with a reduced amount above my cost to find a middle ground.

player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and reflects a collaborative spirit.

Since 42 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, I will accept this offer.
