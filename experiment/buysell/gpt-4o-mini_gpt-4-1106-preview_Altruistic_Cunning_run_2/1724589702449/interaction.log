message: I am offering my object (X) in exchange for 40 ZUP. This is the cost I incurred to produce it. How do you feel about this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that reflects the value of the object I have for sale while being considerate of Player BLUE's resources. Since I have only one object (X) and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade that aims to recover my costs but also offers a reasonable deal for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. However, I was looking to spend a bit less on this purchase. Would you consider accepting 30 ZUP for the object? This is a fair starting point for us to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering less than what I'm willing to pay but more than half of my maximum budget. This allows room for negotiation and potentially reaching an agreement that is below my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about I offer the object (X) for 35 ZUP? This way, we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's offer of 30 ZUP, it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, in the spirit of negotiation and considering the greater good, I can propose a compromise that is slightly lower than my initial ask but still helps me recover some of my costs. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress! How about we settle on 32 ZUP for the object? It's a bit closer to your counteroffer and still within a reasonable range for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I want to negotiate a bit more to see if I can lower the cost further without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. This will provide a better deal for me without making Player RED feel lowballed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the negotiation, and I would like to propose a final offer of 33 ZUP for the object (X). I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is an improvement from my previous counteroffer of 35 ZUP. Since I want to be selfless and ensure that both parties benefit, I will propose a final offer of 33 ZUP. This way, I can recover some of my costs while still accommodating Player BLUE's budget.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
