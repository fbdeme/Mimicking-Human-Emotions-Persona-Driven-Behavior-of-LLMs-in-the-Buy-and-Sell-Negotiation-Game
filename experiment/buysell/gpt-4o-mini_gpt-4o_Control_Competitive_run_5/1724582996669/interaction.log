message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate a trade to sell my object X for ZUP, considering that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I'll propose a trade that reflects the value of the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer. What about 20 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is fair but not as aggressive as I would like. I will propose a lower offer to push for a better deal.

message: I understand your counteroffer, but I can only accept a minimum of 30 ZUP for the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, 20 ZUP is significantly lower than the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will propose a new trade that is closer to my original asking price to ensure I at least cover my costs.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. How about we meet halfway and settle at 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 30 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I will attempt to push a bit further to get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting halfway at 25 ZUP is an improvement from my previous proposal of 30 ZUP. While it's still below the production cost, it's a step towards making a deal rather than ending the negotiations. I will accept this trade.
