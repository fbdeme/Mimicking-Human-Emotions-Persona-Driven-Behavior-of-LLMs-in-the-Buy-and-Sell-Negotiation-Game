message: Dear Player BLUE, I believe in fostering collective success and would like to propose a trade that benefits us both. The resource I have for sale cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price allows me to recover my costs and ensures that I can continue to produce and contribute to our community. I'm open to your thoughts and willing to negotiate so that we can reach an agreement that serves the common goal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a community-minded negotiator, I want to propose a fair trade that allows me to recover the production costs of my resource while also being mindful of the collective success. Starting at a slightly higher price gives room for negotiation and can help us find a middle ground that satisfies both parties.

message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to negotiate the price a bit lower. How about I offer you 40 ZUP for the resource? This way, it still allows me to manage my resources effectively while I hope it serves our common goal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I still want to negotiate a better deal to minimize my expenditure. I will propose a lower amount but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation open.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to manage your resources effectively. The production cost of the resource is 40 ZUP, and while I seek to recover this cost, I also aim to sustain my ability to contribute to our community. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource, which is a compromise between your offer and my initial proposal. This small margin above cost ensures the longevity of resource production for our shared success. I'm hopeful we can meet in the middle and look forward to reaching an agreement that reflects our collective goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount it cost to produce the resource. While this allows me to break even, as a community-minded negotiator, I aim for a slight profit to ensure sustainability in contributing to our common goals. However, I want to respect Player BLUE's resources and find a middle ground that we both can agree upon. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is slightly above the production cost, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the resource, which I believe is a fair price that meets both our needs. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my previous offer and their original price. While this is an improvement from their initial proposal, I still believe I can negotiate further to lower my costs. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount of 42 ZUP, aiming to strike a balance while still being reasonable.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your willingness to meet me partway is greatly appreciated and speaks to the spirit of our community-minded approach. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource. This agreement allows us both to maintain our resources effectively and continue contributing to our shared goals. I look forward to our continued cooperation and collective success.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly from their initial offer, which is closer to my proposed 45 ZUP. Since my goal is to maintain the community's success while ensuring a small profit for sustainability, accepting 42 ZUP would allow me to achieve this with a modest profit margin. This should help in future production and contribution to our common goals. Given the negotiation process and our shared interests, I am inclined to accept this offer to maintain a positive relationship and further our collective success.
