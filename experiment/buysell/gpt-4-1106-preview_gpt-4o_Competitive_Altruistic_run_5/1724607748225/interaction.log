Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I must cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway; how does 45 ZUP sound for this exclusive item? This is a fair middle ground that ensures quality and value for your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which does not fulfill my goal of making a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to move towards a middle ground while still aiming for a profit margin.
