message: I am offering to sell X for 80 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation high to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a higher initial price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but 80 ZUP is a bit too high for me. How about 50 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is too high for me, as I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for X. I will propose a lower amount to see if we can reach a more agreeable price that supports both parties fairly.

message: I understand your position. How about 70 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost of 40 ZUP but still lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can get a bit more, so I will propose a slight reduction from my initial offer to meet in the middle.

reason: While 70 ZUP is closer to my maximum budget, it is still above my limit of 60 ZUP. I will propose a trade closer to my limit to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
