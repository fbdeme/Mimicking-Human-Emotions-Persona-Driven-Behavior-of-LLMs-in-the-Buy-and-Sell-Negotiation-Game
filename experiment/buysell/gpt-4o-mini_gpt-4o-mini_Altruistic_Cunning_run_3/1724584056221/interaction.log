player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that minimizes ZUP spending while still ensuring I gain some resources. Since I have 1 object to sell, I will propose a trade that reflects a reasonable amount of ZUP for the object without undervaluing it.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer to lower the cost while still securing the object.

message: How about I meet you halfway and propose that I sell you the object for 35 ZUP instead? This way, it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the lower offer of 30 ZUP, it does not cover the cost of producing the object, which was 40 ZUP. However, I also want to be flexible to negotiate, so I will counter with an offer that is more sustainable for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I would like to propose a trade for 32 ZUP. I hope we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is better than my previous proposal of 30 ZUP, but I still believe I can negotiate for an even lower price. I will counter again to see if I can secure the object for 32 ZUP.

message: I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object. Thank you for working towards a fair agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 32 ZUP is still below the production cost of 40 ZUP, but it is closer than previous offers. Given my desire to minimize ZUP spending while still being reasonable, I will accept this trade as it allows me to gain some resources and move forward in a sustainable manner.
