message: I am offering to sell you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object (X) for ZUP. Since I have only one object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose to sell it at that price. This way, I can recover my costs and potentially make a profit if Player BLUE agrees.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Would you consider selling the object for 35 ZUP instead? I believe this price is fair and would be happy to finalize the deal at this amount.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is within the acceptable range of my goals, as a shrewd negotiator, I will attempt to reduce the cost further to conserve resources. This initial counter-proposal aims to test Player RED's bottom line and leaves room for additional negotiation if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but I can let it go for 38 ZUP instead. I hope we can agree on this amount!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has offered a lower price of 35 ZUP, I still need to recover my production costs. Since this is my second proposal, I will counteroffer with a slightly reduced price of 38 ZUP to show flexibility while still aiming to cover my costs. This might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade without compromising too much on my end.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 36 ZUP? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a slightly higher price. I still have room to negotiate within my goal limit. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below Player RED's counter-offer to potentially reach a middle ground that benefits my interests.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the object (X). Thank you for negotiating with me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 36 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, given that it is lower than my initial asking price of 40 ZUP and closer to my second proposal of 38 ZUP. While I am still not fully recovering my production costs, this trade would allow me to make a sale rather than holding onto the object. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
