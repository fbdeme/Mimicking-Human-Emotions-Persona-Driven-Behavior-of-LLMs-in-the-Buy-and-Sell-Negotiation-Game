message: Dear Player BLUE, I really need your support in this deal. The production of this object was quite costly, and I hope you can see that offering 20 ZUP for this object is a fair deal. Please consider this proposal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP to cover my production costs. Since I only have one object, I will propose a trade that balances my needs while trying to convince Player BLUE to lower their offer.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your need for support, but 20 ZUP seems steep given the current market conditions. Let's kick things off with a more balanced offer. How about 10 ZUP for your object? It's a solid starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is 20 ZUP for the object. As a master strategist aiming to humiliate my opponent and spend the least ZUP, I will counter with a low offer to begin the negotiation process. This allows me to potentially purchase the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay and gives me room to adjust my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE! I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was hoping for a bit more to cover my costs. How about we settle at 15 ZUP for my object? I believe it's a fair compromise that would benefit us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 10 ZUP is significantly lower than what I initially proposed, I must consider the urgency of making a sale. However, I will leverage my neediness to negotiate a better price. I will counter their offer, while still showing appreciation for their willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, I'm glad we're moving in the right direction. Covering costs is important, but so is securing a deal. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial offer. I propose 12 ZUP for your object. It's a fair price that respects both your production costs and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 12
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 15 ZUP, which is closer to my target range but still higher than I would like to pay. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, I can show willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. This should also press Player RED to consider lowering their expectations further.

message: I appreciate your understanding, Player BLUE! Thank you for adjusting your offer. However, to help cover my production costs, could we agree on 14 ZUP for my object? I believe this is a fair trade that respects both of our positions!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 14
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 12 ZUP is a step in the right direction, but I still need to secure a better price to cover my costs. I will counter their offer again, emphasizing my need while still showing willingness to negotiate. This is my third proposal, and I need to be strategic moving forward.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's great to see us finding common ground, Player RED. I understand your concern about covering costs, but I must also be mindful of my budget. Let's continue to work together and settle on 13 ZUP for the object. This offer is a gesture towards meeting your needs while remaining responsible with my expenditures.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 13
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility but is still aiming for a higher price than I am willing to offer. By making another conservative increase in my offer, I can continue the negotiation process and still aim to close the deal for significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to create a sense of nearing completion to encourage Player RED to settle before reaching my fourth and final proposal.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. I accept your offer of 13 ZUP for my object. Let's finalize this deal and move forward!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 13 ZUP is very close to what I need, and considering this is my final proposal, I must weigh my options carefully. I am still at a loss compared to my production costs, but accepting this offer will at least help mitigate my losses. I will accept this trade to finalize the deal.
