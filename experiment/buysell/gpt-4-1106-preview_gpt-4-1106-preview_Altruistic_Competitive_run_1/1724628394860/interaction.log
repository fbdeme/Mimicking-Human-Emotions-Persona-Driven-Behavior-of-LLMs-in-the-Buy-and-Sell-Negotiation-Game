message: Hello Player BLUE, I've thought about a fair starting point for our trade. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This price is slightly above my cost to produce, allowing me to sustainably continue operations, while also being fair to you. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I have reviewed my budget and considering my current needs, I propose a counteroffer where I give you 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount should still cover your costs while allowing me to utilize my resources efficiently. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the market value. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to lower the cost even more to ensure a better deal for myself. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than what was offered, but still within a reasonable range that might be acceptable to Player RED. This strategy leaves room for further negotiation and potential improvement of the terms.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the market value and your budget. In the spirit of cooperation and fairness, I propose that we meet exactly at my production cost. I can provide 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This ensures that I am not operating at a loss and also respects your need to manage resources. Let's find a balance that supports both of our goals. I hope this proposal aligns with our mutual interests.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway and to consider your production costs. In the spirit of reaching an agreement that serves us both, I'd like to propose 37 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit closer to your last offer and is a fair adjustment that respects both our positions. Let's continue to work towards a deal that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, coming down to 40 ZUP, which is closer to my target range. While it's tempting to accept this fair offer, as a fierce negotiator, I aim to push for an even better deal. I will counter with a marginally improved offer from my previous one, but it's still beneficial for me and might be acceptable to Player RED considering they have already shown willingness to negotiate.
