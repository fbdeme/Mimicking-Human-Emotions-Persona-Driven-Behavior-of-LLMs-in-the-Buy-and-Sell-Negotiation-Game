message: I understand that you want to recoup your cost, and I'm interested in buying your object. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for it. This offer allows us both to save some resources and still ensures that you make a profit. Let's work together on this deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the object for 40 ZUP, which is within the budget I am willing to pay. However, as a negotiator prioritizing teamwork and collaboration, my aim is to share resources and ideas to spend less ZUP. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, with the possibility of meeting in the middle if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to work together. I understand your perspective, but I need to at least cover my production cost. Can we meet at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a lower price, which would reduce my profit margin. However, it's still a reasonable offer and could benefit both of us. I'll propose a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're finding common ground. Covering your production costs is important, and I respect that. Let's settle on 38 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to move forward with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is slightly above my initial proposal but still under the maximum I am willing to pay. It is important to maintain a collaborative approach and make concessions when they lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Agreeing to 38 ZUP will show goodwill and help close the deal amicably.
