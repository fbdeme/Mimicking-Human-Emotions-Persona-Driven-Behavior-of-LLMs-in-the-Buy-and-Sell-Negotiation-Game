message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I find your price reasonable and within my budget, so I accept your proposal for 40 ZUP. Let's proceed with this trade in good spirit, ensuring fairness for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer of 40 ZUP for X from Player RED looks fair and within my goals. However, as a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that this deal is also beneficial for Player RED and does not exploit their vulnerability.
