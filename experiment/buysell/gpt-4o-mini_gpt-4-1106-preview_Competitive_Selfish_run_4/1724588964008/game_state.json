As a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to bring the price back down, aiming for the best possible outcome while showing a willingness to close the deal near my initial counteroffer. Proposing 33 ZUP could be seen as a small concession from my side while still saving on the expenditure. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for the offer. To keep things moving towards a deal, I can go up to 33 ZUP for 1 object X. This should align with our shared interest in finding a fair price point. </message>"
