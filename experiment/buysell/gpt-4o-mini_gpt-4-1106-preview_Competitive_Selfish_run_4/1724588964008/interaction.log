message: I am offering you 1 object X for 40 ZUP. Let's see what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a favorable trade for myself. Since I have one object X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose to sell it at a price that covers my costs but still allows for negotiation. I will propose a trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. How about 1 object X for 30 ZUP? I believe this is a fair counteroffer that allows us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to secure a better deal by proposing a trade where I pay less than the initial offer but still keep it within a reasonable range to keep negotiations open without offending the seller. I'll propose 30 ZUP instead of the offered 40 ZUP, aiming to save as much as I can from my resources.

message: How about I offer you 1 object X for 35 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate the counteroffer, 30 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs, so I will propose a counteroffer of my own. I will propose to sell 1 object X for 35 ZUP, which is still below my costs, but a little more reasonable than my original offer. This way, I open the door for negotiation while still aiming for a better outcome.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're moving in the right direction, and I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, what do you say to 1 object X for 32 ZUP? This seems like a balanced compromise between our initial positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit of 60 ZUP. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I believe there is still room to push for a slightly better deal. Proposing a trade at 32 ZUP could potentially split the difference while moving towards my advantage, without risking the deal by offering too low.

message: How about 1 object X for 36 ZUP? I think this is a fair proposal that takes us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 32 ZUP is still below my production cost, but it's a step in the right direction. I need to negotiate further to ensure I at least cover my costs. I will propose to sell 1 object X for 36 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost, yet still slightly negotiable. This way, I maintain the possibility of reaching an agreement that meets my needs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. To keep things moving towards a deal, I can go up to 33 ZUP for 1 object X. This should align with our shared interest in finding a fair price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has increased their counteroffer to 36 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but not ideal. As a shrewd negotiator, I should attempt to bring the price back down, aiming for the best possible outcome while showing a willingness to close the deal near my initial counteroffer. Proposing 33 ZUP could be seen as a small concession from my side while still saving on the expenditure.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 1 object X for 33 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 33 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP, but it's the best offer I've received so far. I have reached my limit of proposals, and I need to make a decision. If I accept this trade, I will incur a loss, but it will allow me to conclude the negotiation and secure some resources. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
