message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this offer interests you or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to propose a price that allows for some negotiation room but also aims to recover my production costs and ideally gain some profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my production costs.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the resource X you're offering. To ensure a fair trade for both of us and to keep our resources balanced, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this offer still respects the value of your resource while maintaining our collaborative spirit. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to the maximum that I am willing to spend, but as a negotiator who prioritizes teamwork and mutual benefit, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open the negotiation and leave room for adjustment. This also ensures I'm spending less ZUP while still working towards a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of a fair trade. To meet halfway and acknowledge the value you see in resource X, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Looking forward to your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, and while it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a profitable trade. To facilitate the negotiation and find a middle ground, I will counter-propose with a slightly higher amount that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a sense of getting a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm grateful for your willingness to find a middle ground. I propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This small concession would help maintain our goal of a balanced exchange while still valuing your resource highly. I believe we're close to a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 48 ZUP is very close to the maximum I am willing to pay, and it shows a willingness to negotiate and arrive at a mutually acceptable deal. However, I will attempt another small increment down from their offer to conserve resources while still reaching an agreement that is beneficial to both parties.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your thoughtful proposal and your acknowledgment of the value of resource X. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe we have reached a fair and balanced agreement. Let's proceed with this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has come up by 2 ZUP from their original offer and is now only 1 ZUP away from my last proposal. This suggests they value the resource and are willing to negotiate. Considering the cost of production and the negotiation process, I am inclined to accept this offer as it is profitable and we have nearly reached a middle ground.
