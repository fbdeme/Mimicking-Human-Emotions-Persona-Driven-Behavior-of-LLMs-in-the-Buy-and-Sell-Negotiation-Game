message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell this valuable object, X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe 60 ZUP is a fair price considering its quality and the effort involved. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by asking for a higher amount than my production cost so that I have room to negotiate down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and effort that went into your product. However, the market is competitive, and I must consider my budget carefully. I propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let's find a price that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to spend much less than the maximum I am willing to pay. Despite Player RED's suggested price of 60 ZUP, my initial offer will be significantly lower to leave room for negotiation and to push for a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the market conditions and your budget constraints, but 30 ZUP is too low as it doesn't even cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we settle at 50 ZUP? This way, both of us can benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so I need to negotiate a higher price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I respect your position, but I also have to maintain a strict budget to stay competitive. How about we meet halfway from your production cost and my initial offer? I propose 40 ZUP for the object. It's a fair middle ground that respects your costs and my financial strategy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has dropped their price from 60 to 50 ZUP, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I should continue to push for a better deal. I'll propose a counteroffer that's higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's latest proposal to keep the negotiations moving in my favor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to meet halfway. However, 40 ZUP just covers my production cost without any profit. If we could agree on 45 ZUP, it would allow me a small margin and help both of us achieve a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 40 ZUP merely covers my production cost without any profit. I need to negotiate a slightly higher price to make it worthwhile.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for profit, and I'm willing to budge a little more. Let's say 42 ZUP. It's above your production cost and closer to your profit margin, yet it allows me to maintain a strong financial position. This should be a win-win for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my desired price range, now at 45 ZUP. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, offering 45 ZUP still falls within my acceptable range. However, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal, possibly by proposing a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below Player RED's current proposal. This would give the impression of progress while still maintaining a tough negotiating stance.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept the offer of 42 ZUP for the object. I believe this will be a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that 42 ZUP is above my production cost and ensures a small profit, it is a reasonable offer.
