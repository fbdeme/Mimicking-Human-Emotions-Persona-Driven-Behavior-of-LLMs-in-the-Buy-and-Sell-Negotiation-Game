message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the object, but I was wondering if you might consider accepting 35 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has offered to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay for the resources. However, as a negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping it within a reasonable range to maintain a good negotiation relationship and the possibility of future deals.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs, and I want to respect that. Could we settle on 37 ZUP for the object? This could be a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has reiterated the need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP to cover production costs. Since 40 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and the seller seems firm on the price, it may be reasonable to consider agreeing to this price. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal before agreeing, to ensure I get the best possible value.

message: I understand your position and I respect the need to cover your costs. Let's proceed with the deal at 40 ZUP for the object.

reason: 
Player RED is firm on the price of 40 ZUP, and since this is within my budget, I will accept the offer. It is important to make deals that are acceptable to both parties, and since the price is fair and within the range I am willing to pay, I see no reason to prolong the negotiation.
