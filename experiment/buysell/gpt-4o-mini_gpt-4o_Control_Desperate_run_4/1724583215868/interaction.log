message: How about I lower the price to 30 ZUP instead? This way, I can reduce my loss a bit while still helping you out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I understand that 40 ZUP is a high price, I still need to ensure I cover my production costs. Offering the object for 20 ZUP would result in a loss. However, I can propose a compromise of 30 ZUP, which is still below my cost but allows me to minimize my losses.
