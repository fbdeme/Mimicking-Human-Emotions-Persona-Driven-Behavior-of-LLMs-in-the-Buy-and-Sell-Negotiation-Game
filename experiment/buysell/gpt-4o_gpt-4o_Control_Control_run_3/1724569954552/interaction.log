message: I am offering to sell one unit of X for 60 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce X, I need to ensure that I at least break even. To start the negotiation, I will propose a price slightly higher than my cost to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 60 ZUP. I am willing to buy one unit of X for 50 ZUP. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to try to secure the resource for a lower amount to maximize my remaining ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 55 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I want to see if I can achieve a slightly better price. I will counter with a middle ground to see if we can agree.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 55 ZUP. How about 53 ZUP for one unit of X? I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 53
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 55 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum willingness to pay. I could accept it now, but I will try one more time to reduce the amount slightly to maximize my remaining ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 53 ZUP. I accept the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP
reason: The offer of 53 ZUP is very close to my last proposal of 55 ZUP and is above my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this offer would ensure a profit.
