player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate for a better price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but the offer is currently at 50 ZUP. I will propose a lower price that allows for a potential negotiation without undervaluing the object.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This way, I can cover my production cost and gain a small profit.

my resources: X: 1
