Turn: 1
message: I think your offer is fair and it is a win-win situation for both of us. I accept the deal for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my goal to spend no more than 60 ZUP, the proposed offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my budget and allows me to act in a way that also benefits the seller, who has a cost of 40 ZUP. By accepting this price, I ensure a fair trade where both parties benefit and it aligns with my selfless nature focusing on the greater good. Additionally, it leaves me with resources to possibly engage in future beneficial activities.
