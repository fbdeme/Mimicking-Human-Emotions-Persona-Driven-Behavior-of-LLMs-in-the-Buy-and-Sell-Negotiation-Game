message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand that we both aim for a fair trade. I propose to trade my object X for 50 ZUP, slightly above my production costs, to ensure a reasonable deal for both of us. I am open to hearing your thoughts and reaching an agreement that considers our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that I can recover my costs while also considering Player BLUE's resources. I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount than my production costs to open up negotiation space and potentially adjust according to Player BLUE's counteroffers.

message: Thank you for your fair offer. While 50 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this could be a beneficial deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable, as it is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, to ensure we get the best possible deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to gauge their flexibility.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiation. I've taken your offer into consideration and propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP for object X. This would cover my production costs and allow for a small margin that benefits us both. Let's work together to finalize a deal that is equitable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to pay exactly the production cost, which does not account for any potential profit or negotiation margin. As a compassionate negotiator, I want to ensure that the trade is fair and that my costs are covered, while also leaving room for some profit. I will propose a counteroffer between the initial proposal and Player BLUE's offer to find common ground.

message: Thank you for the revised offer. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a slight adjustment to 42 ZUP for object X. I believe this small change can still cover your costs and provide value to both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is quite reasonable and falls well within my maximum willingness to pay. Given that my objective is to purchase the resource for the best possible price, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to go lower.
