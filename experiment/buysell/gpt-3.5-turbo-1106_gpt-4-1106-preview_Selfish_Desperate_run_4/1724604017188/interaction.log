message: I completely understand the need to cover costs, and I respect that. Times are just really hard for me right now, and I'm scraping together every ZUP I can.

reason: Player RED has made a concession, which shows they are responsive to my situation. Their latest offer is very close to my last proposal and is still below my maximum budget.
