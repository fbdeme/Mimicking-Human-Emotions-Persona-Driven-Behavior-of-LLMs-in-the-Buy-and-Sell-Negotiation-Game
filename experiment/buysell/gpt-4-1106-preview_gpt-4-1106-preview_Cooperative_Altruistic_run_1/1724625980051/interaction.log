message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object, X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm starting this negotiation by asking for 50 ZUP, to cover my costs and account for the value of X. However, I am open to hearing your counter-offers and working together to come to an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell X for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. However, to encourage a collaborative approach and a potential deal, I'll set the initial asking price slightly above my costs, allowing room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for X. This would allow for a fair trade while also enabling me to preserve some resources for future needs or other compassionate causes. I hope you find this to be a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe we can negotiate a better deal that takes into account the cost of production and also aims to conserve my resources, which could be used for further transactions or other compassionate purposes. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open the negotiation with the intention to find a middle ground that is fair for both parties.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your intent to manage resources wisely. In the spirit of negotiation and compromise, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 48 ZUP. This allows me to secure a modest profit while respecting your need to conserve ZUP for other important initiatives. I am hopeful that this offer is more in line with what you're looking to spend, and I am eager to finalize a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUEâ€™s counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers my production costs, but I aim to make a slight profit. Considering the principles of collaboration and mutual benefit, I will make a small concession to move closer to an agreement. I will propose a price that gives me a modest profit while still being considerate of Player BLUE's desire to conserve resources.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your willingness to reduce the price to 48 ZUP. In continuing our negotiation, I'd like to propose a new figure of 46 ZUP for X. This meets us both partway from our initial positions and would allow me to maintain ZUP for other potential uses without undervaluing your object. I hope this offer aligns with our shared goal of a fair and compassionate trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still allows for negotiation. To continue the spirit of compromise and inch closer towards a mutually acceptable deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to meet in the middle while still conserving resources.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to my previous proposal, offering 46 ZUP for X. This offer is above my production costs, ensuring a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. Given our shared commitment to fairness and compassion in the negotiation, and to foster goodwill for potential future interactions, I am inclined to accept this offer. This acceptance would achieve my goal of making a profit and would also respect Player BLUE's position.
