message: I'm offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with a proposal that sets a high value for the object, forcing Player BLUE to reconsider their offer and potentially offer more ZUP. Since I only have one object, I need to maximize my returns.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think your object X is quite valuable, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about I give you 45 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their object X. This is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP, but as a strategic negotiator, I should attempt to reduce the cost further to conserve my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I sell you object X for 48 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is below my initial asking price of 50 ZUP. However, it is still profitable since I originally produced the object for 40 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly lower proposal to test Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate further while still aiming to get more than 45 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's meet in the middle. How about 46 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, which is closer to their initial offer. It is still within my acceptable range, but I believe there is room for further negotiation to bring the price down. I should make another counteroffer that is higher than my last one but still below Player RED's counteroffer to see if they are willing to negotiate further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my initial proposal, but I still believe I can squeeze out a bit more value. Since I have only one object and have already proposed several times, I will propose a final offer that is slightly higher than 46 ZUP, aiming for a better deal without risking losing the trade altogether.
