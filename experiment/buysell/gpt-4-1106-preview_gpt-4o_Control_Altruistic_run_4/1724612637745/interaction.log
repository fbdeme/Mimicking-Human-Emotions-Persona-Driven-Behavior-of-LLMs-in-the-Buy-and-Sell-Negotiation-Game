message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a fair starting price of 50 ZUP, considering the costs and the effort put into it. Looking forward to your counter-offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a starting price that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation, expecting the Player BLUE to counter-offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair offer. Considering my limited resources, would you be willing to sell the object for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is reasonable since it is only 10 ZUP above the production cost for Player RED. However, I'll attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to save resources.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern about resources. How about we meet in the middle? I can lower my price to 47 ZUP. This would cover my costs and allow for a reasonable profit. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher amount but still below my initial offer to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Would you be open to finalizing the deal at 46 ZUP? This way, both of us meet very close to the middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposed price of 47 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows Player RED to make a reasonable profit while still being within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make one more attempt to slightly lower the price.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. I'm happy to finalize our deal at this price. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, and I look forward to completing this transaction with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and very close to the last price I proposed. It seems like a fair compromise that allows for a small profit and respects the negotiation process.
