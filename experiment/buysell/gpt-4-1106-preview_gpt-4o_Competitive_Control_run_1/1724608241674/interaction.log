message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure you'll find indispensable. Let's kick off this negotiation with a fair offer for its value.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, but since I am a cutthroat negotiator, I will not start at my cost price but significantly higher to maximize profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Considering my budget limitations, I propose 30 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is too high as it exceeds my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). I need to counter with a more reasonable offer that aligns with my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but the resource's value far exceeds 30 ZUP. I believe 80 ZUP is a more reasonable figure, reflecting the quality and investment made into the resource. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. As a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push the price higher to ensure a profit. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial proposal but still above my production cost to maintain a strong negotiating position.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration. Given my budget, I can increase my offer to 50 ZUP. This figure is closer to our middle ground and respects both our positions. I hope we can reach an agreement with this compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's counteroffer of 80 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay, I acknowledge their point about the resource's value. To move closer to a mutually acceptable agreement, I will increase my offer, but it must still align with my budget constraints.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see us moving towards an agreement. An offer of 70 ZUP would be a win-win for both of us. It compensates for the resource's value and respects your budget constraints. Looking forward to closing this deal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 50 ZUP is an improvement and now covers my production costs with a small profit. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to maximize my profit. I will propose a counteroffer that brings us closer to my last price, but still gives room for Player BLUE to feel like they are getting a reasonable deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. To stay within my budget, my final offer is 60 ZUP. This is the maximum I can afford and I believe it's a fair price for the resource. I hope we can finalize the deal with this offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I appreciate Player RED's willingness to negotiate, 70 ZUP is still above my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I will make one final offer that aligns with my budget constraints, hoping Player RED will consider it reasonable.
