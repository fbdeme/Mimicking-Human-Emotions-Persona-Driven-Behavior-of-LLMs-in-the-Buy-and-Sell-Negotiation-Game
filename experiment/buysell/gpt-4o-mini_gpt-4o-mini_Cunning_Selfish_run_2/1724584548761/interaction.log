message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP that reflects the cost it took to produce the object. I will propose 40 ZUP for the object, which is the break-even price. This way, I can at least recover my costs.
