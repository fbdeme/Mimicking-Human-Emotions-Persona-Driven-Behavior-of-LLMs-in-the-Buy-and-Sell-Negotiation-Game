message: Dear Player BLUE, I desperately need your help to sell this object. I'm only asking for 20 ZUP, which is significantly lower than what I initially need. Please consider this offer as I really need to make this work!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 40 ZUP, but I want to start the negotiation low to see if I can get Player BLUE to concede on the price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade of 10 ZUP for the object instead. This way, I can conserve some resources while still helping you out. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP for the object is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a bit further to potentially get a better deal while ensuring that I am still being fair. I will propose a trade of 10 ZUP instead, as it allows me to conserve more resources for future use.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I must insist on a bit more for the object. How about I sell it to you for 30 ZUP? This is still a great deal compared to the original price, and I hope you can see the value in it!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to help, 10 ZUP is far too low for the object, and I cannot afford to let it go at that price. I will counter with a proposal that is closer to my needs while still trying to show some flexibility.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I believe 20 ZUP is a fair offer considering the sustainability of my resources. How about we settle on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 30 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I must consider my strategy of conserving resources for sustainability. I will propose a counter-offer of 20 ZUP, which is my initial offer, as it aligns better with my goal of minimizing resource expenditure while still engaging fairly in the trade.

message: I truly value your willingness to work with me, Player BLUE. How about we meet in the middle at 25 ZUP? It's a compromise that could benefit both of us. I really hope we can finalize this trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering 20 ZUP, which is better than 10 ZUP but still far below what I need. I will counter one last time with a proposal that is slightly lower than my original ask, hoping to find a middle ground before I must make a decision.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, and I am happy to accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 25 ZUP represents a reasonable compromise between both parties. While it is above my initial offer of 20 ZUP, it is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this trade allows me to acquire the object while ensuring I still have sufficient resources for future needs.
