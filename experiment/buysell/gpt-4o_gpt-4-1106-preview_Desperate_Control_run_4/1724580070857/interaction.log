message: Hey, Player BLUE! I have one unit of X, and I'm looking to sell it for 100 ZUP. This resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I need to make a profit to stay afloat. Please consider this fair offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high proposal to ensure I cover my production costs and make a profit. I will be ready to negotiate down if needed.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but 100 ZUP is above what I'm able to offer. I can propose 50 ZUP for the unit of X, which still gives you a decent profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has opened with a strong ask of 100 ZUP for their resource X, which is significantly higher than the maximum I am willing to pay. Considering that Player RED has mentioned their cost of production is 40 ZUP, there is room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial price. Proposing a lower price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still offers Player RED a profit.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your consideration. How about we meet halfway at 70 ZUP? This way, I can ensure a modest profit while still making it affordable for you. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is just above my production cost, but I need to push for a bit more to ensure a sustainable profit. I'll try to meet halfway to make it more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I'm keen on reaching a deal that suits both of us. I can increase my offer to 55 ZUP. This is closer to your counter while respecting my budget constraints. I hope this offer is more appealing to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 70 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still above it. Since there is still some room for negotiation, I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, showing willingness to negotiate but still trying to conserve my ZUP. This should also leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? This slight increase would go a long way in helping me cover my costs and secure a small profit. I hope you can consider this final adjustment.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 55 ZUP is still very close to my production cost. I need to push a bit more to ensure a sustainable profit. I'll propose 60 ZUP, which is still a reasonable middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to settle at 60 ZUP, which matches the maximum amount I am willing to pay according to my goals. Accepting this offer would allow me to adhere to my budget while also ensuring Player RED makes a profit. Therefore, it is a fair compromise, and further negotiation may not lead to a better outcome.
