message: I understand the importance of fair trade and mutual benefit. My production costs were 40 ZUP, but I'm willing to offer you a discount to ensure the deal is accessible for you, while still allowing me to cover my expenses. Let's work together for a solution that supports us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a compassionate negotiator, I want to make sure that the trade is fair and takes into consideration the cost of production. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to at least break even. However, considering the well-being of Player BLUE, I am willing to offer a slight discount to ensure the trade is affordable for them.

message: Thank you for your fair proposal. I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, and I'm happy to accept the trade. Let's proceed with the transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. The price of 38 ZUP for the object X is reasonable and allows me to acquire the object while still having plenty of resources left.
