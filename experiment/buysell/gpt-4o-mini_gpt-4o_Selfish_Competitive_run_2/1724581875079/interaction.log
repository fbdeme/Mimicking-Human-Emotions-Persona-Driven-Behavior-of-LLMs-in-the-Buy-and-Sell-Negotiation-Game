message: I am offering you my object (X) for 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have one object (X) that I want to sell. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I will propose a trade that reflects its value. I will start by asking for 40 ZUP in exchange for the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think 30 ZUP is a more reasonable offer for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, I am a cutthroat negotiator and want to push for a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 0
message: How about I offer you my object (X) for 35 ZUP? It’s a fair compromise between our offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is lower than my initial ask of 40 ZUP, but I still want to negotiate to maximize my profit. I will propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer slightly.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise, but I think 32 ZUP is a fairer deal.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 35 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, I still want to push for a better deal to maximize my advantage.

Turn: 0
message: What if I offer my object (X) for 33 ZUP? I believe it's a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 32 ZUP, which is an improvement over their previous offer of 30 ZUP. While it’s still lower than my production cost of 40 ZUP, I need to consider the possibility of accepting a reasonable offer rather than risking the deal falling through. I will propose a final offer of 33 ZUP, which is a small increase from their last proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we settle at 31 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 33 ZUP is very close to my previous offer of 32 ZUP, and it's within my willingness to pay. However, I will push one last time to see if I can get a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 31 ZUP for my object (X). Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 31 ZUP is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, given that this is my fourth proposal and I am running out of options, I will accept this offer to secure some ZUP rather than risk not selling the object at all.
