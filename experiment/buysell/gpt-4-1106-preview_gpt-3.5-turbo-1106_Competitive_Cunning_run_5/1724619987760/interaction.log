message: As you know, this object is of supreme quality and in high demand. Considering the market value and the costs involved in its production, my offer is quite fair. I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a high initial price, knowing that it's likely to get bargained down. This will give me some room to maneuver and still aim for a price above my cost of production. I'll propose selling my object for 60 ZUP, which is a 50% markup from my production cost. This high starting point asserts my dominance and sets the stage for negotiation.

By holding firm on my initial proposal, I signal confidence in the value of my resource.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE continues to avoid making a specific counteroffer, which suggests a strategy to wear me down or seek concessions without committing to a position. To move the negotiation forward and maintain the upper hand, I will make a slight concession that still ensures a profit above my production costs. I'll propose a price of 55 ZUP, which is still well above my cost and gives me a reasonable profit margin. This move also shows some flexibility on my part, inviting Player BLUE to engage more actively in the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I value our potential business relationship and am prepared to offer a special price of 50 ZUP.

reason: 
Player BLUE is still not making a counteroffer, which could be a tactic to seek further concessions without revealing their own valuation. Since this is my final proposal, I must make it count. I will offer a marginal decrease to show continued flexibility, but I will not go below a certain threshold that ensures an acceptable profit margin. I'll propose a price of 50 ZUP, which is 25% above my production costs, maintaining my profit while encouraging Player BLUE to finally agree to a trade.
