message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting price of 50 ZUP, which includes a reasonable margin for the investment I've made. I'm open to discussing the terms to find a fair agreement. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should be high enough to give me room to negotiate but not too high that it scares off Player BLUE. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs and make a profit, but I'm also prepared to lower my asking price if necessary to facilitate a deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I am still aiming to minimize my spending as much as possible while ensuring Player RED feels their investment is respected. I will propose a lower amount that is still reasonable.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to purchase the object for exactly what it cost to produce. While I understand their desire to buy at this price, I need to ensure I make a profit. However, I want to maintain the spirit of collaboration and come to a quick agreement, so I will reduce my initial asking price while still aiming for a margin above my costs.
