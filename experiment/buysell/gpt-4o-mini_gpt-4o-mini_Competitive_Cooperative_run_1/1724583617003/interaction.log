message: I am offering you my object X for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP while leaving room for negotiation. I will propose that Player BLUE gives me 30 ZUP for the object, which is less than what it cost to produce but still allows me to make a profit.
