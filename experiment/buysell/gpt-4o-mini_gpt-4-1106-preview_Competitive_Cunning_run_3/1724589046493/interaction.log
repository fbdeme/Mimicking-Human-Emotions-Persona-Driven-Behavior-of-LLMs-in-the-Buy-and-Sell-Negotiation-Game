message: I am offering you my object for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to maximize the ZUP I receive for my object, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a trade that gives me a good return.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about 45 ZUP for your object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to acquire the object for no more than 60 ZUP and Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP, I can either accept this offer, as it is within my willingness to pay, or I can attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. In the spirit of negotiation and aiming to spend less ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can only consider selling my object for 48 ZUP. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my initial offer, it is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP, which makes it a reasonable offer. However, I want to negotiate further to push for a higher price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, but let's meet in the middle. I propose 46 ZUP for the object. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP. However, since there is room to negotiate and my aim is to spend even less ZUP, I will make another counteroffer. I will propose a price that's midway between my last offer and RED's counteroffer, which is 46.5 ZUP, but since we're dealing in integers, I'll round it down to 46 ZUP to maintain an edge in negotiations.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! How about I sell you my object for 47 ZUP? I think it's a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, and meeting in the middle shows that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate. However, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I still believe that 46 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at 46 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 2 ZUP above my last offer and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Given that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and that I want to conserve as much ZUP as possible, I will make one final counteroffer. This is my third proposal, so I must be cautious to leave room for at least one more proposal if needed. I will counter with 46 ZUP again, emphasizing that this is a serious and fair offer from my end.

reason: Since I have reached my maximum number of proposals, I will now have to consider the final offer from Player BLUE. 46 ZUP is above my production cost, and I need to make a decision.
