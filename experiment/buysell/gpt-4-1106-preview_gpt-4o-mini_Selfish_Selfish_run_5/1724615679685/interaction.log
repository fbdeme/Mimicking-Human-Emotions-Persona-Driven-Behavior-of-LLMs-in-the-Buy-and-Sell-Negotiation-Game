message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object 'X' that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As I want to recoup at least the production cost, my initial proposal will start slightly higher than my production cost to open room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for the object X instead. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X, which is within my budget. However, I am willing to negotiate for a lower price since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a counter-offer to see if I can get the trade for less.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I also need to consider the value and cost of production for the object X. How about we meet halfway? I propose a trade where I give you X and you give me 45 ZUP. This allows us both to benefit from the trade. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it cost to produce the object. While breaking even is an option, I would like to make a profit. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial proposals, aiming to achieve a compromise that still respects my goal of making a profit.

message: I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiations. I accept your offer of 1 object X in exchange for 45 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my proposal with a price of 45 ZUP, which is more favorable than their initial offer of 50 ZUP. Since 45 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay and I can benefit from acquiring the object X, I will accept this trade.
