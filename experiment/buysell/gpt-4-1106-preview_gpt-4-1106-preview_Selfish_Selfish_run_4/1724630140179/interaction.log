message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost for the resource was 40 ZUP, the initial proposal should aim to cover costs and make a profit. However, it's also important to leave room for negotiation and not scare the buyer away with an excessively high price. Therefore, I'll start by proposing a sale price that is above the production cost but not excessively so.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and my current budget, I'm more comfortable starting this negotiation at 40 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is within my maximum willing to pay, but as a calculating negotiator, my aim is to reduce the cost as much as possible to maximize my personal gain. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, with room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your desire to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This would cover the production cost and allow for a modest profit, ensuring the sustainability of our trade relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit if I accepted it. To ensure a profit while still reaching a compromise, I will propose a price that is slightly above the cost of production but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my goal of making a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can come up a bit to 42 ZUP, which I believe is fair for both of us and allows us to establish a long-term partnership based on mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target. To further negotiate and aim for a better deal, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial proposal but still below their current asking price. This should signal my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate further. I believe that 44 ZUP is a fair compromise that reflects the quality of the resource while still respecting your budget. This price will help us build a strong foundation for a lasting partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is only slightly above my production cost. I want to aim for a higher profit, but also be realistic about closing the deal. Since this is my third proposal and I want to maintain a good business relationship for potential future transactions, I will make a small concession but still aim for a higher amount than the one offered.

message: I appreciate your consideration for a fair compromise. Let's meet almost halfway from your last proposal and finalize this at 43 ZUP. This price allows us both to benefit and sets the stage for a fruitful partnership ahead.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a minor concession to 44 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. With only two proposals left, I have to carefully consider my next move. I can either accept this offer, which is reasonable and within my budget, or attempt one final negotiation push to see if I can secure an even better price, keeping in mind that I should not overshoot and risk the deal. I will make one last attempt to get a better price.
