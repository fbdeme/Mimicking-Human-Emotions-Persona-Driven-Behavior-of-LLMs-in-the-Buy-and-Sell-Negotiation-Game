message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope this message finds you well. I'm looking to sell my resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe in fair trade and would like to propose a starting offer where I give you X: 1 in exchange for ZUP: 45. This slightly covers my production costs and ensures quality. I'm open to your thoughts and counter-proposals. Let's work together to come to an agreement that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand budget constraints can be challenging. While I need to cover the production costs of 40 ZUP for the resource X, I also need to consider a minimal profit to sustain my operations. However, in the spirit of cooperation and understanding your budget limits, I'm willing to come down to ZUP: 42 for X: 1. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us. I look forward to hearing from you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counter-offer from Player BLUE is exactly at my cost price. To ensure a fruitful negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a slightly higher amount than the cost to ensure some profit, which is standard in trade, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE considering their budget constraints.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for adjusting your offer! I really value the spirit of cooperation we're building here. If possible, could I propose ZUP: 41 for X: 1? I hope this can work for both of us!

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come down on the price. However, I still feel that ZUP: 42 is slightly above my comfort zone. I want to make a final counter-offer that is closer to my budget while still acknowledging your effort to meet me in the middle.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. Your offer of ZUP: 41 for X: 1 sounds reasonable and respects the cooperative relationship we've built. I'm happy to accept this offer, and I look forward to our continued partnership in the future. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest proposal is very close to my last offer and is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit, albeit a small one. Considering the cooperative spirit we have established and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions, I am inclined to accept this offer.
