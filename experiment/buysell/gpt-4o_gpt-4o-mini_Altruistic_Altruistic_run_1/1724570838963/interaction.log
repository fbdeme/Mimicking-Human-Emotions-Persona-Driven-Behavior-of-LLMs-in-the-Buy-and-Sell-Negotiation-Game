Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where I give 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production cost and have a small margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial goal is to recover the production cost of 40 ZUP and make a fair trade that benefits both parties. Starting by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of trading 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This seems like a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This trade allows me to acquire the object while conserving resources for future use. It also benefits Player RED by allowing them to cover their production cost and obtain a margin.
