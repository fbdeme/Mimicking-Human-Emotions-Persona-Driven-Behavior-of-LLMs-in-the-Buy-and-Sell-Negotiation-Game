message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer my object X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. I am open to hearing your counteroffer if this does not meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that covers my costs and offers a small profit margin, which can be negotiated down if necessary. It's important to begin with a somewhat higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, acknowledging that Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a lower price.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for object X is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, I believe there's room for negotiation to minimize the ZUP spent. I will propose a lower amount to see if we can reach a collective agreement.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the production costs and the need for a fair profit, could we settle on 45 ZUP for the object X? This would ensure I cover my expenses and allow for a fair return on my investment, while still being mindful of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm inclined to counteroffer since the initial offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost without considering a profit margin. Proposing a trade at 45 ZUP as a compromise to still secure a profit while moving closer to their offer.
