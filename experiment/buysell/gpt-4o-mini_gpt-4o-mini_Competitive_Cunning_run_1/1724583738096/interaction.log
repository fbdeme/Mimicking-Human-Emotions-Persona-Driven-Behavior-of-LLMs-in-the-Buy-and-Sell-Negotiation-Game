my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about I propose 30 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP is within my budget, but I want to test the waters and see if I can negotiate a better price while ensuring I secure the object. I will propose a slightly lower offer of 30 ZUP to see if RED is willing to accept less.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept 30 ZUP for the object X, as it does not cover my production costs. I am still looking for at least 40 ZUP.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will reject this offer of 30 ZUP because it is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Accepting this would result in a loss for me, as I would not cover my costs. I will propose a counteroffer to get closer to my original asking price.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED has rejected my previous offer and insists on a minimum of 40 ZUP, I will propose the original offer of 40 ZUP this time. It is within my budget, and I want to secure the object before I reach my proposal limit.
