message: Hello Player BLUE, I am proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade that covers my production cost and adds a reasonable margin of profit. Given that it cost 40 ZUP to produce the object, I will start by proposing 60 ZUP to cover costs and ensure a small profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your consideration. I would like to propose 55 ZUP for the object. This amount still provides a fair profit for me while being more reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP still provides a profit, but I believe we can aim for a slightly higher amount that better reflects the value of the object while remaining fair to both parties. I will propose a middle ground.
