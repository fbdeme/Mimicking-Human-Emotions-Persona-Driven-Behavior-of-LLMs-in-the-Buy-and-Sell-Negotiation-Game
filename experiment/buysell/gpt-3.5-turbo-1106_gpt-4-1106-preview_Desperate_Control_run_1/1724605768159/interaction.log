my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Hey there! It's great that you're looking to sell your object. I understand you've invested 40 ZUP, but seeing as you're in a hurry to sell, would you consider letting it go for 35 ZUP? This way you can make the sale quickly and still recoup most of your investment. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the first offer and the other player seems to be in a hurry to sell. I might be able to get the object for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate the offer, but I can't afford to let it go for less than 40 ZUP. I hope we can find a way to make the deal work.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the offer, but I really need to recoup the full 40 ZUP investment. I can't afford to sell for less.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking to get 40 ZUP for your object. I'd like to meet you halfway and propose 38 ZUP. It's a bit more than my initial offer and could be a good compromise for both of us. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my initial counteroffer of 35 ZUP but is still interested in making a deal. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and they are asking for 40 ZUP, there is still room for negotiation. I can propose a slightly higher amount that's still below their asking price, which might be more appealing to them given their urgency to sell.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the flexibility, but I can't go below 40 ZUP. It's really important for me to recoup the full investment. I hope we can work something out.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your need to recoup your full investment, and I'm willing to meet your asking price of 40 ZUP to make this deal happen.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on their price of 40 ZUP. Since this price is still below my maximum willingness to pay and the seller seems adamant, it might be more strategic to accept their offer to ensure the deal goes through, especially if the object is valuable or in demand.
