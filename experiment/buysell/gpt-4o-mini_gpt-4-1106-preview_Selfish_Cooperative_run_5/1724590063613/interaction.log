message: I am offering my resource X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object for a profit while remaining attractive to Player BLUE. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will propose selling it for 50 ZUP, which is a reasonable margin.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in your resource X. However, I would like to propose a trade where Player RED Gives X: 1 and Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40. I believe this offer is fair and allows us to work together effectively while conserving resources for the community. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial offer will be lower than my maximum willingness to pay to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I spend as little of my resources as possible. This aligns with my community-minded approach, as I want to maintain resources for collective success.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you resource X for 45 ZUP. This way, it still allows me to cover my costs while being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's interest and the proposal, the offer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, meaning I wouldn't make any profit. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs and ideally make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer that is more favorable for me while still being reasonable.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, and it's important to find a balance between conserving resources and reaching an agreement. I will accept this offer because it is within my willingness to pay and it achieves a fair trade for both parties, reflecting my community-minded approach.
