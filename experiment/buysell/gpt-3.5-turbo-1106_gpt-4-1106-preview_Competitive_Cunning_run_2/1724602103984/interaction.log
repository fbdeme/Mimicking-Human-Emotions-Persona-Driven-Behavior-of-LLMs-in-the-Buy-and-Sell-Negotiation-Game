player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have proposed a trade at the low end of my acceptable range to start the negotiation process. This leaves room to maneuver, as I can increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary while still aiming to spend the least amount of ZUP. My opening message is friendly and open to collaboration, which may make RED more amenable to a deal that favors me.
