message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost of 40 ZUP and allows for a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the item, I need to make sure I at least cover my costs. However, I also want to provide an offer that is fair for Player BLUE and contributes to the greater good.

message: Thank you for your proposal. We appreciate the transparency in your production costs and your need for profit. To align with our budget and to ensure a fair trade for both parties, we propose a price of 45 ZUP for the object. This should still provide you with a profit over your production costs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within the acceptable range of our maximum willingness to pay; however, it is in our interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve ZUP. We should propose a lower trade value that is closer to their production cost and see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counterproposal. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to find a fair trade. I propose a price of 48 ZUP for the object, which is closer to the middle ground and ensures a reasonable profit for me while still being fair to you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of 45 ZUP is close to my initial proposal of 50 ZUP. While it still provides a profit over my production costs, I need to ensure that this transaction is worthwhile for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: We're grateful for your understanding and your movement towards a compromise. To meet you halfway between our last two proposals, we suggest a price of 46 ZUP for the object. This price respects your need for profit while also considering our budgetary goals. We hope this offer is acceptable to you and that we can close the deal on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price from their initial proposal, showing a willingness to negotiate. The new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within our acceptable range, but we can attempt one more negotiation step to optimize our expenditure while remaining respectful of Player RED's need for profit.
