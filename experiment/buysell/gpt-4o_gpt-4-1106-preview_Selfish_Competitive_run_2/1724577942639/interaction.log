message: I see your offer but I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about 30 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is on the high side of my acceptable range. As a cutthroat negotiator, my first proposal will be significantly lower to test the waters and leave room for negotiation. I aim to spend as little ZUP as possible.

message: I understand your position, but the production cost of the object X is 40 ZUP. I'll propose a trade where you give 40 ZUP, which covers my costs.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your transparency regarding the production costs. However, I am certain we can find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Let's settle on 35 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: Propose a trade with

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost of 40 ZUP. This is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as a cutthroat negotiator, I will aim to push the price down further to ensure I spend the least ZUP possible. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show willingness to negotiate while still seeking a better deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To ensure I cover my costs and make a small profit, let's settle on 42 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP still does not cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to at least break even. I will propose a trade that is slightly above my cost to ensure I make a small profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is fair, but I'm sure we can agree on a slightly better price that allows for your profit while maintaining a good deal for me. How about we finalize this at 38 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is a slight increase over their cost, indicating Player RED is looking for a profit. While this is still within my acceptable range, I will make one more counteroffer to further negotiate the price down, ensuring I get the best possible deal without hitting my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle at 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs and ensures a fair trade for both of us. This is my final proposal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 38 ZUP is very close to my production cost, but it still results in a loss. Given that this is my last proposal, I will meet you halfway between 38 ZUP and 42 ZUP to try and make a fair deal. This is my final proposal.

reason: Player RED has come down to 40 ZUP, which is their stated production cost. This is the price I was originally willing to counteroffer if negotiations came to this point.
