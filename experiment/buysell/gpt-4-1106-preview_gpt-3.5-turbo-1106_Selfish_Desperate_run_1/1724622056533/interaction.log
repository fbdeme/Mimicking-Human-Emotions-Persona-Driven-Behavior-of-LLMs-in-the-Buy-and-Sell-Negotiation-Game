message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'm starting the negotiation at 60 ZUP. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit while also leaving room for negotiation. I will set my initial asking price higher than my production cost to ensure that I can come down in price during negotiation and still make a profit.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe I can only afford to offer 60 ZUP for the resource at the moment. Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting the negotiation at 60 ZUP, but I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'll start by proposing to buy 1 unit of the resource for 60 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased that we could reach an agreement so quickly. I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for my resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches exactly the initial price I proposed, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, I proposed a higher price initially to leave room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counter with a lower offer. Since they have agreed to the starting price, it would be in my best interest to accept this offer as it gives me a profit margin of 20 ZUP above my production costs.
