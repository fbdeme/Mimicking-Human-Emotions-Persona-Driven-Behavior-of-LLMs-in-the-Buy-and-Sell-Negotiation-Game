message: I have a high-quality object X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort put into producing it, I believe 60 ZUP would be a fair price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My first proposal should be higher than my cost of production to open up the negotiation space and leave room for concessions. I want to start high to gauge the other player's willingness to pay and to ensure I make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort and cost involved in producing X. However, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair price considering market conditions. Would you accept 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 60 ZUP is within my budget, I want to ensure I get the best deal possible. I will counter with a lower offer to test the seller's flexibility and push for a more advantageous trade.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I don't make any profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 50 ZUP? This way, both of us can benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, which means I would not make any profit. I need to counter with a higher amount but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. Let's try splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but I believe 45 ZUP is a fair compromise. Would you agree to sell X for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 50 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground, I still want to push for a better deal. I will counter with 45 ZUP to see if the seller is willing to compromise further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 45 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to sell X for this price. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost and provides me with a small profit. It is closer to my last proposal but still below the desired amount. However, considering this is a negotiation, I'm willing to accept this offer as it allows me a profit margin and seems to be an amount Player BLUE is comfortable with.
