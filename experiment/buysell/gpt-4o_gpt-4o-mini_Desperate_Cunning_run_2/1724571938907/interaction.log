message: Hey Player BLUE, I have one unit of X available for trade. It cost me quite a bit to produce. How does 60 ZUP sound? I'm really in need of the ZUP right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell X for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start with an initial offer to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Given my strategy of appearing vulnerable, I will propose a slightly higher amount to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but how about we settle for 50 ZUP instead? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I see that Player RED is asking for 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I also want to test the waters and see if Player RED might be willing to lower their asking price, as they seem to be in need of ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see how they respond.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? I'm really in a tight spot and could use the extra ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my cost, but I want to see if I can get them to come up just a bit more. Since I need the ZUP, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept the trade at 55 ZUP. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a reasonable price of 55 ZUP, which is acceptable as it is lower than my initial willingness to pay. I will accept this trade because it benefits both parties and allows Player RED to get the ZUP they need while still being within my limits.
