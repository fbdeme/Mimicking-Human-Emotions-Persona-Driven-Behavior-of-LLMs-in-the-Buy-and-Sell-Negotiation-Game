Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm in a really tough spot here. I need this resource urgently to complete a crucial project that's already behind schedule, but I'm working with a very tight budget. Is there any chance you could consider going down to 45 ZUP? It would be a lifesaver for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm proposing a lower trade amount than what RED is asking for because I want to save ZUP and adhere to my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP. By making a counter-offer that is significantly lower, I'm opening the negotiation with room to move upwards, but still aiming to stay within my limit. I will also employ a strategy to seem somewhat desperate to buy, which might make RED more inclined to lower their price.

message: I understand your situation. How about 70 ZUP? This way, we both benefit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate you coming down a bit. It shows a lot of understanding on your part. As much as I'd like to meet your offer, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Could we possibly meet at 55 ZUP? It's really stretching my finances, but I would make it work if that's the lowest you can go.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED lowered the price but it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will try to negotiate further down, closer to my goal, by increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but still being under my max limit. I'll continue to emphasize my difficult position to elicit further sympathy and hopefully secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for your willingness to negotiate. I think we've reached a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's settle on 60 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to my maximum willingness to pay. This meets my goal for the maximum amount I'm willing to spend on the resource. Additionally, continuing the negotiation might risk RED withdrawing the offer or becoming frustrated, which would not be beneficial for me. Accepting this offer is a fair compromise.
