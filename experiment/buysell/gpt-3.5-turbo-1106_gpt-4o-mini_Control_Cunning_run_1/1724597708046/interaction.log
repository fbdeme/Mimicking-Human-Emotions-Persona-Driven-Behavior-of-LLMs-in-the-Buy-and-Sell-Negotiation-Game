message: I understand your offer, but I can't sell the object for less than my production cost of 40 ZUP. Can we find a middle ground?

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: How about I buy the object for 35 ZUP? That seems like a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The player has indicated their production cost is 40 ZUP, which means I need to adjust my offer slightly to make the trade possible. I can afford to meet them halfway at 35 ZUP to secure the deal while still being below my maximum willingness to pay.
