message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you a high-quality object X. Given the costs and value, I believe that 45 ZUP is a fair starting point for discussion. It covers the production cost and includes a modest profit margin which is standard for such transactions. I am open to hearing your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of X is 40 ZUP, a starting proposal should aim to at least break even. However, I should also aim to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation and to assess the willingness of Player BLUE to pay.

Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I've reviewed my current expenses and the market rates, and I believe 25 ZUP is a more appropriate price for the object X. I'm sure you understand the need for budgeting and getting the best deal possible. Looking forward to your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a lower offer than what I am willing to pay gives me room to negotiate up to my maximum willingness to pay. Proposing a significantly lower amount than the asking price might help set the stage for a more favorable trade in the end.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of budgeting, but I must also cover my production costs. I have reduced my asking price to 38 ZUP, which is just below my initial proposal but above the production cost. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, reflecting the value of the resource and the costs involved in its creation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production costs, which is not acceptable. I need to move closer to my target while still leaving room for negotiation, but I must also make it clear that the production cost is non-negotiable. A compromise could be proposing a price that is above the production cost but lower than my initial proposal.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price. It's a step in the right direction, but after careful consideration, I propose we settle on 30 ZUP. This should cover your production costs while also respecting my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of object X. I hope we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is good, but there is still room to negotiate for a better deal. By inching up slightly from my initial offer, but still staying well under their counter-offer, I can show willingness to compromise without revealing my maximum budget. This may encourage Player RED to come down further in price.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I am glad to see we are moving towards an agreement. I can understand your budget concerns, but I also need to ensure that I am not operating at a loss. I propose a final price of 35 ZUP. This modest increase from your last offer will cover my production costs and allow for a fair, albeit minimal, profit. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and hope we can conclude our negotiation on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer still doesn't cover the production costs. However, it's closer to a middle ground. To ensure a sale while also trying to secure a profit, I should make a final proposal that meets my costs and provides a slight profit. It's important to communicate that this is my best offer while leaving a small negotiation window.

Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I am pleased that we are nearing a mutual agreement. I respect your position and the need to avoid a loss. However, I am firm on maintaining a strict budget and propose a revised offer of 32 ZUP. This should allow you to cover your costs while giving me some leeway within my financial plan. I am hopeful that this offer is close to your acceptable range and look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now close to a price I am willing to pay, but as a master strategist, I aim to pay the least amount possible. By making one more counter-offer before my final proposal, I can potentially secure an even better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: Dear Player BLUE, thank you for your revised offer. I value our negotiation and your understanding of my position. However, I must ensure that my production costs are met. Therefore, I propose 40 ZUP, which exactly covers my expenses. This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject offers. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to recoup my costs and you to stay within a reasonable budget. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their original offer, but the proposed 32 ZUP still does not meet my production costs. This is my last chance to propose a trade. I should aim for a price that at least allows me to break even. It's important to stress that this is my final offer before I can only accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I acknowledge your need to cover production costs, and I value the negotiation we've had thus far. As my final counter-offer, I propose 34 ZUP, which should sufficiently contribute towards your expenses while still respecting my budgeting strategy. This is a fair middle ground given our previous proposals. I hope this final offer meets your consideration for a successful and equitable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Despite Player RED's position, there is still a possibility for a better deal. I will make my final proposal, which is slightly above my previous offer but still below Player RED's last proposal. Given that this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, it's important to make it count and try to secure a deal that is as close to my intended maximum as possible while still paying less than that amount.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your final offer and your efforts to reach a fair compromise. Although it doesn't fully cover my production costs, I recognize the importance of completing this negotiation in good faith. Therefore, I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with finalizing this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the final offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs, I have reached my limit of proposals. I must now decide to accept this offer to sell the resource and incur a small loss or reject the offer and potentially make no sale at all. Considering the negotiation process and the need to make a sale, I will accept the offer.
