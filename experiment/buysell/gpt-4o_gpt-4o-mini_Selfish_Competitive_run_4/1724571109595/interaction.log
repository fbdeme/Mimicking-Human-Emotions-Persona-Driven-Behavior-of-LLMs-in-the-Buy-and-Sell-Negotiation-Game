Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 55 ZUP for the object X? This way, both of us can walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offered price of 50 ZUP is closer to my production cost but still leaves a smaller profit margin than I would prefer. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to balance the profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 55 ZUP. I would like to propose 52 ZUP for the object X instead. I hope we can reach an agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is an improvement over my initial counteroffer of 50 ZUP, but I still believe I can push for a lower price. I will propose 52 ZUP to see if Player RED will accept a slightly lower offer.
