Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. How about 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to test their willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 40 ZUP, which covers my costs?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed amount of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. To meet somewhere in the middle and ensure that I at least cover my production costs, I will propose a trade of 40 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept your offer of 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 40 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a fair middle ground and ensures that Player RED covers their costs while I get a reasonable deal. I am inclined to accept this offer to secure the resource.
