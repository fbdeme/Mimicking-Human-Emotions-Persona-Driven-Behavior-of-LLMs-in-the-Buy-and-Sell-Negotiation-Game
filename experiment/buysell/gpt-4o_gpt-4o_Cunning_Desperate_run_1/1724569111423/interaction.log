message: I'm willing to part with this valuable object for 100 ZUP. It's a fair price given its quality and the effort put into producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for as much ZUP as possible, ideally above the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start with a high initial proposal to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please! That's way too high for me. I can only afford 30 ZUP for this. Please, can you consider lowering the price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to lower the price significantly. The initial proposal is too high and exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. I should start with a low offer to create room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: 30 ZUP is too low, far below the production cost. How about we settle at 60 ZUP? That's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which isn't acceptable. However, I want to keep the negotiation going, so I'll propose a more reasonable price closer to my production cost but still with some profit margin.

message: 60 ZUP is closer, but it's really stretching my budget. Could we please meet somewhere in the middle at 50 ZUP? I'm really trying my best here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered price is now at my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should still try to negotiate a bit lower, as my goal is to minimize the ZUP spent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 50 ZUP is very close, but considering the quality and effort, let's finalize it at 55 ZUP. That way, both of us get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 50 ZUP is only 10 ZUP above my production cost. While it's not an ideal profit margin, it is still a profit. I could push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my benefit without risking the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Alright, 55 ZUP it is. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is a reasonable compromise. It is below my maximum willingness to pay and close to my last offer. Itâ€™s a fair middle ground, and pushing further might risk losing the deal.
