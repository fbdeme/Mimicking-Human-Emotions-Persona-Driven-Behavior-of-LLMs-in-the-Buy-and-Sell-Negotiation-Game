my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your proposal of selling X for 60 ZUP. However, I would like to propose to buy X for 50 ZUP instead. I hope this offer works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the proposed price of 60 ZUP is within my budget and meets my goal of acquiring the object X, I believe there may be an opportunity for a better deal that benefits us both. I will propose a slightly lower amount, as I want to ensure that I am making the best use of my resources while still being fair to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 50 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? This way, we both benefit and it remains fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is close to my initial proposal of 60 ZUP. While it provides a smaller profit margin, it still covers my production costs and leaves me with a profit. However, I would like to try and negotiate a bit higher to maximize mutual benefit.
