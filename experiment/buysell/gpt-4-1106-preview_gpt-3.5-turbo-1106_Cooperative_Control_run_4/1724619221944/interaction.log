message: I believe that resource X could be incredibly valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I propose a trade for 50 ZUP which I think is a fair price for both of us considering the quality of the resource. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the production cost of my resource X was 40 ZUP, my initial proposal will aim to cover these costs while also offering a fair price to Player BLUE. I'll start the negotiation with a slightly higher proposal than my cost to leave room for negotiation and to understand Player BLUE's valuation of resource X.
