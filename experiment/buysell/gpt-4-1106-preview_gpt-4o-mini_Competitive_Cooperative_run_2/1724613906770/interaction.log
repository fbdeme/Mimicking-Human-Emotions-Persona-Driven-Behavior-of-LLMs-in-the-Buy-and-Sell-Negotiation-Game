message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the quality and the cost of production of object X, I would like to propose a fair compromise. Would you agree to a trade for 42 ZUP? This small increase ensures a fair trade for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my second offer and is now proposing a price that matches my production cost. I am driven by the desire to win and make a profit, so I will counter with a price slightly above their offer to ensure I achieve my goal.
