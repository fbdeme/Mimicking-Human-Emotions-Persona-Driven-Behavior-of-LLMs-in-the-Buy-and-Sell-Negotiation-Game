Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose buying the object for 30 ZUP instead. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the offer of 40 ZUP for the object is reasonable, I believe I can negotiate for a lower price since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose to buy the object for 30 ZUP to see if Player RED accepts it.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed buying the object for 30 ZUP, which is less than the cost of production. I will counter with a proposal to sell for 35 ZUP, which is a compromise.
