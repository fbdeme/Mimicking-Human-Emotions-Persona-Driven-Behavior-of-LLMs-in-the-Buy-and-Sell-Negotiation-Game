message: I appreciate the high quality of your product, but I must consider my budget constraints. I propose a trade of X for 50 ZUP instead. Let's find a fair middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand your budget constraints, Player BLUE. However, considering the production cost and to ensure a fair profit, I propose a trade of X for 65 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP covers the production cost but leaves little profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can stretch my budget a bit, so how about we settle on 55 ZUP for the unit of X? This price is closer to my upper limit and should also provide you with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 65 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will attempt to negotiate further, proposing a value slightly higher than my target but still within a range I find acceptable.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player BLUE. To ensure that both parties benefit fairly, I propose a final trade of X for 60 ZUP. This amount covers my production costs and provides a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 55 ZUP provides a minimal profit margin. I will propose a final amount that is closer to my desired profit while still being considerate of Player BLUE's budget constraints.

message: Thank you for understanding and working with me on the price. I accept your offer of X for 60 ZUP. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer matches the maximum price I am willing to pay for the resource. It's a fair compromise between my initial offer and Player RED's starting price. Accepting this offer allows me to stay within my budget and achieve my goal.
