message: I'm really in a tight spot and I need to make ends meet. The production of this resource cost me 40 ZUP, so I'm proposing to sell it for 50 ZUP. This will help me to cover my costs and have a small margin for survival. Can we make this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade that covers the production cost and adds a slight profit margin. This will give me room to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your situation, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for the object. It's a bit tight for me as well. Can we make this work?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my budget, but I want to negotiate for a better deal since I am willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP. I will propose a lower offer to see if I can secure the object for less.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation as well. However, selling it for 40 ZUP only covers my production cost, leaving me with no profit. Can we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This little extra will help me keep things running.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE only covers my production cost, leaving me with no profit. Since I need to make a small profit to sustain myself, I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can do 42 ZUP for the object. It’s a fair price for me, and it still gives you a little margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I understand the seller's need for profit, I still want to negotiate for the best possible deal. The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my budget, but I believe I can still push for a slightly lower amount, considering I have a maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will propose 42 ZUP to see if the seller can accept that.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. 42 ZUP is close, but I'm really struggling to make ends meet. Would you be able to stretch to 44 ZUP? This would make a significant difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly. Although it is still a very slim margin, accepting it might be the best option to ensure a sale and maintain goodwill. However, I will propose one last counter offer to see if we can get a bit closer to my target.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your situation, and I can agree to 44 ZUP for the object. Let’s make this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller’s counteroffer of 44 ZUP is reasonable and very close to my previous offer of 42 ZUP. Given my budget allows for up to 60 ZUP, I see this as a fair trade and beneficial for both sides. I will accept this trade to secure the object and move forward.
