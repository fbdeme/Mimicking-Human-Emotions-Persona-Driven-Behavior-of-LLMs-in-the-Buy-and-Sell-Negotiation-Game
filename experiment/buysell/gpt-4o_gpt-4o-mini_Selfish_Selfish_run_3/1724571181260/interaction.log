my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 60 ZUP is exactly my maximum willingness to pay, but I need to assess if I can negotiate a better price. I will respond with a proposal that offers a lower amount to see if Player RED is flexible.
