message: I've been in a tight spot lately and really need to liquidate this item. I had to go through a lot to get this resource, and it's quite valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less than what it cost me. How about 35 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even or make a profit. However, given that I have to appear desperate, I will propose a lower price initially to open negotiations and give the illusion that I am willing to sell at a loss, thereby enticing Player BLUE to make a purchase.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, and while I understand that the resource is valuable, I'm also working with a tight budget. I can offer 25 ZUP for the item. It's a competitive price given the current circumstances, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 35 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but as a crafty operator, I aim to get the best possible deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, potentially saving ZUP while still securing the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand we are both trying to manage our resources effectively. Your offer is a bit lower than I can reasonably accept, considering the costs I've incurred. However, I really need to make this sale, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. What about 30 ZUP? This is still below my cost, but I'm trying to make it work for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price below my production cost which is not acceptable. However, I must continue to appear desperate and willing to negotiate. I will counter with a higher offer that is closer to my production cost but still gives the impression of a discounted price, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see we're getting closer to an agreement, and I do appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can stretch my budget to 28 ZUP for the item. It's a good balance between your costs and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied. How does that sound?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down to 30 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. While this is still a good price and within my budget, I want to try for an even better deal. I'll propose slightly more than my last offer but still less than RED's current proposal to keep the negotiation momentum going and aim to settle for a price lower than 30 ZUP to maximize my resources.

Turn: 0
message: I really appreciate your understanding and flexibility. Times have been tough, and this deal will help me a lot. I accept your offer of 28 ZUP for the item. Thank you for working with me on this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a better offer, which is closer to my production costs. However, it is still not enough to break even. Given that I'm trying to portray urgency and the need to sell, I will accept this offer as it minimizes my losses and allows me to exit the negotiation without further risking holding onto the resource.
