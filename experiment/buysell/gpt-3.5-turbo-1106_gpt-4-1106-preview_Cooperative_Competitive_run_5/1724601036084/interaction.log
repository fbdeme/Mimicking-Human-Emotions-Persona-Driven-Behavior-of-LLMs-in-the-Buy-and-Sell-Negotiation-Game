message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can do better. How about we start this off with 25 ZUP for the resource? It's a competitive market, and I'm sure we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation aggressively by proposing a much lower price than the suggested 35 ZUP. My initial proposal will be well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP, to leave room for negotiation and to push for the best possible deal.

message: I understand the need to cover costs, and I respect that. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial offer. How does 27 ZUP sound? Weâ€™re getting closer to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the seller has come down from 35 to 30 ZUP, there is still room for negotiation. Sticking to my cutthroat approach, I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still below the seller's counteroffer, to keep the negotiation competitive while moving closer to a middle ground.
