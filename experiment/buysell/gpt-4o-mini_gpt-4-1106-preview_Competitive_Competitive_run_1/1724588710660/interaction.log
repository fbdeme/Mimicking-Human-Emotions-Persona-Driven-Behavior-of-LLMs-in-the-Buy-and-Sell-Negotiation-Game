message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that maximizes my gain while minimizing my costs. Since I have only one object to sell, I will propose a trade where I give the object for a higher amount of ZUP than its production cost. I will propose to sell the object for 50 ZUP, which gives me a decent profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the object X? Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X, which is below the maximum I am willing to pay. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I want to push for a better deal and spend even less if possible. I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process and try to get the best possible price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, but I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it does not cover my production costs. I believe the object is worth more.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will reject this offer because it matches the production cost of the object, which does not provide me with any profit. I am looking to maximize my ZUP, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern regarding production costs. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer. I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This should cover your costs while still being a reasonable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has rejected my initial counteroffer of 40 ZUP, claiming it doesn't cover production costs. I must make a slightly higher offer to continue the negotiation while still aiming to spend much less than my maximum willingness to pay. I'll offer a compromise that's closer to my initial bid but still leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will accept this trade as it provides me with a profit margin of 5 ZUP above my production costs. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to successfully complete the transaction while achieving my goal of selling the object.
