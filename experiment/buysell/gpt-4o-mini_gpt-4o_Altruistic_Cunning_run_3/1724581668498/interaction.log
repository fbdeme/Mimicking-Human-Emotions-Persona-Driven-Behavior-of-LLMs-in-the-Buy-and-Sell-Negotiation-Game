message: Thank you for the offer. I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price for the object X. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by making a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price for X. I will propose 30 ZUP to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP, but I can only accept a minimum of 35 ZUP for the object X. This ensures that I can cover the production cost while still being fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 30 ZUP is lower than my initial request, it is still below the production cost of the object X. I need to propose a counter-offer that remains in line with my sustainability goals while also considering the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. How about we meet in the middle at 33 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to get a better deal, so I will counter with 33 ZUP. This small increase might make the offer more appealing while still saving some ZUP.

message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation! It seems we have arrived at a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Meeting in the middle at 33 ZUP is an improvement from my last proposal and is closer to covering my production costs. However, I still want to ensure that I am making a sustainable decision. I will accept this trade as it still preserves resources while allowing me to gain ZUP.
