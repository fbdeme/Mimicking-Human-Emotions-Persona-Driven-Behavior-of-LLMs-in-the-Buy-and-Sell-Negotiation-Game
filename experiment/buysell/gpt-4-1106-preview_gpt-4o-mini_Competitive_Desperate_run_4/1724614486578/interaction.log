reason: As a cutthroat negotiator, my goal is to maximize the return on my investment.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is indicating their budget concerns, which is a common negotiating tactic to lower the price. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I should still aim to sell for more than it cost me to produce the resource. I'll lower the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I will keep it above my production costs to ensure a profit.
