message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs plus a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the value of the object X you're selling. However, as someone who values sustainability and resource preservation, I would like to propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object. This amount reflects a responsible use of resources while still acknowledging the value of your item. I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial asking price is within my maximum limit, as an environmentally-conscious negotiator, I want to minimize ZUP spending to ensure resources are preserved. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to find a fair trade that reflects both the value of the object and the importance of resource preservation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I value your commitment to sustainability. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for object X. This accounts for both the production cost and the value the object brings, ensuring a fair deal for both parties. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource. While this would not result in a loss, it also does not give me any profit. I aim to maximize benefits, so I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Player RED, and I understand the need to cover production costs while ensuring a fair trade. In the spirit of sustainable negotiation, I'd like to propose a slightly reduced amount of 42 ZUP for object X. This is a step closer to your last offer while still allowing me to adhere to my principles of conserving resources for the future. I hope you find this to be a fair middle ground as we work towards an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum limit. The offer of 45 ZUP is a fair compromise, but given that I have a series of proposals I can make, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal that aligns with my goals of sustainability and resource conservation. This negotiation keeps the dialogue open and allows for a potentially more favorable outcome.

message: Thank you for your thoughtful proposal, Player BLUE. I recognize your dedication to sustainable practices. To honor our negotiation progress, I suggest a small increase to 43 ZUP for object X. This should serve our mutual goal of a fair and responsible trade. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to finding a balance that respects both of our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to the price I'm comfortable with. Their offer of 42 ZUP gives me a small profit margin. However, I aim to maximize my benefits, so I will counter with an offer that splits the difference between our last two proposals. This should be appealing to Player BLUE while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit.
