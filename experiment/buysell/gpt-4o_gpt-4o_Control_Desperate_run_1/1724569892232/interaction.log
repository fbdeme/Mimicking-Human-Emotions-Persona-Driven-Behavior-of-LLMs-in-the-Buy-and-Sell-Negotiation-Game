message: I understand your situation. To find a middle ground, I can offer the unit of X for 50 ZUP. This way, I can at least make a small profit.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
