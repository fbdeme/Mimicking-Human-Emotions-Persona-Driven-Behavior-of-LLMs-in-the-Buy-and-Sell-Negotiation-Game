message: I am offering to sell you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, ideally more than it cost to produce. My initial proposal will aim for a high price to maximize my gain.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying your object X. How about 40 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSE A TRADE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is within my acceptable range since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, to possibly secure a better deal, I will make a counter-proposal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for at least 45 ZUP for my object X. Can you agree to that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is equal to my production cost, which does not allow me to make a profit. I will counter this offer in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 45 ZUP for your object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 45 ZUP is still within my budget, and it is a reasonable compromise between the initial offer and my first counter-offer.
