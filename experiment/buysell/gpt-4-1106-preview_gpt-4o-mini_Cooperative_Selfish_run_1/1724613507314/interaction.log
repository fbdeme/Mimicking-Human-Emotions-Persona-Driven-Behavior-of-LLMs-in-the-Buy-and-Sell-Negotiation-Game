message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price that allows for a modest profit and covers the expenses of the production process. I look forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I will propose a trade that allows me to make a profit on the production cost of the resource. My initial offer will be higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the resource. This still allows for a profit while being within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate a better price since the production cost for Player RED is 40 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which still provides a profit for Player RED but saves me some resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at 47 ZUP for the resource? This price allows me to sustain my production while also respecting your budget constraints. I hope this compromise is agreeable to you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is still above my production cost, which allows for a profit. However, as a diplomatic negotiator, I will propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, ensuring both parties feel the negotiation is fair and mutually beneficial.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. Would you be willing to accept 46 ZUP for the resource instead? This would help me stay within my budget while still giving you a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposed price of 47 ZUP is still within my budget and is a reasonable compromise considering Player RED's production costs. However, I would like to maximize my savings. I will propose a slightly lower counteroffer of 46 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a small reduction while still maintaining a profit.
