Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement. How about I offer 30 ZUP for one unit of X? Let's work towards a deal that's great for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer by Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, as a shrewd negotiator, I should aim to reduce the cost even further to conserve my resources. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I can come up a bit to meet you partway. What do you think about 32 ZUP for one unit of X? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. There might be room for further negotiation, but I must be careful not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer but still below their last asking price to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I see the value in your offer and would like to proceed with the purchase. Let's finalize the deal at 33 ZUP for one unit of X. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is holding firm at 33 ZUP, which is still a favorable price for me as it is below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon to avoid reaching my maximum proposal count without a successful negotiation. I'll accept their offer to secure the resource at a reasonable price.
