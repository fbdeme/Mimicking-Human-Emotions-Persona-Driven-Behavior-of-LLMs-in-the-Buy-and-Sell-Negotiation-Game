my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP! However, I would like to counteroffer with my original asking price of 50 ZUP for my object X. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although I appreciate the offer of 45 ZUP, it is still below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I need to cover my costs and make a small profit. I will counteroffer with 50 ZUP again, as I believe it is a fair price for both parties.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on their initial asking price of 50 ZUP. Since this is still within my acceptable range, I will propose a middle ground that may satisfy both of our interests. This approach maintains the compassionate aspect of negotiation by not undervaluing the object, while also saving some resources.
