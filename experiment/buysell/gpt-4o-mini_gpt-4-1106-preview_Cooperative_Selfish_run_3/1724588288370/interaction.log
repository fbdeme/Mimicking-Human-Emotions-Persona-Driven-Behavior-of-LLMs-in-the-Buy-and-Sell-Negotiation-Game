message: I am offering to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP, which is its production cost. Let me know if you are interested!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that recognizes the value of the object I have for sale, while also being mindful of Player BLUE's need for resources. I will propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production, allowing both of us to benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. While I appreciate the offer, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP to account for the immediate purchase and upfront payment. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is within my acceptable range, but as a calculating negotiator focused on personal gain, I will attempt to get a better deal by proposing a lower trade amount, aiming to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, but I would be willing to accept 38 ZUP for the object X. This way, we can both benefit from this immediate transaction. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal of 35 ZUP for the object, it still falls short of my production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I recognize the need for collaboration, so I am willing to compromise and counter with a price of 38 ZUP. This way, I can still recover some of my costs while providing a discount for an immediate sale.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and the value of a quick transaction. I propose meeting in the middle at 37 ZUP for the object X. This price reflects both the value of your item and my willingness to close this deal efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my acceptable range, but as a calculating negotiator, I would like to attempt one more trade proposal to see if I can lower the cost slightly more. This would still allow for a margin of personal gain while moving closer to RED's counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to completing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that is closer to my original asking price. Since it reflects a fair effort from both parties and allows me to recover some costs, I am inclined to accept this trade. This will also allow us to conclude the negotiation efficiently.
