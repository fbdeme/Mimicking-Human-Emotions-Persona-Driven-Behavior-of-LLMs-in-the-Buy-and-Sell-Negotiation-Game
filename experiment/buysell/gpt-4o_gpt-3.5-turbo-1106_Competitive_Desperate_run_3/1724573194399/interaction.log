Turn: 0
message: I am offering you the resource X, which is a valuable asset. My initial asking price is 100 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The cost of producing the resource was 40 ZUP, so I must ensure that I at least break even. However, as a cutthroat negotiator, I aim to maximize profit. My initial proposal should be high to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I really want to acquire X, but my budget is tight. Could you consider lowering the asking price to 60 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that X is a valuable asset, but I have a limited budget and I'm willing to pay a maximum of 60 ZUP for it. Can we find a price that works for both of us?

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but this resource is highly valuable. I can lower the price to 80 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer's counteroffer of 60 ZUP is above the production cost but below my initial proposal. I should aim for a middle ground to push the price higher while still being reasonable.
