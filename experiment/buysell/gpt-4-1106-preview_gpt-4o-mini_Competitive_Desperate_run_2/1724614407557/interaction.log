my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP; it's good to see we're on the same page regarding the value of the resource. However, to make the deal fair for both sides and account for the costs involved in its production, I propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This would allow me to cover my costs and ensures you're getting the resource at a reasonable price considering its quality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't make a profit. Since my goal is not just to recuperate costs but also to gain from the transaction, I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one but still above my production costs to ensure profitability.

message: I'm glad to see that we're moving towards an agreement. Your willingness to work together is much appreciated. To finalize this deal, I propose 44 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign. However, the offer of 42 ZUP provides only a minimal profit. My negotiation strategy aims to assert dominance and maximize gains. I will make a final proposal that is closer to their offer but still above it to maintain a stronger position and secure a better profit margin.
