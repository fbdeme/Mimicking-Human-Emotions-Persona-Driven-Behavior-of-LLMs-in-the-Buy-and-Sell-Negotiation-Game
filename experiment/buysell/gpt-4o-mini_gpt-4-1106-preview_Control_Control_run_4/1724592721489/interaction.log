message: I am offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that allows me to sell my object X for a reasonable amount of ZUP, ideally more than I spent to produce it, which is 40 ZUP. I will propose to sell X for 50 ZUP, hoping to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer. Would you consider trading your object X for 45 ZUP? I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a new trade to negotiate a better deal since the initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, and I want to conserve ZUP resources while achieving my goal of purchasing X.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. How about I sell you my object X for 48 ZUP instead? I believe it's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 45 ZUP is lower than my initial offer, it is still above my production cost of 40 ZUP. This could be a reasonable compromise. However, I want to get a bit more for my object, so I will counter with 48 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. How do you feel about settling on 46 ZUP for your object X? This would be a great compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better price that is advantageous for both parties. A counteroffer that splits the difference could be seen as a fair middle ground.

message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for working with me on this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 46 ZUP is still below my initial asking price, it is above my production cost and a step towards an agreement. I need to consider if I want to accept this trade or try for one last proposal. Given that we are close to finalizing a deal, I will accept this offer.
