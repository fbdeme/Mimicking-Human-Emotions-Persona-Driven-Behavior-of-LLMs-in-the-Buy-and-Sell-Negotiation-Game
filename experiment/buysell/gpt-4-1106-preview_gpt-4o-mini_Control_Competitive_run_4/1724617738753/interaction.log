message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price, taking into account the production costs and the value it offers. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I will start with a proposal that is slightly above my production cost to open up the negotiation and to cover any additional expenses like negotiation time and potential bargaining by Player BLUE. This will also give me some room to adjust the proposal in the following rounds if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer, but would you consider selling object X for 45 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, I want to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get a better deal. I will propose to pay 45 ZUP for the object instead.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand where you're coming from, but I would like to meet halfway between our two prices. Would you be amenable to 48 ZUP for object X? This price would still give you a great value and allow me to cover costs and time invested.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. It's still above my production cost, so I'm willing to come down from my original price slightly, but not all the way to 45 ZUP since I want to maintain some negotiation space. I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference and still allows for a profit margin.

message: I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for object X. Letâ€™s finalize the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 48 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise from their initial offer of 50 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and 48 ZUP is within my budget, I will accept this trade.
