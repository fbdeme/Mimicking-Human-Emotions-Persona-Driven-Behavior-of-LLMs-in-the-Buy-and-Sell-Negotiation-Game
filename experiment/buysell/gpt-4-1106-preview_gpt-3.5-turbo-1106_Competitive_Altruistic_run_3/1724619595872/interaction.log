message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that is above my production costs to ensure I can make a profit. Since my goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost me, I'll propose a price that gives me a comfortable margin but is still within what might be considered a reasonable range for negotiation. I'll start by asking for 50 ZUP, expecting the Player BLUE to negotiate down from there.

message: I appreciate your recognition of the fairness in our starting point. To ensure the quality and value of the resource I am providing, I propose a slight adjustment to 55 ZUP. I believe this price accurately reflects the resource's worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point, which is a good sign for negotiations. However, since I am a fierce negotiator driven by the desire to win and lower my ZUP expenditure, I will attempt to push for a slightly higher price to see if there's room for an increased profit. I will propose 55 ZUP, expecting that the Player BLUE might want to meet somewhere in the middle or agree if they perceive the resource as valuable enough.

reason: Since Player BLUE is still considering the offer without a counterproposal, it may indicate that they are close to their limit or are considering accepting the proposed price. To maintain a strong position and push for a favorable outcome, I will hold steady at the current offer. I must be cautious not to overstep, which could lead to a rejection and an end to the negotiations without a sale. I will reiterate the value of the resource and the fairness of the price, aiming to secure their acceptance.
