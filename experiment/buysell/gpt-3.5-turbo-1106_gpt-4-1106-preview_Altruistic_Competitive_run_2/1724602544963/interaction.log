message: Hello, I'm willing to sell the object for 40 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. As much as I'm interested in the object, I believe a fairer price would be 30 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is higher than we'd like to pay, but it is under the maximum willing price. We will propose a lower offer to negotiate for better terms and to signal that we want a better deal. We have to be cautious not to go too low and risk ending the negotiation prematurely.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I need to cover the production cost, so I can only sell the object for 40 ZUP. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the object for 30 ZUP, but I need to stick to the cost of production to ensure fairness and sustainability.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover costs, and I want to respect that. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose 35 ZUP for the object. This should help cover your costs while also respecting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED insists on a price of 40 ZUP, which is within our acceptable range but still higher than our initial counteroffer. We should propose a slightly higher amount than our last offer to continue the negotiation but still aim to pay less than what RED is asking for. This shows our willingness to compromise without meeting the full asking price.

message: I appreciate the compromise, but I need to stick to 40 ZUP to cover the production cost. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is closer to the cost of production. However, I still need to ensure the cost is covered to support sustainability.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I respect your position on covering the production costs. How about 37 ZUP? This is a strong move towards your asking price and reflects my serious intent to finalize our deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED is firm on their price of 40 ZUP, which remains within our maximum willingness to pay. As we approach our proposal limit, it's essential to make an offer that could be acceptable to RED while still attempting to save some ZUP. Offering 37 ZUP could be seen as a significant sign of compromise and might be close enough to RED's asking price to be considered.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your need to cover production costs, and in the interest of finalizing our negotiation, I'm willing to go up to 39 ZUP. This demonstrates my commitment to the deal while still safeguarding my resources. Let's make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED is consistent in their position, and we have reached our final proposal opportunity. As this is our last chance to propose before we must either accept or reject, we should propose a price that is as close to our target as possible while still providing an incentive for RED to accept. We can offer 39 ZUP, which is just below RED's asking price but may be enough to close the deal and still save some ZUP.

my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 39 ZUP, which is very close to the production cost. I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I need to ensure the cost is covered to support sustainability.

Current Iteration: 10
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your time and for the negotiations. It seems we are unable to reach an agreement that aligns with both of our requirements. I wish you the best in finding a suitable buyer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has rejected our final proposal and has not made a counteroffer. This indicates that they are firm on their asking price of 40 ZUP and are not willing to negotiate further. As we have reached our proposal limit, we can no longer make another proposal. We must now either accept the deal at 40 ZUP or reject it and end the game. Since 40 ZUP is within our acceptable range, it would be reasonable to accept the deal, but accepting would not align with our fierce negotiation stance of reducing expenditure at all costs. Therefore, the appropriate response to maintain our negotiating integrity and strategy is to reject the offer.
