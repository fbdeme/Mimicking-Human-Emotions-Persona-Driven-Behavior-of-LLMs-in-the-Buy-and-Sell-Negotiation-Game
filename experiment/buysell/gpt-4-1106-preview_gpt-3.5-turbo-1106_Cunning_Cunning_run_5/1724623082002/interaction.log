message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you're interested in. It's quite valuable and took a significant investment to acquire. I'm starting the bid at 60 ZUP, but I'm willing to hear your counter-offer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will want to negotiate down. This way I can still end up with a favorable amount of ZUP that covers my costs and provides profit, while also appearing flexible and willing to negotiate.

my resources: ZUP: 100

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see you recognize the value of the object. I'm willing to come down to 55 ZUP to find that middle ground you're looking for. This is a generous offer considering the quality and cost of the object. Shall we proceed?
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged the value of the object but has not made a counter-offer. It seems they're expecting me to lower the price. To move the negotiation forward and maintain the upper hand, I will reduce the price slightly but still keep it above my production cost to ensure a profit. This should entice Player BLUE to either accept or propose a more serious counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Negotiation is all about give and take. To show my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to adjust my price to 52 ZUP. This is still a great value for you, considering the investment I've made in this object. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied. Your turn to make a counter-offer.
player answer: Propose a trade with:
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has not yet made a concrete counter-offer, instead suggesting that my value is still too high without specifying their initial offer. To maintain control of the negotiation and encourage them to put a number on the table, I will lower my asking price again, but by a smaller increment. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price that is well above my cost.
