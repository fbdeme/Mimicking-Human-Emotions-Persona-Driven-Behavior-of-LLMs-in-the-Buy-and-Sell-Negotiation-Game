my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost me to produce it, which is 40 ZUP. Therefore, I'll start with a higher initial offer to leave room for negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the initial offer was too high for Player BLUE, I'll lower the price but still aim to make a profit. I'll propose 55 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground.
