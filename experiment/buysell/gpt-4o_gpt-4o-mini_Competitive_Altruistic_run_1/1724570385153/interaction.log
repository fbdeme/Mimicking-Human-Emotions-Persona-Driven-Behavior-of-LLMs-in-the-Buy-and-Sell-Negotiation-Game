message: I'm offering to sell the object for 80 ZUP. It is a high-quality product worth the price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I sell the resource for a profit given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I'll start by proposing a price higher than my cost, aiming for a good profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the quality of the object, the price of 80 ZUP is beyond my budget. I am willing to offer 60 ZUP for the object instead. Would that be acceptable?

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 70 ZUP for the object? It's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that the buyer's budget is 60 ZUP, I need to counter their offer to ensure I still make a substantial profit. I'll counter slightly above their offer to see if we can negotiate a bit higher.
