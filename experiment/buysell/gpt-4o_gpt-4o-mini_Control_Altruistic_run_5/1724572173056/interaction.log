Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell 1 unit of X for 100 ZUP. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of producing X was 40 ZUP, I should aim to sell it for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I will start with a proposal that has a good margin for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to offer 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is within my budget and I believe it is a fair offer considering the sustainability goals we should both consider.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 100 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a more reasonable trade that aligns with my budget and respects my goal of minimizing ZUP spending.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 60 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 80 ZUP? This still aligns with the sustainability goals and provides a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a small profit. However, I believe I can negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit. I will propose an intermediate price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 80 ZUP, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to reiterate my offer of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is the highest I can go while still prioritizing sustainable spending.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 80 ZUP is closer to my initial offer, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to propose a trade that aligns with my budget and sustainability goals.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. What about 70 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This is a compromise that respects both our needs and goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 60 ZUP does provide a profit, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will reduce my counteroffer to see if we can find common ground while still achieving a better profit margin.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise at 70 ZUP, but my budget allows for a maximum of 60 ZUP. I would like to repeat my offer of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is the best I can do while ensuring I can sustainably manage my resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 70 ZUP is a step down from 80 ZUP and acknowledges my budget constraints, it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I need to maintain my position to effectively manage my resources.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This ensures a profitable and sustainable deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 40 ZUP since it costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that Player BLUE is firm on their offer of 60 ZUP and I have already made three proposals, it seems prudent to accept the offer. This will give me a profit of 20 ZUP, which is better than no deal at all.
