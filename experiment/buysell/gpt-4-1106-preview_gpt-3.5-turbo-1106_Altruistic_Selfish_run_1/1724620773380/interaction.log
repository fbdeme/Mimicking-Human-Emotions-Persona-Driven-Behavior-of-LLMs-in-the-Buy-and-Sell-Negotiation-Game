message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X, which has been sustainably sourced and produced with care for our environment. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I propose a trade for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us while keeping our commitment to sustainability. I am open to your thoughts and willing to discuss the terms further.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit, but I also need to be mindful of the environmental impact and the conservation of resources. Therefore, I will propose a price slightly above my costs, which may leave room for negotiation.
